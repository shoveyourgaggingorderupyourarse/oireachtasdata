Deputy Devlin has advised that he will be delayed, as has the Chairman, Deputy Stanley.  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  This morning, we will be engaging with officials from the Department of Social Protection to examine the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 37 - Social Protection, and the Social Insurance Fund.  From the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2020 report on the accounts of the public services, we will be examining chapter 9, on the regularity of social welfare payments; chapter 10, on the management of social welfare appeals; and chapter 11, regarding controls over the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.<\/p> <p>  Following last week&rsquo;s engagement with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, we also requested an update on the implementation of recommendations contained in chapter 20 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts of the public services from 2017, which concerned PRSI contributions, as well as an update on the implementation of a recommendation of the last Committee of Public Accounts arising from its examination of that chapter.  I thank the Secretary General for providing that information at short notice, as well as the information provided in relation to a parliamentary question tabled by me concerning expenditure by the Department in recent years on lighting and heating.<\/p> <p>  We are joined by the following officials from the Department of Social Protection: Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General; Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler, assistant secretary for finance; Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary for control; Ms Joan Gordon, chief appeals officer; and Ms Philomena McShane, chief accountant.  We are also joined remotely by Ms Jasmina Behan, principal officer, and Ms Ivana McGarr, assistant principal in the social protection Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, one of today&rsquo;s witnesses is giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  The witness has been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist the Broadcasting Unit and the Debates Office, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state their name the first time they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#A00800","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>As members will be aware, the Department of Social Protection operates a wide range of income support, welfare and labour activation schemes.  Expenditure on the schemes is divided between two accounts: the appropriation account for Vote 37, and the account of the Social Insurance Fund.  The Vote account is funded mainly through direct Exchequer issues, while the Social Insurance Fund is funded mainly from pay related social Insurance contributions.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure on scheme payments in 2020 totalled nearly &euro;30 billion.  This represented an increase of 48% on 2019 scheme expenditure, and included just over &euro;9 billion incurred in 2020 across three new Covid-19 related schemes: the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, scheme; the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS; and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The Department&rsquo;s expenditure on administration of the schemes amounted to a further &euro;635 million.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2019, the accumulated reserves in the Social Insurance Fund were &euro;3.9 billion.  During 2020, receipts into the fund totalled &euro;11.4 billion, while expenditure totalled &euro;14.8 billion.  The result was a deficit for the year of &euro;3.5 billion, and the accumulated reserves had fallen to &euro;453 million at the end of 2020.  I gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund for 2020.  However, I drew attention in my report on the Vote account to a material level of non-compliance with procurement rules as disclosed in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to chapter 9: regularity of social welfare payments.  For a variety of reasons, some welfare recipients may be paid amounts to which they are not entitled, or that exceed their entitlements.  These are classified as \"irregular payments\".  The Department conducts periodic control surveys of scheme payments to understand the level and causes of the excess payments that occur.  The results of the surveys point to a material incidence of payments in excess of entitlements under many welfare schemes.  As has been the case for several years, I have drawn attention to this in both audit certificates.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 10 covers management of social welfare appeals.  When a person is refused a social welfare payment by the Department, he or she can, in most cases, appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.  Overall, the rate of appeal of the Department&rsquo;s decisions on applicants&rsquo; claims is low.  In 2020, appeals lodged represented around 1.3% of the approximately two million decisions that were made in respect of claims for income support and other benefits.  However, the rate of appeal varies between schemes.  For example, more than 40% of the appeals received in 2020 related to just two schemes: disability allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance.  In 2020, just under 26,000 appeal decisions were finalised.  In more than half of the finalised cases, the appeals were successful from the perspective of the claimant.<\/p> <p>  As part of the examination, we analysed a sample of successful appeals in respect of three schemes, to identify why they succeeded.  This indicated that in 70% of the cases examined, material new evidence had been supplied as part of the appeal.  We found in the majority of these cases that the additional information provided at appeal augmented information provided at the original application stage, and that the appeals might have been avoided if the additional information had been provided or elicited earlier.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 11 examines controls over the Covid-19 PUP scheme.  As members will be aware, the scheme was devised and implemented in a very short period, at the same time as the Department had to adopt significantly restricted work practices.  I am happy to acknowledge that delivery of the scheme on such a scale and in such a short time represented a major achievement.  Given the volume of claims that were expected, and the potential loss of staff due to Covid-19, the Department implemented reduced take-on controls over PUP scheme claims when compared to other income support schemes, and recognised at the outset that the risk of overpayments would be higher than normal.  The Department deemed this to be necessary and appropriate, and in the public interest.  I do not disagree with that assessment.  However, the examination found that there was scope subsequently for the Department to make more timely use of opportunities to confirm eligibility for ongoing PUP payments.  The examination reviewed a random sample of claims from employees on the basis they were out of work due to Covid restrictions.  Such employee claimants accounted for 80% of the scheme expenditure in 2020.  We found evidence in records available to the Department that more than 9% of the claims reviewed were not eligible for the payments received on the dates tested.  This suggests there may have been a material level of irregular payments of employee claimants under the PUP scheme.  However, more extensive testing would be required to reach a precise estimate of the level of excess payment for the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The examination also reviewed a random sample of self-employed PUP claims.  We found that it was not possible to conclude on the eligibility of these claimants, due to the absence of evidence about the level of loss of business turnover due to Covid-19. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1639042200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for his presentation.

The amount of work and effort that went into getting the scheme up and running very quickly was a significant factor in avoiding distress for many people.

I also understand that the committee would like to review the accounts of the Social Insurance Fund and I will be pleased to respond to any questions that members may have on these accounts.<\/p> <p>  I am joined today by Ms Joan Gordon, chief appeals officer, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler, assistant secretary with responsibility for finance, Ms Philomena McShane, the Department&rsquo;s chief accountant, and Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary with responsibility for control policy.  I may, with the Vice Chairman's permission, rely on assistance from my colleagues in addressing some of the questions that members may raise.  I am particularly mindful of the notice given by the Vice Chairman at the beginning of this meeting.  I am a witness outside the curtilage, and I am self-isolating at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I arranged for an advance copy of this statement together with briefing material on the accounts and the chapters under review, the annual report of the Department, the annual statistics report and other relevant information to be provided to the committee secretariat.  I hope that members found this material to be of use.<\/p> <p>  I would like to commence by breaking precedent.  Normally, Accounting Officers conclude their statements at this meeting by acknowledging the work of their staff.  I hope that members will agree that, in the context of the 21 months just past, it is appropriate to place my appreciation and my pride in the Department&rsquo;s staff to the forefront of my comments.  The committee may think that this is due to the unprecedented response to Covid-19 crisis, and it is true that the measures taken to flatten the curve in the health domain resulted in an unprecedented peak in demand for income supports and other welfare services.  Over the period, the Department has built not just one but two new IT systems to process approximately 1.8 million claims for the PUP, equivalent to approximately nine years' worth of jobseeker's claims.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s staff processed more than 212,000 claims for the special Covid-19 illness payment, introduced a new enterprise support grant, implemented new flexible arrangements for rent supplement, rolled out online and telephone-based services for the General Register Office, GRO, appeals, medical assessments and employment services and developed new IT functionality to provide attributed or full social insurance contributions to people who were laid off during the Covid pandemic.  We also implemented a new protocol for victims of domestic abuse.  All of this was Covid-related and I could go on.  The Department has now distributed or funded some &euro;17.4 billion in expenditure on Covid-related supports.  Just as we thought we were making progress in transitioning back to normal operations, staff again worked over the past weekend to put a new PUP scheme in place and are already processing claims into payment for next week.<\/p><p> However, the past 21 months have not all been about Covid-19.  Having made substantial improvements in processing performance across most of our schemes and in the appeals service over the previous year, we were determined to protect these improvements.  In fact, across most scheme areas, processing performance continued to improve as more online options were implemented and staff adapted to new processes and to working remotely from the office.  To take just one example, carer's allowance claims, which took on average 14 weeks to process in 2019, are now being processed in about four weeks.<\/p><p> In parallel, staff of the Department rolled out new services including the benefit payment for 65-year-olds.  They developed new services and expanded others as part of the pathways to work strategy, established and supported the work of the Pensions Commission and enhanced our IT security and energy management capabilities.  Again, I could go on.<\/p><p> The efforts of staff have been recognised in a number of independent awards for customer communications and for professionalism in procurement.  In addition, in a world where cybersecurity and energy management are key concerns, the Department has also, over the past year, been awarded International Organization for Standardization, ISO, certification for information systems security management and for energy management conservation.  Ours is among the first Civil Service Departments to achieve these certifications.<\/p><p> I will say no more on this subject except for two things.  First, it is not uncommon to hear and see bandwagon criticism of the civil and public service as being cosseted, of not being innovative, of being inefficient or of lacking customer focus.  It may be a vain hope, but I hope that the evidence, not just in my Department but across the public service over the pandemic period, will help dispel these lazy caricatures.  Second, I am hugely proud to be associated with the work of the Department&rsquo;s staff and the 350 other public servants who worked with us on occasions over the past period.  I say \"associated\" because it is not my work but theirs and I hope the committee will join me in acknowledging that work and offering a heartfelt appreciation.<\/p><p> The committee will note, from the 2020 accounts, that total expenditure on Vote 37 services and administration, before appropriations-in-aid, amounted to &euro;16.5 billion.  This was &euro;5.6 billion higher than 2019 Vote expenditure of &euro;10.9 billion.  Out of this increase, &euro;5.4 billion related to expenditure on Covid income and employer supports.  Excluding this expenditure, the additional expenditure represented a small increase of 1.9% compared with 2019 spending.  If Covid-related expenditure is excluded from the comparisons, the expenditure for the year amounted to &euro;11.1 billion, an increase of &euro;200 million or 1.9% compared with 2019.<\/p><p> Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund services amounted to &euro;14.1 billion.  This was an increase of &euro;4.1 billion on the 2019 outturn.  Again, if Covid-related expenditure is excluded, the adjusted figures for 2020 show expenditure of &euro;10.4 billion, an increase of &euro;400 million or 3.7%.  Combined expenditure of &euro;30.5 billion across the spending period represents approximately 15% of modified gross national income for the year.<\/p><p> It is clear that there are a number of key drivers of this change, with &euro;265 million additional expenditure related to pensions, of which demographics account for &euro;218 million and &euro;47 million is related to pension budget measures.  Similarly, illness and invalidity payments increased by &euro;263 million.  As previously discussed at this committee, these demographic trends are likely to continue with significant implications for expenditure.  This issue was at the heart of the deliberations of the Pensions Commission and members will be aware the commission has made a number of proposals both with regard to mitigating the cost impact and generating the necessary revenue to fund the inevitable increases in expenditure.  These proposals are now being considered by the Government and have also been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  Taking account of inputs from these bodies, it is expected that the Government will provide its response by the end of March 2022.<\/p><p> Chapter 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report is concerned with control over welfare payments.  Chapter 11 is specifically concerned with control of the PUP.  Chapter 9 makes no recommendations but chapter 11 makes a number of recommendations with respect to PUP payments.<\/p><p> I have said at this committee before that one of the challenges faced by the  Department is to strike a balance between, on the one hand, designing and managing large-scale service processes that are reliable, efficient and effective for the overwhelming majority of people who use our services and, on the other, implementing controls and checks to assure payment and service integrity.  However, we are mindful in doing this that our primary purpose is to support people who need support and that we cannot pursue the elimination of error or fraud at the cost of unreasonably denying entitlement to service or frustrating access to that entitlement.  This is always a key consideration and never more so than when implementing the PUP.<\/p><p> Given the volume of claims to be processed, the level of public anxiety arising from the truly dystopian images we witnessed in other countries, the need to ensure people who lost employment due to Government-mandated measures were supported and the imperative to buttress public acceptance of those measures, I believe it was correct, when designing PUP within an incredibly short time period, to accept a higher level of risk and to favour prompt processing over very tight control.  That is not to say that there was no control.  In fact, there was a range of take-on and in-payment controls and while they may not have been as extensive as for normal jobseeker payments, their impact is reflected in the fact that about 500,000 of the claims processed were not awarded.  In addition, in-payment control reviews are associated with about a further 143,000 claim closures.<\/p><p> It is also notable that although the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report identifies control improvements that could be made, the gross level of overpayment estimated based on a sample of claims reviewed was 9.4%.  In making this estimate the report notes the Department&rsquo;s observation that the figure is arguably inflated by the inclusion in the sample of periods when there was a high level of churn on the scheme.  Excluding these periods, the estimated overpayment level would be about 6%, a figure consistent with data from the work we have since concluded in awarding accredited social insurance contributions.  These estimated figures need to be seen in the context where overpayment levels in welfare administrations, not just in Ireland but around the world, tend to average between 3% and 5%, with high churn schemes such as jobseeker payments having somewhat higher rates.<\/p><p> It would have been untenable to impose the normal level of control checks and frustrate prompt access to payments during the period of a global pandemic in order to achieve a marginal percentage reduction in overpayment levels.  It is also to be borne in mind that the Department can and will in the coming months review claims paid and, for example, using data matching with Revenue records, identify and pursue recovery of overpayments made.  Any overpayments made will of course be followed up in a reasonable and proportionate manner.  Having said this, I accept that the level of overpayment is material and that it is always possible to do better.  I accept the recommendations in the report are appropriate.  We have accepted them and I can confirm they are being actioned.<\/p><p> Chapter 10 reviews the approach to management of appeals and contains a number of recommendations.  By way of background, the appeals services, headed by the chief appeals officer, although part of the Department, has statutory independence in the performance of its functions.  Each year it receives and processes about 23,000 appeals, representing about 1.4% of all claims.  As part of the appeals process, it forwards all appeals received to the Department providing the Department with an opportunity to review the decision made based on the appeal submissions of the appellant.  Typically, about 20% of appeals result in revised decisions being made by the Department.  The balance fall to be determined by an appeals officer.<\/p><p> Overall, taking Department reviews and appeals decisions together, over 50% of appeals, or about 0.7% of first instance decisions, result in a favourable outcome for the appellant.  It is important in saying this to point out that the success rate varies by scheme and, generally speaking, the schemes with higher success rates tend to be schemes that rely on medical evidence as to a person&rsquo;s capacity for work or requirement for care.  While not the only factor at play, it is often the case that appellants submit additional medical information that was not available to the Department.  In order to address this issue, the Department has worked with advocacy groups to revise its application forms and new disability allowance and invalidity forms will be launched in the first half of 2022.<\/p><p> In terms of processing performance, the appeals process can be quasi-judicial in nature, with all parties to an appeal being provided with the opportunity to submit information and state their case.  This necessarily results in a lengthy process.  Nevertheless, increases in the number of appeals officers in recent years are now bearing some fruit and appeals processing times have improved.  The approach to considering appeals and in particular to interaction between the appeals office and the Department to reduce transaction times is also being reviewed.  It is hoped that this, together with the implementation of a new IT system starting in 2022, will lead to further improvements.  In addition, in order to improve overall management capacity within the office, including quality assurance recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Minister is bringing forward legislation in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill to enable the appointment of more than one deputy chief appeals officer.<\/p><p> I understand committee members have expressed an interest in discussing issues related to false self-employment and the contracting of public employment services.  Both of these topics were the subject of detailed discussion at this and other committees in recent years, including in response to reports presented by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>The issue of false self-employment was also the subject of a recent report by the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development and the Islands.  In order to assist the committee, I have provided additional material in response to questions submitted to the Department last week.  Rather than go into these matters further in this opening statement, I will be pleased to respond to any questions members may have.<\/p><p> I will conclude, as I have previously, by saying that we, as a Department, although we try to do our best, are not perfect and we do not always get things right.  We pride ourselves on being, and hope we are, open to challenge, criticism and suggestions for improvements.  The process today plays an important role in reminding us of our purpose and helping us to identify areas for improvement and learn from our mistakes. It is through such a process that we hope to improve.  I and my colleagues will be pleased to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639042200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The lead questioner for the committee today is Deputy McAuliffe, who will have 15 minutes.

We appreciate him being here.  I know he was feeling unwell.  There are three areas I wish to cover.  They can be divided into questions relating to what is a very unusual period and the PUP, and those that might be asked in a normal period.<\/p> <p>  I will focus first on non-compliant procurement.  I refer to the list of 92 contracts provided to the committee.  Almost all of those fall into what we might call the provision of local employment service contracts.  Many public representatives and members of the public will be quite surprised to learn that household names in their local constituency that provide valuable local employment services are considered by the Comptroller and Auditor General to have non-compliant procurement.  I suspect that is not a reflection on any of the services those organisations provide but, rather, the procurement process.  I ask Mr. McKeon to address why the Comptroller and Auditor General considers those contracts to be non-compliant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#D00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Certainly.  As a Department, we value local employment services.  I am very aware of and sensitive to the uncertainty the local employment services are currently experiencing.  The situation arises on foot of legal advice the Department received several years ago from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.   That advice was subsequently confirmed by the Attorney General.  We did query it.  Senator Higgins previously provided material and we had that material queried as well.  The clear and unambiguous legal advice is that the process that commenced more than 25 years ago of awarding annual contracts without a competitive procurement process is not compliant with EU procurement rules.  In spite of what some people may think, that is not necessarily advice that we particularly welcomed, but it is the advice we received and we have to respect it and act on it.  As Accounting Officer, I have to make sure I act on it because my statutory function is to try to ensure our procurement is legal.  That is the background to it.  I do not want to make too big a deal out of this but, even leaving aside the legal advice, renewing or rolling over contracts for 25 years without any kind of competitive process is not exactly good governance.  You do get into the classic governance principle in respect of relationships.  The Minister put her position on this issue on the record very clearly in the D&aacute;il last week.

It reflects what Senator Higgins previously brought to our attention, and that certainly was discussed with the legal advisers.  The view is that the situation is clear.  There are a couple of points I wish to make on it.  I do not want to get into the detail of what I understand it to be, partly because I am outside the curtilage of Leinster House.  Just because a service is social in nature does not mean it is not also of financial or economic interest.  Those are the two streams within the EU procurement rules.  In a situation where there are other providers available in the market - this is not just the Irish market; it is the EU market - that could provide similar services, then the services have to be tendered.

I do not wish to discuss the contract, but does Mr. McKeon agree that the conditions of any new contract are decisions of the Department and that, in directing it to have compliant procurement, the Comptroller and Auditor General is not instructing the Department in any way in respect of the issues I have mentioned, such as lot sizes, the number of lots and the conditions of the contracts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#D00700","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I will come to that.

We commissioned Indecon to prepare two reports on local employment services and jobs clubs.  We then commissioned the Institute of Economic Studies and Social Finance International to carry out another study.   They have all come to the conclusion, for good reasons, that there is an opportunity in the procurement to deliver a more integrated service.  That is what it is really about.  It is in the interests of jobseekers.  At the moment, across the various job club and local employment services, we have approximately 66 different providers.  We also have JobPath providers and our own service.  It is a bit of a confused landscape for jobseekers.  The advice we got clearly in all those reports was to try to bring it together and integrate it.  The other advice we got that the different services such as ourselves as Intreo, JobPath, the local employment services and job clubs are all broadly involved across different cohorts of jobseekers.  The advice we got was to try to focus each different service provision on particular cohorts.

I will give an example.  In Donegal, which, as the Deputy is aware, is one of the four regions where we tried it out and are taking the lessons from that, the Donegal and Inishowen providers came together to put in a collaborative bid.  A similar situation pertained in Sligo and Leitrim.  Although it is one lot where there were previously two providers, the two providers are still involved in Donegal and in Sligo and Leitrim.

The difficulty many people in the sector and many people committed to the principle of partnership see is that as we continue to treat each of these policy tools and their administration as services, it restricts the ability of local communities to come together in partnership to respond to local needs.  Mr. McKeon said this is a contract that goes back 25 years.  Communities like mine in Ballymun and Finglas and many others had pockets of disadvantage and still have, and many of the partnerships were established to bring agencies together to move away from a national focus to allow a local response.  The difficulty with the SICAP being tendered as a contract, the local employment services being tendered as a single contract and the T&uacute;s scheme and community employment scheme being more under the control of the Department is that they make sense if we were replying to the Comptroller and Auditor General and analysing this as an accounting exercise but they remove the local focus.  For example, if there was a significant job loss in Dublin Port, the local employment service that covers the north inner city would be equipped to handle that and to put in place local solutions.  Equally, the same would apply if there was a significant drop in employment, as happened in Ballymun in 2010 and 2011 where we did not have many of the new unemployed that many of the other services had but rather had people who had been successfully placed in employment who then returned to the services and those people required a different response from, for example, people in Glasnevin and Drumcondra who might have been experiencing unemployment for the first time.  If we move from a local to regional approach we remove the local focus and the ability of local communities to respond.  This is about bringing all the stakeholders in an area together.  Many people are asking whether the Department is committed to the principle of partnership in the way it would have championed it in the mid-1990s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#E00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>In response to a few of those points, I would make the point I just made.  The Indecon report and the study carried out by the Institute of Economic Studies and Social Finance Foundation recommended that it be done in 15 lots.  One of my colleagues might correct me if I am wrong on that as I do not have the papers in front of me.  We are going with considerably more than that.  We have not finalised it but it will be considerably more than that.  It will be a regional approach but not regional in the sense of it being at that level because we have taken on board the feedback.<\/p> <p>  The existing providers, which are sitting tenants, so to speak, are well positioned.  There is no reason they cannot get together, as they did in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, and be successful in this process and when they are successful they will be on the ground and can respond locally.  I take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s point about when something happens.  The loss of jobs for the Debenhams workers was another case in point last year.  The Department often takes the lead and organises in such cases.  If the Deputy were to speak to SIPTU officials, they would be very positive about the way the Department engaged and worked not only with its staff but with local employment service and other service providers.  The Department will continue to co-ordinate and support in that respect.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the Department championing partnership, we like partnership but we have to operate within the rules.

Some 411 claims were processed, of which 329 were employees and 82 were self-employed.  While the irregular payments made to employees was approximately 9%, which is a little but not substantially higher than the irregular payments under other schemes, it is interesting it was not possible for the 82% or 100% of those who were self-employed to identify whether they were eligible.  In short time Mr. McKeon has available to respond to me and other speakers, will he outline why the measures adopted in August were not adopted earlier and whether that was even possible?  Why did the Department not make better use of the data made available by the Revenue Commissioners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#E00600","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Briefly, real-time data information is made available in respect of employees by the Revenue Commissioners and I will return to that point.

We will go back and review all self-employed claims against those records to identify overpayments.  We have approximately 200 staff who are currently engaged on maintaining the PUP.  The detail may be online but a great deal of manual processing is involved.  As the scheme transitions, we will keep those staff in place and they will be involved in a control project to identify overpayments that happen.  We will follow up on those and pay particular attention to the self- employed group.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the employee group, there were some difficulties at the start of the process using the real-time look-up information facility in the way it was suggested, which is the way we are using it now.  The first issue was that IT system we developed, which we did in four days, did not have direct links to Revenue, which it could not have had.  We subsequently rebuilt it on our core platforms and that took a period of time.  The second issue was that the real-time look-up agreement we had with Revenue prior to the pandemic was a single case by case look-up facility for data minimisation reasons.  An officer had to manually type in a PPSN and get feedback on it.  There was no mass or batch look-up facility.  We had to put in place a new data sharing agreement with Revenue.  The third constraint with our getting to grips with it was that it was a relatively new system at that stage.  The terms and conditions for being eligible for the PUP was that a person had to be unemployed in the week prior to 13 March as the scheme was rolled out.  When employers submit returns even with the real-time information facility, let me put it this way, they are not necessarily 100% accurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1639042200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Mr. McKeon might wrap up his comments in response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#E00800","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>It will only take me a few seconds to respond to this last element.

As I said, we did not do that.  What the Department did - this is going back to the 1990s, long before my time - was to have a look at a number of cases to try to determine what criteria could be used, applying the common law handed down by the courts, to classify somebody as employed or self-employed.

If the Deputy wants to say we took a test case to establish the criteria, then that is what we did, but those criteria are applied individually to each worker.<\/p> <p>  The chief appeals officer can probably comment on this.  On rare occasions, particularly in the appeals space, if all the employees and an employer agree to have a group of workers who are in a similar position with the same employer, evaluated based on taking a sample, that may happen, but it is very rare.  All the individual workers have to agree, the employer has to agree and each worker gets a separate, independent determination, which he or she can then appeal.  That is not the same as people saying one can do a test case and what comes out of that case determines all subsequent cases.  That is not what happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#F03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1639042200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Can Mr. McKeon give other examples, such as in media or construction, where one Scope determination has given rise to the classification of a sector, as was the case with the courier sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#F03100","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>No, I cannot but that has not happened with the courier sector.

One of the concerns raised by some of the people working in the area is that someone working in the service for more than 20 years might be on a high salary scale while another group tendering might have people with two or three years' experience who would be on a lower pay grade.  How will this be dealt with when processing applications?  Will Mr. McKeon outline what are the consequences for not following the legal advice?

When we received the advice we did not rush into it.  We took a very slow and deliberate approach.   There were three separate independent consultant reports.  In all cases the consultants engaged with local employment services.  The Department has had 140 separate engagements with the sector over this period, including meetings with every chief executive of every local employment service and every job club and dealings with unions.  There has been quite a lot of engagement and I will detail some of it.  All of the CEOs of the local development companies were briefed in 2018 on what we were doing and what had to happen.  In 2019, Indecon briefed all of the local employment services and job clubs together with the Department.  All of the local employment services and job clubs were visited by the Department individually in 2019.  The Institute of Employment Studies consulted with all of them in 2020.  The Minister and the Department meet representatives of the Irish Local Development Network regularly.  With regard to the trade unions, we have had six meetings with them going back as far as 2019.  On 9 November, we held a detailed briefing session on the outcome of the first phase of the tender and sought feedback on the design of the next phase.  There has been quite extensive consultation.  I know one of the issues, and this is not just with regard to local employment services, is that sometimes people say we were there but we did not listen to them.  There is a limit to what we can change as a consequence.  We have listened and we try to take on board all of the feedback we can, to the extent that we can within the law.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question on what would happen if we did not do it, the Government cannot knowingly break the law.  I will put it that way.  Once we know it we cannot unknow it.  The Government could not knowingly break the law.  The Government is meant to stand up and apply the law.  I do not think that is an option.  We would be open to suit by other potential providers.  The European Commission could take enforcement proceedings of its own volition.  There would be quite serious consequences.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point made on the various pay rates, various providers and various costs, after careful deliberation we have taken an approach in our tender that the marks for price are as low as we can make them.  Normally, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform can confirm this, the marks awarded in any tender process for price are typically 40% or even higher in some cases.  In the tenders we issued in the four phases where we did the first phase recruitment, price accounted for 25%.  Service quality and, in particular, community and social connections accounted for the remaining 75%.  A lot of the marks are awarded to recognise exactly the point the Deputy has made on the value of experience in social connections.  We prize the marks towards these.  Many of the providers have been described as moving towards a profit-based model.  Other providers that are entitled to compete will compete, and if they get through the process they will be awarded fairly.  If we think about it logically, if some providers have to add a profit margin on top of their costs while others do not so there is some equalisation there.  We cannot release the report of the Institute of Employment Studies in full because it gives us its views on what appropriate costs would be.  We have set a minimum price, which is very rare, below which any tender is not accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1639042200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I want to move on to another issue, which is social welfare appeals and disability regarding people who have worked and who have been self-employed.  There is a particular case I want to highlight as an issue.  A person has been diagnosed with MS and can no longer work.  I have been dealing with the Department on this case for more than 12 months.  The issue is that the person has a mortgage of &euro;1,000 a month.  In order for this to be paid the person has let out rooms.  All of the rent is going towards the mortgage but the Department is treating it as income.  The person is now in receipt of &euro;50 per week.  Everyone knows MS is not an easy condition to manage.  I am surprised by the way the Department is assessing it and not taking into account the mortgage.  This person would not qualify for a local authority house.  If the person sells the house and goes on the market to rent it would cost &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,400 a month.  The person has been very careful about managing these affairs but the Department is taking the rent for the letting of rooms as an income.  People who are working and earning &euro;50,000 a year and earning &euro;14,000 from letting rooms would not be taxed on it.

However, I want to say that for our observers because we are about to discuss fraud which can get the headlines.  In reality, the overwhelming majority of people who use this are absolutely entitled to payment and it is a valid payment.  We must always balance trying to control against fraud and overpayments due to our own error against not frustrating people's entitlement.  It will never be got right.  Especially with the pandemic unemployment payment, if that balance had to be tipped one way or the other, our judgment was to tip it towards the presumption of honesty rather than dishonesty.  That is how we would generally try to operate anyway.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the level of incorrect payment, if I could call it that, our own estimate, which may change, is that it is approximately 6%.  This information was not available to the Comptroller and Auditor General when his team was in but the Deputy will be aware the Government took a decision to give full contributions, rather than credited contributions, to people who were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  We have done an exercise, using the Revenue records and our own records, of matching when people were on PUP and when they were in employment and then filling in the gaps.  From that, it looks like the figure is approximately 6%.<\/p> <p>  The question is how much of that is fraud and how much of it is for some other reason.  When the pandemic unemployment payment was introduced, there was no social insurance conditionality to it.  We spoke to the Minister at the time, and the Deputy may remember there were certain sectors of the economy which were very concerned that they were excluded, such as those in the informal economy who would normally go to our community welfare service but because of social distancing, restrictions and so on, they could not have access to that in the normal way.<\/p> <p>  Sex workers would be one such group.  There were religious confraternities as well, across Christian and non-Christian faiths, such as mendicant orders which would not have been social insurance contributors and suddenly had no weekly collection and were on their uppers.  In those situations, our choice was to tell them they should not be travelling and our offices were closed or to give them the payment.  A decision was taken to give them the payment and then subsequently go back over it.  There were those kind of cases, which are not fraud.  They may be irregular payments but they are not fraud.<\/p> <p>  The other issue the Deputy was raised was self-employment.  Self-employment is a difficulty because the returns are made annually and when they are made they are made on a whole-year basis.  The Revenue returns are, therefore, for the entire year, rather than week by week throughout the year.  We are setting up a project to do this, as recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have to look and compare the income of the people who declared themselves as self-employed for the 2019 year and for the 2020 year and make an assessment as to which of those it looks as though their income was sustained, even though they were claiming the PUP and go back and review each of those cases on an individual basis.  That is what we intend to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1639042200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>That was part of the difficulty with trying to establish that in terms of people in the informal economy, such as taxi drivers and others who were working in a self-employed capacity but not necessarily every week and did not have the same visibility of their work as others, being assessed differently.

I have had extensive engagement with local employment services, which have helped thousands of people find gainful employment since the 1990s.  They are basically left with two choices.  They can either tender to be part of the future arrangements or they can choose not to tender.  There are a number of factors involved in making those choices.  The new scheme, Pathways to Work, sets impossible timelines.  Even though the Minister tells me there was extensive engagement with stakeholders in developing the document, if the local employment services that currently deliver these programmes, which have local knowledge and experience, say the timelines are impossible, I have to question how they came about.  They say they cannot provide the service within their budget because the whole service is front-loaded.  That makes it financially unsustainable for the existing local employment services to tender.  This means all of their staff will be made redundant.  I presume the Secretary General has heard the term \"stuck between a rock and a hard place\".  That is where the employees in the local employment services, LESs, find themselves.<\/p> <p>  The new scheme allows for a maximum of 438 clients per year for the entire county of Wexford.  Some 1,350 people availed of the services of the LES in the county in the last year.  That does not include walk-ins.  The Department's proposal is to reduce that number by 900.  That is very concerning.  How was that figure arrived at?<\/p> <p>  Where will the LES workers find themselves in the case of redundancy?  How does the Department propose to deal with their future?  Will they be made redundant or employed by the successful tenderer?  Will there be a transfer of undertakings and so on for existing employees of the LESs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#L00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I will mention a couple of things.  With regard to the timelines, there has been extensive consultation.  I will not go back into that because I am conscious of time but this has been in the offing for quite a few years now.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right.  The existing providers of local employment services will have a choice as to whether to tender.  I hope they all will and that they will collaborate in doing so.  They are the sitting tenants and are well positioned.  There may be competition from other providers and it will be an open and fair competition but the existing providers are well positioned.  With regard to the evidence for this, as I have said, the approach we took was to start tendering in four areas where there was not currently a local employment service.  In two out of the three areas for which they tendered, the partnerships, the local development companies, were successful, so I believe they can succeed.<\/p><p>We will be giving an extended tender period to enable all providers to put together a good tender response and to enable them to figure out collaboration locally.<\/p><p> The numbers who will be referred to the service are ultimately determined by the number of people who are unemployed.

A person with no earnings would get the full payment, a person with some earnings might get a reduced payment and so on.

The pandemic has naturally increased the amount of support that people have needed and it was correct for the Government to provide as many supports as possible.

An issue has been flagged with me by people a number of times and it would be no harm for Mr. McKeon to put the matter to bed today.  It has to do with people leaving the country who were in receipt of the PUP and other payments.  Has Mr. McKeon detailed information on this matter?  It would be no harm to get an insight into it.

Last year, the Department reported &euro;99 million in overpayments, of which approximately &euro;20 million related to fraud.  To put that in context, it was a year with in or around &euro;30 billion in payments.  In the year to date, we are estimating that there has been &euro;102 million in overpayments, of which &euro;16 million relates to fraud.  I do not want to overstate the level of fraud.  So far, we have raised debts of between &euro;20 million and &euro;25 million in terms of the PUP and have recovered &euro;10 million to &euro;11 million of that.  We have yet to implement some of the measures that we indicated we would and that the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to whereby we would review all of the claims and payments and try to match instances where people were working while also claiming PUP.  Many of those instances would be genuine and not fraudulent.  One of the issues that we as a Department need to face is that, under the law, people are meant to sign off a payment the first day they return to work.  Often, though, they do not get their first pay cheques for four weeks.  In the past, they may have sought the supplementary welfare allowance for that period.  In such situations where there is a detected level of fraud because people are working and claiming, we must net off the amount they would have got from the supplementary welfare payment.  This is something to be aware of.<\/p> <p>  I am afraid that we do not have figures on the international dimension.  To a certain extent, it is a case of us not knowing what we do not know.

It does not reassure me that because they have been contracted out in the past, we will do it again in terms of the interaction claimants and people who are on welfare have.  I have direct experience with my own local employment service, which I have found very good and pretty much centred on the individual.  I have seen people ending up in work which is what we all want to achieve as a consequence of that kind of one-to-one interaction.  I share Deputy McAuliffe's concerns about that local dimension being lost with what is happening.  There is a potential loss of some of the practices that have built up over the years.

What we are trying to do is secure exactly what the Deputy mentioned in terms of that local and community linkage.  I am optimistic that we will do so.  I point to the experience of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, where very similar concerns were expressed in 2014.  We have shown what can be done.

An interesting report was done by Michael McGann of Maynooth University of a street level bureaucrat view.  I think it was funded by the OECD or the European Commission.  What he found was that there are definite differences in terms of attitude and values between JobPath and local employment services, but they are not very significant.  In fact, some of them might be in the reverse direction from what one might expect.  While I do not want to put words in his mouth, I think the overall conclusion, if I remember, was that it has not resulted in the type of experience that people thought it might, based on, for example, the experience in the UK.  I say to the Deputy that she should have a look at the data and have a look at the results.  I think it has been a reasonably good service.  We are changing it.

It dealt with many of the points the Deputy raised.<\/p><p>It points out, as I pointed out earlier, that under law, the Department makes decisions about employment status for social insurance purposes.  We make those decisions independently of Revenue.  Revenue makes decisions in respect of tax, which are made independently of us.  The Workplace Relations Commission makes decisions in respect of employment rights, which are also made independently.  The report from the other committee recommended that it should be centralised in one body, which would be the Workplace Relations Commission.

I am aware that this is disputed.  From my experience, direct inquiries and direct discussions with people in the Department, we make decisions based on individuals.  Individuals are assessed for social insurance purposes based on the circumstances of their particular case.  We use criteria which are set out in the code of conduct for the determination of employment status, which we developed jointly with Ibec, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Revenue, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court in the early 2000s.

It said it was the fault of the Department of Social Protection because of the test cases and the poor criteria set out.  The Department of Social Protection said there were no test cases, then there were test cases.  A letter in the Department's correspondence to the Committee of Public Accounts from Mr. McKeon's predecessor states that test cases were selected for detailed investigation.  This process resulted in a decision by the appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office on 12 June 1995, who decided that a courier was self-employed if he provided his own vehicle and equipment, was responsible for all expenses, including tax and insurance and payment was made on the basis of rate per job plus mileage and allowance.  It went on to say that the appeal officer's decision established the criteria in relation to the employment status of couriers that has since been generally accepted throughout the industry and also by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  That coincides with what the Revenue Commissioners told us last week, that it was a single precedent set by the Department of Social Protection that led to all couriers being deemed to be self-employed.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I am deeply unsatisfied with the responses from both bodies.  The only step we can take now is to commission an independent investigation into the background to this deal.  I am sure the Secretary General of the Department would support that.  Would his Department agree to commission an independent investigation from someone outside the State?

I copied that to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the time.  However, it was decided to accept that risk, given the greater good of supporting people during what was an unprecedented time.  At this point, all payments of the pandemic unemployment payment are checked against the Revenue Commissioners, both at claim stage and during an ongoing payment stage.  Throughout the past year and bit, or 21 months, we have undertaken a number of control activities.  Our special investigations unit has undertaken a number of control reviews.  We have run certification programmes and projects.  We have had the employer reporting line and we have had recertification.  As a consequence of those checks, we stopped approximately 140,000 claims in payment.  On the take on checks, we received approximately 1.8 million claims and we only paid 1.3 million claims.  To give people reassurance, there was already a check there.  On the next steps, as I said, our staff are currently supporting this system and the scheme.  They will be diverted to review all claims that were paid to see if there were any overlaps between payment and employment, particularly on the self-employment side.

Correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department in 2000 shows that there was a test case.  In that correspondence, the Secretary General of the Department of Social Welfare, as it was then called in 2000, said that in order to resolve the matter, a number of representative test cases were selected in 1993 and 1994 for detailed investigation and that the process resulted in a decision by an appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office on 12 June 1996, who decided that a courier was self-employed.  He went on to outline three grounds.  The chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners in August of the same year stated, &ldquo;I enclose copies of our letters of 7 March 1997 and 3 April 1997 to Messers K. Ryan and company\".  They represented courier firms at the discussions in the Gresham Hotel.  The letters outlined the agreement reached for tax purposes.  They state that for the purpose of insurability under social welfare law a motorcycle courier was found to be self-employed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs tribunal some years ago and that the decision was not challenged further through the High Court on a point of law and consequently would stand for social insurance purposes.<\/p> <p>  A number of factors were set out.  The Chief State Solicitor at the time, Mr. Mark Connaughton, said the classification, or certain issues that would identify somebody as being self-employed \"cannot of itself justify a conclusion that the claimant [the courier in this case] is in business on his own account\". <\/p> <p>  In 2021, the current code of practice states that &ldquo;the provision of tools or equipment will not have a significant bearing on reaching a conclusion about which employment status is appropriate&rdquo;.  That is a change.  That is the reason I read out the 2021 code of practice.  I do not want to hammer home the point or anything, but it is clear in the number of direct quotations and correspondence that we have seen to date, that a deal was done to classify couriers as a group.  In the documents even for this meeting today, it is clear that the Department moved away from that practice approximately three or four years ago.  If I recall correctly, last year there were only three companies using that.  Now there are two companies using that, according to correspondence from the Department.  Is it correct that there has been a move away from that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#T00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639042200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>None of that, in terms of interpretation of it, is reflective of the practice.  The Chair is quoting correspondence to me dating back 21 years, from a time when I was not even in the Department.  That was a long time ago.  For as long as I have been in the Department, which is since 2010, a person got their social insurance status, as required by law, based on the circumstances of their particular case, and I have been assured by my predecessors that that has always been the practice.<\/p> <p>  The Chair's first quote identified a number of criteria.  As I said, part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the early noughties resulted in the code of conduct for determination of employment and self-employment status.  That identified five criteria.  If memory serves me well, the line about ownership of tools and so on was in that code of conduct.  I am not 100% certain of that but I am pretty sure it was.  It is, therefore, not a move.  I am not aware of any deal that people are talking about.  If somebody could show me the deal, I would be interested to see it.  I am not aware of any deal.

The concern is that this practice would then be taken up in other sectors, such as construction.  I do not want that to take up this morning.  The point here is that it is clear from the documentation we have seen in the past year that there was a deal in operation and that it did operate.  It was scaled down in more recent years to the point where it is nearly non-existent now but, for a 20-year period, it did operate in a way that meant there would have been workers misclassified under that deal.  We know from the courier sector that not everybody wanted to be categorised as self-employed.  Some people who were doing it did not even know they were self-employed.<\/p> <p>  There are two problems.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 922B is correspondence from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, with whom we engaged this morning.  It is dated 25 November this year and provides information requested by the committee regarding the Department's investigations into contractors engaged by RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General states that due to the scale of the investigation, it is not possible to provide a specific timeline for its completion but it could continue into 2023.  While the Department is receiving good co-operation from RT&Eacute;, this investigation is being conducted alongside all other employment status investigations in other sectors.  The Secretary General goes on to detail the appeals process for such investigations.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item of correspondence?  Agreed.<\/p><p>This has been flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I do not want to retrace this morning's steps but we followed up on the issue with Mr. McKeon and there are a number of questions there.  I suggest that we write to the Secretary General and ask to be kept informed of developments with that investigation.  It is a serious matter.  It seems to be of significant scale.  He refers in the letter to the scale of the investigation, so it is presumably very widespread or large.

Agreed. <\/p><p> No. 927B is also from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection.

This and the next five items of correspondence are examples of responses to the requests we issue to bodies where the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to material instances of non-compliant procurement.  In 2020, the Department of Social Protection did not comply with procurement guidelines in relation to 92 contracts.  The Secretary General has asked that due to the commercial sensitivity of the contract value information it be treated in confidence so I ask members to bear that in mind.  We will note and publish this item, which was flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.<\/p><p> No. 932B is correspondence from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice, dated 29 November 2021, also providing information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement.  The explanations provided in relation to the Prison Service&rsquo;s non-compliant procurement are less informative.  While I welcome the fact that contracts are now in place in 11 of the 16 cases referred to, it is proposed to request further details on the reasons for each instance of non-compliance with procurement guidelines in the Prison Service.  This item was also flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy but I do not think she is present.<\/p><p> No. 937B is from Ms Jacqui McCrum, Secretary General of the Department of Defence, dated 29 November 2021.  It is a detailed response to the committee&rsquo;s request for information on non-compliant procurement.  It is proposed to note and publish this item. Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This item was flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  There is a short letter and a table giving more details.<\/p><p> No. 939B is from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, dated 29 November 2021.  The non-compliant procurement for the Department in 2020 totalled over &euro;91 million.  With the exception of two, this concerned contracts that moved to the Department as part of the transfer of functions from the Department of Justice that occurred in 2020.  All 151 of these contracts related to the provision of accommodation services for international protection applicants.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item?  It was flagged for discussion by Deputy Matt Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120900002#Z01000","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639042200,"counter":385,"content":"<p>This is a point of particular interest as it relates to contracts pertaining to direct provision that were transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  According to the Secretary General, Mr. Fergal Lynch, the previous Department, namely, the Department of Justice, had a view that the contracts were competitive and not applicable for inclusion in the return under circular 40\/2002, but this Accounting Officer took a different view.  This indicates a difference in interpretation across the board, given that one Department can take a diametrically different view from another about the same contract, and it therefore raises broader questions about different contracts.  Could Mr. McCarthy comment on whether there are varying levels of compliance issues across Departments?  This correspondence affirms that there is a subjective view to all of this.<\/p> <p>  The committee should accept the offer of a more detailed breakdown being provided on a confidential basis.  That would be useful to our deliberations.  We are going to be discussing the report on direct provision, following on from our consideration of the Department of Justice's report.

They are not the standard thing.  If they related to a more direct procurement of goods and services, it would be clearer as to whether the procurement was compliant or non-compliant.  The previous Department, which was the Department of Justice, considered that the procurement was compliant on the basis that the requirement for the accommodation for asylum seekers had been publicly advertised in national and local newspapers but the new Accounting Officer re-examined the matter.  I do not know whether he took legal advice on it but he certainly formed the view that it was not compliant.  When I reported previously on this, I drew attention to the fact that it was not competitively procured.  That was about four or five years ago.  There was some advertising after that and we had a discussion with the Department of Justice at the time on whether it was a compliant procurement.  There is certainly an arguable case, although this is probably a more difficult one to call than many others.

No. 947C is from a PhD candidate with the Royal College of Surgeons and dated 1 December 2021.

The correspondence states the evidence is that the receipt of pharmaceutical company payments is associated with higher prescribing rates, higher prescribing costs and lower prescribing quality.<\/p> <p>  Given that public funds are expended on prescription medication, it is important that robust and effective governance arrangements be in place.

The issue is the negative influence in respect of the prescribing of medication.  Undue influence could be exerted by big pharmaceutical companies, which have a lot of clout, to promote a particular brand or quantity of a drug.  That is of concern.

It is a bigger thing to make an allegation of bias as a result of that because there are identifiable doctors on a website mentioned in the article who receive funding.  It could be in the form of sponsorship for events, research funding and so on.  It would be impossible to conclude that every doctor who receives such funding would be compromised or that it would have negatively affected their prescribing.

During this time, I have been privileged to have worked with the families of the disappeared - those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried as a result of the Troubles.  The experience of having a loved one disappeared has been harrowing for the families.  They have faced many challenges since the abductions and, above all, their wish is to see their loved ones brought home for a Christian burial.  I am delighted today to be accompanied by several of the families.  I am accompanied by Maria Lynskey, whose uncle, Joe Lynskey, was disappeared in August 1972 and whose body has not been recovered.  I am also joined by Dympna Kerr and Oliver McVeigh, whose brother, Columba McVeigh, was abducted from Dublin in October 1975.  It is believed he was brought to Bragan bog, County Monaghan and despite searches there by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains, ICLVR, he sadly has not as yet been recovered.  We are also joined by Anne Morgan, the sister of Seamus Ruddy.  Seamus was disappeared in France in 1985.  His body was recovered in May 2017 following a number of searches.  Finally, we are joined by Michael McConville.<\/p><p>His mother, Jean, disappeared in 1972 and she was recovered in August 2003.  <br\/><br\/>One of the most powerful aspects of the work with the families of the disappeared is the solidarity of the families in supporting each other.  Even when their own loved ones have been found they continue to support those who still wait and still yearn.  I am going to hand over to the families shortly but before I do I will make some general comments on legacy due to the current situation in which many individuals bereaved and-or injured find themselves in today.<br\/><br\/>One of the most challenging issues currently affecting those bereaved is the question of legacy and the direction of travel of the British Government.  This has retraumatised, it has brought heartache to families and it has raised key issues around worth.  For example, why is my loved one's death not being addressed, why is the state saying that his or her death no longer matters, and why are they telling those who perpetrated my loss that they are no longer of interest to the state?<br\/><br\/>Over my time in WAVE, I have engaged with families whose loved one's deaths were being investigated by the RUC, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Ombudsman, the legacy unit in PSNI and specialist investigative teams such as Operation Kenova.  It is important to state what the bereaved have been asked to make concessions in support of the Good Friday Agreement, including the early release of prisoners; a limit to a two-year sentence; and an <i>ad hoc<\/i>process to address the legacy of the past.  It is clear that at times the priorities that were adopted in legacy were politically driven.  Now, once again, there is a proposal that the bereaved will have to make concessions again if this goes through.  The effect on those bereaved has been colossal.  Many have spoken about feeling that they have been rewounded and that their loved ones have died all over again.  The expected direction of travel is both morally and ethically wrong.<br\/><br\/>Legacy can be addressed.  We have seen that in our work with families engaging with the Operation Kenova that is led by Jon Boutcher.  The Secretary of State keeps stating that there is no alternative to the statue of limitations but that is simply untrue.  There is an alternative but the Tory Government needs to find a process that provides an amnesty and protections for a number of soldiers, and refuse to accept the processes that work today for families.  We need the international community to stand with us on this.  The US Administration was a firm supporter of the peace process.  The Irish Government also needs to hold firm.  I urge all members to fully address the deaths that also happened in their jurisdiction.  It would be beneficial if a legacy process operated across Ireland given the cross-jurisdictional issues that arise.<br\/><br\/>The second point I want noted today is support for the injured.  The injured pension has been made available for those who were injured in the Troubles who live within the United Kingdom.  Those who were injured in the South of Ireland but who are not UK citizens are not eligible to apply.  We urge the Irish Government to address this issue and ensure parity.<br\/><br\/>I will return to the issue of the disappeared and why we are here today.  Disappearing individuals is quite simply one of the cruelest acts anyone can commit against families.  It is  the families who continue to suffer, yearning and longing for the return of their loved one&rsquo;s bodies each day.<br\/><br\/>The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains, ICLVR, appeared before this committee a month ago.  The commission does sterling work and its people are amazing.  However, the ICLVR relies on information.  We urge anyone who has the information regarding the whereabouts of any of the disappeared to provide it to the ICLVR through the channels available or go to someone they trust so that the information can be passed on.<br\/><br\/>The ICLVR and the parameters around its work is one of the success stories of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is one of the processes that has worked.  However, it is information led and that is what is required.  The ICLVR has the specialists, equipment and funding but need information.  The families of Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh, Robert Nairac and Lisa Dorrian need to be able to bury their loved ones and lay them to rest.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of all of us, I thank the members of the committee for inviting us to join them this afternoon.  I am now going to hand over to the families.  First, Ms Lynskey will say a few words and she will be followed by Ms Kerr, Mr. McVeigh, Ms Morgan, and Mr. McConville.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Peake for her very important address and the sentiments she has expressed.

We talk about parties who can help, and the committee can help.  We appreciate every bit of help but it all leads back to one party and one group, that is, Sinn F&eacute;in, the provisional movement and the republican movement, who can garner this information and make an effort to get it.  Talk is cheap and we can talk all day but we do not need talk.  We need actions.  It needs to be brought to the highest possible level in Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p> <p>  It is never spoken about by Deputy McDonald in the D&aacute;il.  I never hear it mentioned and have never heard any reports.  A question was put to the deputy First Minister during time with Justin McNulty from the SDLP and she fudged it.  She probably knows me personally but fudged the question and did not want to answer it.  She talked about it in a roundabout way.  It has never, I presume, been brought up at the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis.  If it is such a blight on their future and on the past, why can they not go to the efforts to make sure all the disappeared are found and get it out of their hair?  We will not stop until we find the other bodies.  We just want a Christian burial.  We want to bring them home and bury them like everybody else has the right to do.<\/p> <p>  I urge members to keep pressure on the right people.  The information that comes through, if there is any, from when I have been talking to the commission members on and off is that they need direct involvement with the people giving information rather than through an interlocutor, which is what is happening.  That is like Chinese whispers.  I tell someone and someone tells someone else.  They will come on quicker and better with information if they get it directly from the people.  These people have nothing to fear.  They can be totally anonymous.  We do not need or want to know them.  If the bodies are found, we will be the first people to thank them.  That might sound silly, but we will be the first people to thank them.

I am a sister of Seamus Ruddy.  Seamus had been disappeared in France in 1985.  We waited 32 years before we found out where he was.  On 6 May 2017, I was in France and Seamus's body was found.<\/p><p>His remains were in a forest.  We had been to the location on two previous occasions.<\/p><p> Since the forensic team was put in place in 2005, we had a more professional way of searching for the disappeared.  When I came home after the 2008 search, when his body was not discovered, I knew that, in forensic terms, the team had done so much to try to find him.  I came away content in one respect because I knew the team members had forensically searched for him, but to no avail.  They were very close when they searched in 2008.  They were only three feet or four feet away from him when they finished their search.  The search in France lasted four days.  We did not have a very long time to look for him because there were many technical issues in the context of the French authorities.  On our last search in 2017, the whole team came over.  All the men and excavators were there.  We had a sniffer dog and as much forensic equipment as we needed to find him.  On Saturday, 6 May 2017, he was found.<\/p><p> In one way, it is very bittersweet because you are celebrating the death of a person, which is very unusual, and also celebrating that he has been found.  My heart goes out to the families who are still waiting because I know what it is like to get word that the remains had been found and he was on his way home.  That is what happened.  He returned to Ireland and was buried with my mother and father.<\/p><p> What is important is that while I was trying to get information, I spoke to men who were not directly involved in his killing but who were in the organisation that killed him, namely, the INLA.  I contacted them directly, went to meetings with them, discussed what I knew about it and they told me what they knew.  I found that aspect extremely beneficial.  I could look straight into their eyes and say \"Please help me\".  I knew then that those men would help me, and that is what they did.  They put their heart and soul into it.  That process went on for about two years.  I met them here in Newry - out in the open in the lobby of a local hotel.  It was not a private meeting or anything.  That helped me an awful lot because I knew those men would try their best and that is what they did.  Direct contact with those who may have been involved or who were around at the time or who knew people who were around at the time would bring this forward.  Initially, there was a reluctance on the part of the people to whom I was talking to engage with the commission.  If contact could be made through another type of intermediary so that people could talk to them, that could benefit the families.<\/p><p> It has been great to be able to go to the grave and know that he is in it.  For the first few months after finding him, I used to go to the graveyard.  I was very worried because I thought that someone would take him away.  It sounds a bit daft, but I was under the illusion that I might lose him again.  Having spent 32 years trying to find him, I did not want that to happen.  I tried my best anyway.  He is here and I am only getting used to that now.  It is a slow process accepting that I have now found him.  The work of the commission has helped me a million times over.  Its cost does not even get close to the price you would put on what it does.  I do not believe it has a price.<\/p><p> The Irish Government has stood by the families of the disappeared.  It has looked after us.  It is the one we should be congratulating and letting know that we have benefited.  The other families that are still waiting will benefit from this.  We just have to keep on asking for information.  By coming to this committee, it means that we are keeping this part of the Good Friday Agreement alive.

Those contributions have been very emotional for me to have heard for the first time at this committee.  I cannot begin to understand the pain and trauma that they and many families have had to endure over the years.  Of course, the pain and suffering are further compounded by the fact that they have not been able to locate the bodies of their loved ones in three of those cases - four including Lisa Dorrian.  The issue of those who were abducted and secretly buried is a terrible legacy of the conflict.  This generation of republicans are trying to undo the wrong that was done.  As a result, 13 of the 16 people killed by republicans have been recovered.  However, as we know, there are three remains that still have not been recovered, including Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac, as well as Lisa Dorrian.  I would use the platform of this committee to urge anyone out there who has any information to bring that forward and make it known.  That would be the consensus of everyone in the committee today.  If anyone has information they should come forward and make sure it is known.<\/p> <p>  I also take this opportunity to commend WAVE, under the leadership of Ms Peake.  She has been remarkable and over the past 30 years the organisation has provided group support and care for many families that have been bereaved or are victims of the conflict.  I note her remarks about the British Government's command paper in respect of the amnesty proposals.  It is striking that there is united opposition from victims, survivors and political parties right across this island.  I do not have many questions but what impact does Ms Peake feel these proposals will have on the overall process of reconciliation?

There is a detrimental impact for families, which we see today, with rising referrals of the bereaved coming into WAVE and people who have never tapped into services before coming in for the first time.  They are distraught.  They include, in particular, those whose loved ones were killed between 1986 and the Good Friday Agreement.  Those cases were never looked at by the Historical Enquiries Team, HET.<\/p><p>Some people were happy with the Historical Enquiries Team, other people were unhappy and others were left with questions arising from the process.  Those whose loved ones' deaths had never been re-looked at between 1986, which is when the Historical Enquiries Team ended its work, and the Good Friday Agreement is the group I see is particularly struggling through the processes currently.<\/p><p> There are three other points in relation to this.  The first is that we are handing it to the next generation.  I used to deal with the parents.  I used to deal with Vera McVeigh, if you want even to think of the families of the disappeared.  It is now Dympha and Oliver who are taking this forward.  Sadly, many of the parents in WAVE have died.  We have buried five people in the last two weeks alone.  Patsy McAteer, Ann's sister, was buried two weeks ago and a month ago, Michael's older brother, Archie McConville, died.  That is indicative of what we are seeing.  We are seeing many families losing their loved ones and it is the next generation who are taking it on.  We are merely handing the trauma of the past to the next generation but without an understanding of what the context was like at that time.  People who lived at that time know how manic it was and know what the systems were at that time whereas young people are looking at it devoid of that.  They are looking at it solely on the facts and that is an entirely different relationship.  I can see that in the transgenerational link.<\/p><p> It is fair to say there are still paramilitaries operating.  We are still seeing families affected by paramilitaries, whether it is on the loyalist side or the dissident republican side.  Quite simply, this will embolden paramilitaries to say that they will get away with this and they will not be held to account.  It is a damaging message for our society moving forward.  Nobody wants that for their children.  They want to move forward in a process of peace and they do not want to be held back.  The recent report yesterday of paramilitaries shows the problems of that when we look at the independent reporting mechanism.  There is a clear issue about emboldening paramilitaries.<\/p><p> The third point is it undermines the Good Friday Agreement.  We have to remember that many families voted in favour of this.  Fundamentally, it undermines the basis of that if we are now saying to families, once again, we are removing this from the table.  You are taking away the small glimmer of hope that families had.  We do not have wholesale families here expecting prosecutions but we expect them to know that the rule of law stands and that there should be a proper Article 2 compliant investigation into their deaths.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>There is still five minutes left in the Sinn F&eacute;in slot if members want to use it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#L00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639008000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>We are happy to move on, a Chathaoirligh.

I take this opportunity to compliment Ms Peake and all her colleagues in WAVE on the outstanding work they have done during the past 25 to 30 years.  They have a great record of advocacy on behalf of people who have suffered and continue to suffer so much.  The presentations made by the family members who have suffered and will continue to suffer so much through the loss of loved ones were powerful and dignified.  Their words encapsulated so well the heartbreak and suffering of families that we cannot even begin to imagine.  On every occasion I have had the opportunity  to engage with family members who have lost loved ones in the most horrific of circumstances, they have always said they want to get the truth and a Christian burial for their loves ones.  The clear message we heard today from each of the representatives who spoke is the importance of having a Christian burial and to know, for example, that a brother or an uncle is laid to rest in a family grave.  It is important for all of us, particularly from the Christian community and other communities, to have a Christian burial and to have the opportunity to go to a grave and say a prayer or lay a flower.  It is part of our make-up and our being.  We cannot comprehend how difficult it must be for a family knowing that a loved one was abducted, murdered and secretly buried.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Oliver McVeigh and other guests spoke about needing information.  As I did on the day we had commissioners from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains appeared before the committee, I stated that one of the stand-out quotes from the first report that the victims' commission in July 1999 was that anyone with the slightest shred of information on the possible location of bodies should make this known to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains.  There are people who have information and it may be more than the slightest shred of information.  As we did on the day the commissioners were with us, we appeal again and endorse every call that has been made for people who have any information to make sure it is brought forward.  <\/p> <p>  That goes back to Ms Peake's excellent presentation in which she outlined the work of the WAVE Trauma Centre.  Three themes that came through in her presentation were the solidarity of the families of the disappeared and of families whose loved ones' bodies have been recovered who still work and act in solidarity with the families who are still awaiting the return of their loved ones.  It is very heartening to know of that solidarity.  Ms Peake described the proposed amnesty by the British as a re-wounding of families who suffered so much.  It definitely is that.  It is reprehensible any Government could propose an amnesty for the perpetrators of heinous crimes.  I spoke in the D&aacute;il on this issue on Tuesday and the Taoiseach gave a clear response that the Irish Government is absolutely opposed to the British Government advancing such a proposal.  A framework in the form of the Stormont House Agreement has been in place for a number of years to deal with legacy issues and we need to see it implemented.<\/p><p>Ms Peake spoke about the need to ensure that where there is support for victims, it is adequate, generous and effective.  We will support advocacy groups such as WAVE in their requests to the British Government and other authorities to ensure that proper support is given to victims.<\/p><p> It was clear from her presentation and the presentation of our other guests that there is a need for information.  The ICLVR outlined clearly to us that since its establishment shortly after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and the appointment of Irish commissioners, successive Governments have provided all the resources and support that the independent commission needed.  Ms Peake reinforced that particular point.  They have the know-how and resources.  Information is the missing ingredient.  Sadly, that information is with some people and whoever has it needs to come forward.<\/p><p> Ms Peake also made a point about the loss of family members in recent weeks.  Many of the crimes we talk about in the context of legacy issues go back at least half a century.  As time goes on, memories and information will not improve.  The matter was always urgent but the necessity for information to get passed on becomes more urgent as time goes by so that meaningful, comprehensive and adequate investigations can be carried out.<\/p><p> The British proposal of an amnesty is deplorable.  That would cut off all avenues to getting to the truth with regard to crimes and would put an end to investigations and criminal prosecutions.  It is unbelievable that this type of proposal would be made by a British government.  It is rewounding families who have suffered so much over the decades.  <\/p><p> I reassure WAVE and the families with whom our guests work that we are anxious to do everything we can to support them.  When we spoke in Belfast, we discussed the possibility of a commemoration in Dublin, a specific day on which we would highlight the fact there are still people who were disappeared and whose bodies have not been recovered.  We discussed the possibility of a day in Dublin that would emphasise that, in particular.   I suggest the committee meets representatives of WAVE at least once a year, if not more often.  We sincerely hope that if bodies are recovered, we will deal with other legacy issues that the centre deals with.  The committee should engage with representatives of the centre and their family members at least once a year to reassure them of our continued support and to get the message out to the public that, unfortunately, there are families who have lost loved ones, whose bodies have not been recovered for more than 40 years.  All I can do is to compliment our guests on their excellent and dignified presentations.  They are making a simple appeal to try to get information and the truth, and to try to recover those bodies in order to afford families the Christian burial they wish for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#M00400","speaker":"1556","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639008000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The Deputy made the important point that memories do not improve.  We know that those who were involved in these cases in their teens or 20s are now coming towards the age of 70, in some cases.  Next year will mark 50 years since Ms Lynskey's uncle disappeared.<\/p><p>If you were in your 20s then, you will now be in your 70s now.  That is where there is a real urgency on this.  This is not something we have time to spend on.  In ten years, the committee will not be coming back to talk to us about it.  Time is of the essence.  Sometimes it is felt that it is only when the families jostle and highlight this that we get a flurry of activity.  We need this to be addressed now because people are getting older, dying or becoming ill - all the various things that happen in life - and we need to find the mechanisms.<\/p><p> I go back to the point Ms Morgan made.  We urge those involved in this to go back to the start of these cases, assume nothing, look at it as if they are looking at it for the first time and engage directly with the commission.  In Columba's case, they need to go back to the start of what they knew.  In Joe's case, they also need to go back to what they know.  There was a very limited search for Joe in Wilkinstown.  I do not know whether members know this, but Maria was on her way to the search site, believing he had been recovered, when she got a call just outside Dundalk to tell her it was not one body but two bodies and that, therefore, it was unlikely to be Joe and more likely to be Kevin McKee and Seamus Wright.  What a journey to make only to be told that halfway down the road.  However, for Philomena McKee and the Wright family, it was a good day, if we can say that, because their loved ones were returned.<\/p><p> We have to go back to the start to look at these cases.  There has been limited information on Joe and the searches too have been limited.  As for Columba, wherever he is, he is not where the indications suggested he was on Bragan Bog.  Bragan Bog is one of the most horrific places you can go.  It is four miles up a lane, remote, with no sign of life, cold and barren, with a feeling of true isolation.  We need people to go back to the start and consider this and we need people to engage directly with the independent commission.  I have been involved in these cases for 25 years.  I have sat with families who the commission told nothing more could be done because the people involved were dead, yet they were not dead and information came.  I urge them to go back to the start again and work step by step through the commission.  As Ms Morgan described, she had to make a move and highlight the issue again.  For many people, Columba is just a name, but he was a beloved son and brother and he had all sorts of things he liked and an impish personality.  He annoyed his older sister and his younger brother.  Joe, too, had his own qualities.  I urge those involved to go back to the start, look at these cases from the beginning and engage with the commission directly.  People are not getting any younger and time is of the essence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I was delighted to meet Ms Peake and others at the WAVE Trauma Centre in Belfast.

That needs to be pointed out.  If this was such a priority you would think there would be more Sinn F&eacute;in members here.<\/p><p>I welcome Mr. Michael McConville and Ms Maria Lynskey.  Most especially, I must state that my family is linked to that of Mr. Oliver McVeigh and Ms Dympna Kerr.  My parents knew their family so well.  There were many cups of tea in our kitchen.  One of the last conversations I had with my father before he died this day a month ago was about any opportunity I had to bring attention to their family and bringing Columba home.  Columba is never far from out thoughts and was never far from his thoughts.  As Oliver and Dympna know, he was part of the eulogy at Daddy's funeral.  I ask them how it feels when the leaders of a party that is so opposed to the amnesty and who talk the talk about truth and justice are holding back the information Oliver and Dympna need.  Those leaders have the power to provide that information and they are not giving it.  How does it feel when they say members of the IRA were not criminals, honour the horrors of the past and justify the past?  I also want to know whether our guests feel there is still a culture of <i>omerta<\/i>, silence and coercive control within that organisation and if that is a barrier to getting the truth.  I ask the Sinn F&eacute;in members who are here what they personally are going to do about it, if the information is not forthcoming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#P00300","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I want to follow on from what my colleague has said.

Sinn F&eacute;in has two slots whereas the rest of us might get a second slot if time comes around.  Today, however, Sinn F&eacute;in is not here.  I remember sitting beside John Finucane MP on 18 November at a similar meeting with the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, and it was the same thing.  Mr. Finucane spoke for four minutes and left the rest of the two slots vacant.  As I was listening to &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley today, it was interesting that she used the exact same words.  I would invite anybody to go back and look at that.  This generation of republicans wants to do something different, 13 of 16 people have been recovered and there are three that remain.  They then move on to the next issue about legacy and then are happy to move on.  It is deeply disappointing and cynical that this is the approach taken when, as members of the committee, we see the alternative approach that is taken by Sinn F&eacute;in on so many other occasions.

I can see on the Chairman&rsquo;s screen in miniature but it is coming through fine on mine.<\/p> <p>  I visited the WAVE Trauma Centre a number of weeks ago and when I left I thought about the whole day.  We heard from three separate victims and families of victims what compounded their hurt each time.  One was the phenomenon that justice is not arriving to people because the people who perpetrated the crime are not choosing to give up the information, which is as true of paramilitaries as it is of the UK Government.  It is also the fact that people&rsquo;s characters are besmirched.  We heard from the Ballymurphy families that they have been painted and pegged as gunmen and women for decades.  We heard from the McVeigh family of people being told that Columba was an informer.  We heard from Paul Gallagher that the man who shot him wrote in his book that he only ever shot paramilitaries and then, by extension, besmirched his character.<\/p><p>It is that second way of demeaning and degrading victims by undermining who they were and retrospectively creating a false narrative for why killings were carried out.  That is fundamentally worrying.<\/p><p> We do not have confidence that victim makers will have the good grace to leave victims in peace and not use the blank cheque of an amnesty to justify their own action.  I do not have any questions, other than what other colleagues have asked about how we can support victims and what we can best do in terms of how they want us to bring forward the campaign.  I thank the witnesses.  There is unanimity in the committee on trying to amplify the campaign and generally, to the extent that we can, tackle the legacy issues.

I echo what other speakers have said and pay tribute to them for their dignity and determination over many decades in trying to bring closure to their beloved family members, find out the truth of what happened to them and give them a proper burial and a place where the families can gather over the years to reflect and remember them.<\/p><p>I have no doubt whatsoever that there are people on the island of Ireland today who have information that will lead to the recovery of remains.  As others have said and I will stress, those people have a moral duty to come forward with that information and not go to their graves without revealing what they know.<\/p><p> I will use my time to highlight a couple of other points.  I will reference in particular the case of Lisa Dorrian, which was referred to in Ms Peake's opening statement and to which others have also alluded.  Lisa, because of the time of her disappearance, does not fall under the timeframe of the terms of reference of the commission.  Her circumstances are very similar to those of others.  Her family has also fought a very determined campaign to keep her case alive.  There have been a number of false dawns, including in the past year, when trying to find her remains and discover what happened to her.  The same point about people with information applies to her.  In most of the cases we are talking about the IRA.  In Lisa Dorrian's case we are talking about one of the various loyalist factions in Northern Ireland, but the pain is just the same.<\/p><p> It is also worth referencing a development in UK law, namely, Charlotte's law.  I appreciate that this may not have any direct relevance to WAVE's cases, but it perhaps shows how thinking is evolving on this issue.  Charlotte's law concerns a situation where somebody is convicted of a murder but the remains have not been found.  That person would not be eligible for release from prison until he or she was fully forthcoming with information.  I appreciate that in the absence of suspects and a criminal process, that type of law will not come into play in WAVE's cases, but it is something worth referencing for the future.<\/p><p> I appreciate it is not the direct source of our discussions today, but I will stress the absolute importance of ensuring we retain a rule of law and human rights-driven process around legacy.  We have that with the Stormont House Agreement.  The notion of an amnesty or a statute of limitations is not something we should consider.  It is very important that we make clear that there is a very clear distinction between the very limited immunities that relate to the passage of information relevant to the location of remains compared with the forgoing of prosecutions.  The UK Government, in particular, will often use that type of intervention to almost justify or rationalise what it is now proposing as just being one further step along the spectrum of interventions and that what has happened with the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains somehow sets a precedent.  It is important that we send out a very clear message that it does not.  We are talking about fundamentally different conceptions and applications and the two should not be conflated.  I am sure the witnesses will agree with that particular point.  I see Ms Peake wants to come in.  I am happy to pass over to her at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#T01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>We changed the rotation to make sure Deputy Costello could contribute earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#U00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>This is a very difficult session.

I thank the witnesses for coming and for their bravery in sharing their stories.  I thank Ms Peake and the WAVE centre for the support they provide and the work they do against that background.<\/p><p>I echo Dr. Farry's point that the rule of law and human rights are of fundamental importance.  There is a right to truth established in the European Court of Human Rights.  The truth ultimately is what the families before us are asking for.  As a committee, we are doing what we can to ensure that truth comes out and to help to heal the trauma and suffering in any way that we can.  <\/p><p> A question was asked earlier that I am not sure was answered.  I would like Ms Peake to set out what it is we can do.  We can have these sessions and make our appeals for information, but for those of us on this committee, what can we do to support WAVE Trauma Centre in the work it does?  Ms Peake mentioned the pension scheme.  There was a remembrance commission scheme here that paid out mostly once-off payments but my understanding is that medical payments for victims of the Troubles in need of medical treatment are available through the Victims of Crime Office.  There is no direct pension right.  In that regard, further information, even in writing, in follow-up to the committee would be very useful.  Senator Blaney also asked for that information and mentioned that the committee should engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on that issue.  Any additional information the witnesses could send to us that would shed a light on that would be very useful.  <\/p><p> I reiterate my question as to what we, as a committee, can do to support the important work that is being done in the search for that truth that is ultimately now the human right of the people before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#U00300","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Costello.

For the British Government the commission demonstrates the challenges of believing you will get information.  It is almost 22 years since the legislation went through and Columba McVeigh and Joe Lynskey still have not been recovered.  It has taken 22 years to get the bodies returned.  The committee is not asking Dr. Farry the big questions for the families such as, \"When did they die?\", \"What happened?\" and \"For how long were they held?\".  Mr. McConville referred to the questions; I am just conscious of raising those.  If it was any of our relatives, we would have questions to which we would want answers.  The families cannot get answers to those questions.  They can get answers to questions such as, \"Where did you walk them?\" and \"How far down did you put them?\", which is what the commission wants to know.  We have struggled to get that information.<\/p> <p>  If the British Government wants to say that this type of models works, well then, you get partial information.  You get information you can interrogate and it shows that, for whatever reasons, people or organisations do not want to go back to that in which they were involved in an earlier life.  It highlights that.  Information needs to be interrogated.  When the committee visited, Mr. McBride made the point very eloquently that had the information with regard to the Ballymurphy case not been interrogated, we would still have Ballymurphy relatives labelled today as being relatives of gunmen and gunwomen.  As mentioned by Mr. McConville, the sad reality for the disappeared is that they are still labelled.  That has never been lifted.  Often when you read an article it goes on to say that they were allegedly involved in X, Y and Z.  The reality is some of these people were very young, only 16, a number of them were young men who had learning difficulties and one of them was a mother of ten.  As raised by Mr. McConville, what could his mother have done?  She was rearing ten children.  She was widowed in January and abducted the following December and those children were left.<\/p> <p>  We have to bear in mind the reality of what is out there.  Senator Currie asked about questions.  What we understand from the commission is that a whole team can be involved in a disappearance, from the scouters to the drivers to the people who dug the graves.<\/p><p>We need to go back to the start and look at each case from the start.  Something has gone wrong from the start when we have not recovered those disappeared.  We need to go back and that is really important because it is not just one or two people.  <\/p><p> Mr. Geoff Knupfer appeared before this committee previously.  He does not often share the magnitude of the work he has been involved in but he did talk about his work on the moors murders investigation.  He spoke about the importance of the time of day in terms of where the sun was positioned, the landscape at the time and various other issues like how far up or across the site the investigators went and all of the things that made the difference to locating those children on the moors.  He applied the lessons from the moors to the cases here.  That very forensic approach has worked well.  It has also worked well because people have engaged and given information, which has been so important.  At all of the funerals of the disappeared, the families have acknowledged those people because had they not spoken, they would not have got the information needed to enable them to bury their loved ones.  <\/p><p> This leads on to the question as to what this committee can do.  We need an Ireland-wide publicity campaign.  We need people to know that the disappeared are out there.  We do not need it to be known today, only for it to go again in January and for us to come back before the committee in May or have to raise it with Senators Currie and Blaney or Deputy Costello or whoever.  We need an Ireland-wide publicity campaign.  We need to keep this issue in the public domain and we need to re-humanise Columba McVeigh, Joe Lynskey and Robert Nairac.  To have a British soldier in Irish soil in 2021 is unacceptable.  If we are truly concerned about reconciliation, he should be returned to be buried in his family grave in England.  His sisters should be allowed to lay him to rest; that is the right thing to do.  In Ireland we know the significance of burial and the last rites and that is what we need to give people.  <\/p><p> On the injury pension, we need parity.  We cannot have a situation where people who were injured by loyalist bombs in Dublin are not eligible for a scheme.  If it is not the scheme in the North, it should be a scheme that is similar that will give them dignity by providing yearly sums to enable them to live their lives as fully as possible while dealing with severe injury.  I urge the Government to do something about that.  It is so important and it must happen.<\/p><p> We really need this committee's help.  We need to ensure that the disappeared are not forgotten.  We need to keep applying pressure and letting people know that nothing will happen if they give information to the commission.  I must stress, and I am sure the families will agree, that the commission holds that confidentiality extremely tight.  It does not tell the families what it is involved in but it does tell them when it has an indication of where it going to go to search.  That is really key.  I do not know whether the families want to say something about confidentiality.  The commission, from what I have seen of its work, holds it very tight.  That needs to be said in order to reassure people.  This is a process that delivers but we need people to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Does any of the family members wish to comment?

When I was trying to get information I went directly to members of the INLA and spoke with them.<\/p><p>It was through that that I actually found Seamus.  The information came through two ex-prisoners.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, those men were allowed out of jail.  They carried on with their lives, got on with their careers or whatever else.  Those two men were inside when my brother was killed.  They had nothing directly to do with his murder.  They were not there at the time he was shot.  However, those two men had the information and it is now Sinn F&eacute;in's time to go back to all the ex-prisoners and all the men released under the agreement, get them around a table in a hotel or wherever else and get them talking because that could be the place where that information may be found.  It is appealing to the conscience of those who have had a second chance.  Those men may have this information that goes back 40 or 50 years.<\/p><p> We as a society need to look at what we have given the republican movement in this country and appeal to it.  Sinn F&eacute;in MPs and councillors are at the front of this but the answers to these problems lie with the background staff, if you want to call it that.  I mean the background members who were there at the time.  Young Sinn F&eacute;in councillors or whatever do not know anything about this so they do not know where to go.  It is now time for them to actually delve into this.  They really need to delve into it and appeal to the members who were members at the time.  They need to get back to them.  At one stage we had a meeting with Gerry Adams and I said it to him, even.  He said people have died.  Granted, people have died and we know that, and they might have been present when our loved ones were killed.  However, it was not the old men of the IRA who dug the graves.  They would have had the young members digging those graves in those bogs for those men who were going to be killed.  These were our sons and our brothers.  Young men would have been involved in the disappearance of any of the disappeared.  Now, 40 years on, we are talking about some people who might be in their 50s, some who might be in their 60s and even, I suppose, some who might be in their 70s.  We have got the 50-year-olds right up to the 70-something-year-olds to appeal to.<\/p><p> It is time Sinn F&eacute;in put it to its ex-members and reminded the ex-prisoners they were the ones who got the best deal out of the Good Friday Agreement.  The families of the disappeared are still trying to get a good deal from the agreement because three families, plus that of Lisa Dorrian, are still sitting waiting.  You do not know what it is like.  My appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in is to go back and make a concerted effort.  It could let the families of the disappeared know the party is appealing to the ex-prisoners and to those who were members 40 years ago or whatever.  It could let the families know it is doing that.  We are not going to make a song and dance about it but it is about our knowing the party is putting in place and carrying through something that would help with Columba McVeigh and help the families bring their loved ones back and give them a Christian burial.<\/p><p>I think it is time that Sinn F&eacute;in put it together and helped all these Irish people buried secretly in Irish soil.

I knew that I had to go to places that I definitely did not want to go to physically, never mind mentally.  I had to put myself out there and into the middle of them.<\/p> <p>  In one case, I and a few of the families of the disappeared went to an ex-prisoners conference in Limavady and I was in a room with a group of men who were all ex-prisoners.  They were from both sides - there were loyalists and republicans.  I told my story.  In that room, there were men who cried.  Now when I am telling my story, I cannot believe that it is that emotive.  At times I will get emotional, especially when I talk about my mother, her waiting for him and all of that.<\/p> <p>  The ex-prisoners actually were one of my keys to get into finding out where he was.  I did not realise on that particular day that I was talking to men in that room - in a group format sitting around in a circle - who were going to find my brother.  I did not know that.  It was four years before Seamus was found.  I kept asking.<\/p> <p>  I had a telephone number of a fellow whom I spoke to in 1999.  I did not use that glibly.  If something came up, I phoned him and asked, &ldquo;What was happening here?  I want to find out more.&rdquo;  I was not on his back as such.  I sort of built up an informal relationship with him.<\/p> <p>  In 2008, I went to France with my sister, Patsy.  Patsy passed away two weeks ago.  Anyway, Patsy and I were there for four days and the forensic team were doing their job.  At the end of the four days, they just said, &ldquo;Anne, he is not here where they said he was.  We cannot find him.&rdquo;  There were men in forensic team who were crying to me but I was so grateful for them having gone there and having done their job so well.  I was in admiration of them for what their skills involved in this process.  I went back to the hotel and met my sister in the room and I phoned that fella, who I had the number for, from 1999.  I called him all the Bs and Fs, and Cs.  All sorts of language was used.<\/p><p>I just had a pay-as-you-go phone in 2008.  My sister Patsy said to me that during that phone call I was jumping up and down and calling him all the so-and-so's of the day for not giving me the right information.  I was so annoyed with him.  My phone ran out of credit and the phone call stopped.  Patsy said that because of the things I said to him, he would never help me again.<\/p><p> After a few years, I was speaking with the ex-prisoners and decided I was going to go back to the first man I called.  We met here in Newry.  Ms Peake was with me that day.  She told me to just speak the truth and look him straight in the eye and say what I was looking for.  That is what I did.  My communicating with him directly helped me.  He said to Ms Peake, \"You should hear the conversation me and her had in 2008 and all the things she called me\".  He got all the obscenities I had in my head.  You would not say things like that to this fella normally, or get away with it, but he appreciated me just speaking from the heart and giving it back to him.  Is that not peculiar?  He said he was glad my phone ran out of money because God knows what else I was going to say to him.  I had formed that relationship with him.<\/p><p> When Seamus was found, which was brilliant, I had another meeting with this man.  I took him and the two men who were with him up to my house, into the room I am in now, and we had lunch.  Then I took him to the grave.  I said I did not want him going up to the grave in the dark of night or anything.  I wanted to take him and I took them up.  That was a big day for me because it had all started in 1985 when members of their organisation had pointed at me and said \"You're dead if you speak about Seamus again; you're dead if we ever hear anything more about him.\"  I was under the threat of death for all those years and as far as I was concerned, it was not lifted until Seamus was found.  Communication is the key to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Morgan.

We deal with quite a number of families who are engaged in Operation Kenova.  It is fair to say that at the start, they were very sceptical about what was a police-driven initiative led by an English police officer who was the chief constable of Bedfordshire police, Mr. Jon Boutcher.  That operation was looking into the alleged actions of an informer who was involved in the army.  People thought that it would be a whitewash or that they would get very little information.  When we asked families at the start what level of trust and confidence they had in the process, we found that it was very low.  They engaged but they did not expect to get anything from it.<\/p> <p>  Several things make Operation Kenova different from other legacy investigations and engagements with the police, one of which is the fact that it is victim-centred.  Through their actions, those involved in that operation give honour and respect to the person who has died.  Families are made to feel that their loved ones matter to the team.  The team refers to them by name and they get to know the family.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that there is continuity.  A big problem with legacy investigations, including those involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is that we are talking about serving police forces in which there is career progression.  Senator Black might deal with me this month but in six months time it might be Senator Currie and in another year, it might be Senator Blaney.   I can be passed from pillar to post continuously.  That is one of the issues.  Under Operation Kenova, however, there has been continuity.  These men and women, the family liaison officers, have built up relationships with families that have continued and the same person has seen them through in relation to their case.  The other issue is that the families have access to the head of the office, Mr. Jon Boutcher.  They all have his mobile number and can go to him if there is a problem.  They do not abuse that access but they have it.  I have never seen any other investigation where a chief constable gives out his or her mobile number and tells people, \"phone me if there is anything and I will answer it.\".  The investigators have taken the utmost care and sensitivity.  They have acknowledged family difficulties around anniversaries or when there are difficulties within families or when families are being approached by others.<\/p> <p>  People on this call will know this already but it is important for everyone else to know that some families are smirked at in the street.  The people who were involved in taking their loved ones use their name to let them know they are there.  They stare them out.  There is a level of closeness there in terms of the fact that it could be people who live in the next street or two street's away.  The families might see them at church, at school gates or in the middle of Tesco.  That is what really frustrates me about the legacy proposals.  People do not understand that this is not something that is addressed for some families.  They are living with the victimisation daily; it is continual.  Operation Kenova has been very supportive in that context.  Some of those families have been within that group and Operation Kenova has helped them when they have been approached and have continued to suffer victimisation.  That is really important.<\/p> <p>  There are files in for prosecution but not all families have files in and families accept that.  I have seen families get information that they never had previously.  These are families that came through the HET process or through Ombudsman investigations and who were told that there was nothing beyond what they already knew.  Operation Kenova  has given them information they never had previously.  The journey for Operation Kenova is as important as the end product.  The British Government is saying that it has not succeeded because there have been no prosecutions but that is only because there are 30 files sitting in our public prosecution office that have not yet been addressed and directions given on prosecutions.<\/p><p>We have urged the political parties, and we urge the Irish Government, to come behind this.  The Secretary of State keeps saying there is no agreement or alternative.  As this process works for families, everyone should get behind it and support it.  We need to put an end to the Secretary of State saying there is no agreement or that we cannot agree.  Ms Kerr said she is not interested in the politics.  I am interested in one thing only and that is the experience of the families and what they can get the best out of.  They are getting the best out of this so I urge people to look at it.  I ask the committee to invite Jon Boutcher to give a presentation to the committee in order that members can hear from him directly.  This is a process I have seen delivering and we feel it should be upscaled.<\/p><p> Ms Morgan said that her sister Patsy died two weeks ago and Mr. McConville buried his brother a month ago.  Processes to deal with the past are too late for them now but they represent so many others within our community who are dying daily without the answers they need.  To me, Operation Kenova is the historical investigations unit, HIU, by a different name and it is therefore ready to go.  It is the strands of accountability.  It is about the policy and procedures, and the victim-centred care.  It could readily deliver for families, particularly those who are terminally ill or those who have older relatives who want answers in their lifetimes.  We do not have time on this issue.  This is the last throw of the dice and we need to get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Peake for that.

I apologise; I missed the Belfast meeting because I was a close contact of someone with Covid at the time so I had to restrict my movements.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations today.  It is impossible to imagine the grief, loss and torture their families have been put through over that time.  I also thank them for the powerful contributions they have made.  It has been an education.  I knew a lot about these cases and situations but until you see the human face of their impact it is impossible to understand the magnitude of it.  In Meath, we know a good bit about the disappeared because the bodies of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee were found in County Meath.  Burying loved ones is a central part of the grieving process, as old as humanity itself.  It is hard to see a greater wrong that can be committed against anybody.  The point we hear over and over again when dealing with victims and survivors is that there is a generation of people who have not long to live and it is important that that information is given to them.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the pension scheme for victims and survivors of atrocities in the South.  It is not something that is very regularly discussed in the South but we as a committee need to start raising it more in general discussions.<\/p> <p>  Most of the questions I was going to ask have been asked at this stage.  Ms Morgan's contribution is very important.  I was sorry to hear about the loss of her sister in the last few weeks.  Face-to-face discussions with people involved in these actions are the key to this.  I hear information that there are certain people who are willing to help but there are others who have just drawn a line under things and are not willing to participate in any way whatsoever.  It is hard to underestimate the power of a person sitting in front of another individual as a moral lever, or crowbar, to see what can happen and if the right thing can be done.<\/p><p>I appeal to anyone with influence in this to see if those face-to-face meetings can happen and that all the details of what happened to those loved ones are made known, not just the locations.<\/p><p> We often hear that there is no hierarchy of victims.  If there is no hierarchy of victims, those who have had loved ones disappeared are equally as entitled as those who lost loved ones to the Glenanne Gang, the British army or anyone else.  There has to be full equality among victims on this.<\/p><p> Following Ms Peake's suggestion, I propose that the committee invite Mr. Jon Boutcher to discuss his work on trying to find out the truth about what happened on the past.  <\/p><p> My next question is not an argument I am making but it is an argument that is sometimes made.  What role has the passage of time played regarding the ability to get to the truth?  What are the witnesses views on that?  Can the independent commission be strengthened in any way to help with its work?<\/p><p> On the British policy of moving towards an amnesty, has WAVE looked at legal avenues to prevent the British from enforcing an amnesty which in my vie would be contrary to the Good Friday and Stormont House agreements and human rights law? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#DD00400","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639008000,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Most of the people at this meeting today are republicans.

Ms Lynskey said it was 2008 before there was any confirmation.  In 1999 when the list of the disappeared was released it was not complete.  There were others who were not on it.  Peter Wilson and Joe Lynskey were added later in 2008.  One of the difficulties is that there may be people in the area who know something but do not know that it is significant.  I say that because there were four cases in that area.  There were Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee in Wilkinstown, Brendan Megraw was in Oristown and then there is Joe Lynskey.  There has been a search for him in Wilkinstown and a limited search for him in Oristown.  The search in Wilkinstown produced Seamus and Kevin which was good.<\/p> <p>  The parish priest reached out to the families and that was the first time.  One of the things was trying to take it back into the heart of the community.  People were very reluctant.  They said there was a great shame in the area because this had happened in their locality.  They had farmed and tended to those bogs and cut peat in them and there was an embarrassment that this had happened and those bodies had been buried in their midst.<\/p><p>They did not know how to reach out.  The first thing for the families was to acknowledge that there was nothing to be embarrassed about.  It was not their fault that the bodies had been taken to that area.  There was something about the fact that they could actually provide help.  We had a blessing of Oristown bog before one of the searches for Brendan Megraw.  That search did not produce anything.  The family of Philomena and Kevin McKee went round with the priest.  Bishop Smith was very good to us at the time.  He has since retired.  He had empathy for the disappeared because he had lost a relative on 11 September 2001, so he knew the difficulties of when people did not come home and could not be buried.  He had empathy with the families.  He went and blessed Wilkinstown.<\/p><p> I said it to the other families when we were leaving.  We had a warm welcome in Oristown.  People came out to the bogland when there was the blessing there.  That was a major occurrence for the families because they had never met the families and the families had never met them.  They talked about the shame.  On the way home, I asked if they wanted to see where Philomena McKee was.  We went to Wilkinstown.  Local people stopped and talked about some of what had been witnessed.  Somebody had been coming along the road.  They had heard something and described what it was.  Looking back, when Kevin and Seamus were found, there was truth within that.  A man had died but he had told another neighbour, who had passed it on.  There is information in communities that they may not realise is significant.  If the Deputy could do anything to bring it back into the heart of the community, that would help us.<\/p><p> At the end of the day, those bogs were chosen by somebody who knew the bogs.  They had to know the landscape to know the best place to hide a body.  The information may well lie within the community in some cases.  I am not saying that everybody from the community was involved and do not think that, but that the community might be able to provide some information but does not know that it is significant to the commission.  Anything that the Deputy can do to help us with Joe Lynskey would be welcome.  All we want is his recovery.  There is one thing which I know Mr. McVeigh will say, which made a difference in Crossmaglen.  Charlie Armstrong was in his 50s.  He disappeared one morning on his way to mass.  His neighbour disappeared the year before.  They were never claimed on any list but the families believe strongly that they were killed by the IRA.  They were never accounted for.  One issue was that there was silence in the area.  We went back to do masses in the area.  Crossmaglen Rangers was good at providing some signage at the grounds to let people know that there was a system and process in place.  That was a major help in uncovering those two men, because it was brought to the heart of the community and the community wanted to address it.  Those two men are now laid to rest in St. Patrick's graveyard in Crossmaglen.  We cannot always rely on people who are still living in the area.  They may already have moved out of the area, which is why there needs to be a wider publicity campaign.  Anything that the Deputy can do in the local area would help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I commit to raising it again in County Meath.

The IRA gave information that our mother was buried on Templetown beach.  My mother was eventually found on Shelling Hill beach.  When they gave the examples of where they went on the beach in Templetown beach, to be fair to the IRA, Shelling Hill beach was similar.<\/p><p>They say that they walked across a wee stream.  There is a stream on Templetown beach.  There is also a stream on Shelling Hill beach.  The mistake was made by the IRA in thinking that it was on Templetown beach.  In other cases, mistakes could have been made as well.  For example, in 1999, when the first digs appeared down on Templetown beach, we were standing there for 50 days.  We got to know the local people.  They were very good to us.  An elderly man came to me.  He was talking away, beside Templetown beach.  He told me that I should ask them to go and dig on Shelling Hill beach because the IRA had two caravans on Templetown beach when they were on the run from the North.  He said that he could not see them burying my mother on their own doorstep when they were on the run from the North.  That man knew it was the other beach that they were talking about.  I am trying to explain some similar things that could happen in the other cases too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#FF00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McConville","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Very good.

I will watch all of the testimony later this evening, from the start to the point that I missed, on the Oireachtas website because it is so important.  While I have not met many of the witnesses yet, I had the privilege of meeting and speaking to Mr. McConville in Belfast a number of weeks ago.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of points I would like to make, particularly as, after three hours, many of the questions have already been asked.  When I visited Belfast and we met with the Ballymurphy and Springhill families, I was struck by the blanket of support that was wrapped around them by politicians from every political party and none, by civil society and by the Governments, North and South.  When we visited the WAVE Trauma Centre, we met Mr. McConville and others.  What stuck me was how it paled in comparison when I considered that these were families by themselves, with little or no political support, trying to trudge along with it.  They were not having their cases championed by political parties.  They were not having their cases brought to Westminster, the D&aacute;il or Stormont.  They have been trudging along by themselves on a lonely path for the past 40 years.  That was the comparison.  The reason is because their loved ones were murdered by republicans and people involved in the IRA.  The irony of it is the concept of a hierarchy of victims.  It is trotted out, time and again, that there is no hierarchy of victims.  There bloody well is a hierarchy of victims, and the families of the disappeared are at the very bottom of that ladder as far as I am concerned.  That is as clear as day from listening to the contributions of the family members today.<\/p> <p>  The first real injustice that was committed was the murder of their family members and the evil acts that they were.  The second injustice that was inflicted on family members of the disappeared was the blackening of their names for decades afterwards and the ostracisation of their families by their communities in order to try to justify why their family members were taken away and murdered.<\/p><p>The third real injustice is the fact that the bodies of their loved ones have not been returned to them.  I believe those are the three greatest injustices that have been committed against them.<\/p><p> The concept is what Sinn F&eacute;in can do.  I find it difficult when the same line is trotted out whereby Sinn F&eacute;in asks everyone to go ahead and give information and asks anyone with information to do this.  That is very easy to say.  I am not asking that Deputy McDonald or someone comes out and says that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to do this.  What I am asking is similar to what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked.  There are people in Sinn F&eacute;in today who were IRA gunmen.  There are people in Sinn F&eacute;in today who took lives and murdered people.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, some of those people are not willing to help and have drawn a line under this.  It would be really useful, and we are not asking to make a whole rigmarole of this, if Sinn F&eacute;in went back privately to those people and told them it wants them to do this, that it understands times have changed and events have been forgotten but it wants them to look at this again.  Three people are buried somewhere in cold, dark Irish soil who have not been returned to their loved ones.  Sinn F&eacute;in should say it wants to do this if it is serious about there being no hierarchy of victims.  That is something I believe the Sinn F&eacute;in Party could do.<\/p><p> I come from Dundalk in County Louth.  Dundalk and north Louth were on the front line of the Northern Irish Troubles for so long and bore the brunt of it for so long.  I think regularly about the family of Tom Oliver, whom I know personally.  When I listen to conversations of family members today, I think the Oliver family must thank their lucky stars that Tom was found.  His body was dumped on the side of a road so at least he could be found and buried.<\/p><p> I will follow up on what Mr. McConville said.  Again, I know the part of the world he spoke about extremely well.  There is not much distance between Temple Hill beach and Shelling Hill beach.  It shows the importance of what a local person in the Cooley Peninsula to tell Mr. McConville that, based on that information, he was able to provide information about the location of caravans in which members of the IRA used to hide out.  Based on that information from a local person, he was able to provide very useful information.<\/p><p> When I contribute at committee meetings, I tend to ask questions.  As the final speaker, I felt it was important to make a statement on a matter on which I have had deeply-held beliefs for many years.  Having to listen to the pain and trauma these families have gone through and continue to go through has been one of the toughest moments for me, as a Member of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> There is a very simple way this can be resolved.  I am not being political about it.  The point is that if Sinn F&eacute;in, which is in government in the North aspires to be in government in the Republic, wants to move forward towards a shared island in which we can all live, how will it be able to do so when people in its own organisation know where these three or four people are buried and continue to stay quiet?  That is my view on it.  Sinn F&eacute;in knows what it must do.  Empty  words and platitudes are not good enough now.  Oliver McVeigh said he is willing to talk to anyone and wants to do so.  I cannot speak for the families but they just want to find their loved ones and take them home, as any of us, as normal, decent human beings, would.  Let us be decent human beings and make sure these people come home to their families where they belong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#GG00400","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":555,"content":"<p>We do not have much time left and I am conscious that people wish to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#HH00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639008000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>What Senator McGahon just said is exactly the way it has been.  It has been the families standing alone.  We had WAVE behind us alright but it has been the resilience of the families standing alone and making it known that their loved one has been disappeared and buried secretly somewhere.  The Senator brought up the idea of the isolation you feel when somebody in your family has been disappeared.<\/p><p>Communities and neighbours want to isolate you.  No one wants to speak about it.  Over time, you know the person you are looking for has died but no one commiserates with you.  It is not the same as when a person dies and is buried within three or four days.  People just do not talk about it.  In my case, it was only when my brother was found that the community stood with me.  For 32 years, they all stood silently somewhere away from me.  It was only my close friends and family who were close to me.  The community was away from me.<\/p><p> When Seamus was found, the local bishop at the time, Bishop McAreavey, said the town had let out a big sigh of relief that Seamus was found.  That was the way it was.  When Seamus was buried, it was a big occasion and a big day for the people to come out and give us support.  However, we did not get that support in the years before Seamus was found.  People were reluctant to openly show they were supporting us.  When you are going through it, you do not realise it is happening and you are being ostracised.  Nobody wants to speak about your loved one being murdered and secretly buried.  No one wants to take notice of it.  It is good that we are able to speak about it before this committee and to let members know that the families are still together.  During our campaign, if we lost family from our local areas, we gained a very big and enriching family within the WAVE organisation.  The Senator made a point about the families being on their own and that is exactly the way it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>We are running tight on time.

There has been clarity in the manner in which they have outlined the terrible grief and suffering of families.  I said at the outset that we should have a commemoration in Dublin, similar to that held by the families in Stormont each year, to try to keep a focus and create an awareness of this issue.  It would also show that we stand with the families and abhor the fact that the families were shunned by some people in their communities over the years.  As the Oireachtas, we should mark the events.  Perhaps the committee secretariat could speak to Ms Peake about that in the future.  I think we should do that publicly.<\/p> <p>  Senator McGahon said the D&aacute;il had shown no interest in this matter over the years.  For the sake of accuracy, I want to point out that I, for one, and I can only speak for myself, have raised this issue many times over the years.  At my request, this committee met representatives of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains a number of times and I previously suggested that representatives of WAVE be invited before the committee.

I think what the Senator meant was that the people who could do the most did not do what they could do both at the meeting and in the past.  My father was a TD up until 2002.  He arranged meetings with the families of the disappeared and raised the issue plenty of times in the D&aacute;il as well.  As I said earlier, the disappeared are never far from my thoughts and my family's thoughts.  The SDLP and the Alliance Party talk about thee disappeared a great deal, as has the Fine Gael Party, including Senator McGahon.<\/p> <p>  We do not need the Stormont House Agreement to come to a resolution of this issue.  The people who have the answers can bring them forward to give peace to the families.  I sincerely hope that today's meeting has moved that along and will send out a clear message that the disappeared are not forgotten.  The idea of a publicity campaign is a good one.  Anything we can do to bring peace to the families and bring their loved ones home, we will do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#KK00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Quite so.  Before we finish, I will call on Ms Peake to recap on some of the issues we have to deal with.  We have not told the families this but the committee agreed at a previous meeting to visit the places where the remains are believed to be.  We hope to do that.  We got the consent of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains to do that, which is very important.<\/p> <p>  I note that Ms Morgan's battle was fantastically fought and eventually successfully won.  We have met as a committee with the republican ex-prisoners and, maybe, through the support of Mr. Paul Maskey and other bona fide Sinn F&eacute;in members of this committee, which I respect, it might be useful to arrange that process, if that makes sense.  The best way to do that would be through Ms Peake, if that is not too much to ask.  That might be a constructive way to engage.  All political parties have to engage.  Meetings between the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in and the families would be very important.  We should, again through Ms Peake, request that Deputy McDonald meet with the families.  Those are the constructive things we can do and I hope we can all agree on them.  If anyone wishes to raise other issues, that can be done in private session in a couple of minutes.<\/p> <p>  It has been very productive, emotional and powerful to witness the pain and suffering of our guests.  The obvious solution is to find the remains of the disappeared and bury them in a Christian way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#KK00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639008000,"counter":564,"content":"<p>On behalf of all of us, I thank the committee.  We have appreciated the opportunity to appear it.<\/p> <p>  It has been deeply painful.  I am conscious that Michael McConville's mum's anniversary has just passed.  She was taken 49 years ago.  I always want to remember those who have walked along the way and journeyed, yet are no longer with us.  It was a sad day burying Patsy McAteer recently and burying Archie McConville before that.  Archie always carried what happened to his mum with him right to the very end.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of things.  Whatever the committee can do for publicity, we ask members please do not forget the families of the disappeared and please let this have a legacy beyond today.  It has been very painful for families to come to the meeting.  Members will have other priorities, hear other cases and have other constituency issues matters of government to deal with but this needs to be addressed for these families.  This is their legacy and there is no peace until we give those families what they rightfully need.<\/p><p>Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh, Robert Nairac and Lisa Dorrian all need to be returned to their families.  Any other families out there who believe their loved ones have been disappeared also need to have a mechanism to bring that forward and to highlight it.<\/p><p> We need help locally from members.  I urge anybody who can to help us to do so in their area, such as Senator McGahon with Robert Nairac, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n in Meath and Deputy Brendan Smith and whoever else in Monaghan.  They might not realise that what they have is significant, but it could be very significant for the commission.<\/p><p> We urge Sinn F&eacute;in to please go back to the start and look at these cases and reassess them.  This needs to be addressed.  We have shown that with additional pressure from the families and additional work, we can recover bodies.  The commission has demonstrated that its work only works because the information comes to it.  It is important to acknowledge the information that has come to date.<\/p><p> Disappearing people is the cruellest of acts.  I buried my own father.  I know where he is.  We can mark and honour his place of burial.  These families do not have that.  Members might not know that the mothers put their sons names on the headstones before they died, handing the responsibility to the next generation.  Anne Morgan's mother put Seamus's name on the headstone.  Vera McVeigh did the same.  The same was done for Joe Lynskey.  Brendan Megraw's mother did the same.  That is very powerful.  Imagine having a headstone with a name on it and no body in the grave.  These families need the bodies to be returned.<\/p><p> People are getting older and it is getting harder.  Those with information are getting older and it is getting harder.  We need a push on this now, not to come back in a year's time to say we have made no progress.  We need help.  As the circle is getting smaller, it is becoming harder for the families to wait.  Oliver McVeigh always says that.  He says that when they were part of a bigger group and lots of people were disappeared, somehow it was a bit easier but as the circle has got smaller, the families are asking if they are going to be the only people not to have their loved ones returned.  That has become very hard.  That is said within the solidarity of support that is provided by WAVE and through the families of the disappeared, who are an amazingly supportive group.  I urge members to do everything they can in terms of publicity and policy to help the families and to not forget about them.<\/p><p> Regarding the injured pension, the legacy for the injured is to be looked after with dignity in their older age and to have respect and dignity.  I urge members to please move that forward to ensure equity.  I ask members to continue to push on the issue of legacy because that is hurting families.  It is painful.  Families are distraught at the thought of what may come.  I urge committee members to do anything they can, individually and collectively, and to please continue to do it.<\/p><p> Members are welcome to come to WAVE at any time.  The families wear a little badge, which is a little forget-me-not designed by Anne Morgan.  I will send some of them to the committee and when they are next in, I would ask them to wear the badges in solidarity with the families and in remembrance of them.  People will ask what they are and then that allows us to open up the discussion and to ensure this is not forgotten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021120900002#KK00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639008000,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Peake very much.
