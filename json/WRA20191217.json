The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and it is currently on a development path arising from the recommendations of the White Paper. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper sets out a blueprint for the development of the RDF and that the primary role is to support the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in crisis situations. In non-crisis situations the main focus will be in training for this role. The White Paper states that the types of tasks that the RDF could be required to undertake in crisis situations is varied.<\/p>  <p>  The principal legislation underpinning deployment of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is the Defence Act 1954. This legislation provides for, among other things, the call out of members of the RDF on permanent service during periods of emergency and the call out of members of the RDF in Aid to the Civil Power. The White Paper on Defence provides for a review of this legislation to identify proposals for any changes in the Defence Acts that may be required in order to reflect the possible crisis situations, where activation of members of the RDF is appropriate. This work has not commenced as yet as other tasks have been prioritised.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper also acknowledges that there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the PDF. In this context, there may be individual members of the RDF, who by virtue of their professional civilian qualifications or in the case of members of the FLR, professional military skills, have the competence to undertake such specialised tasks. These could include ICT, medical, ordnance and engineering professionals. The White Paper provides for the establishment of a panel of such individuals to be established, to be known as the Specialist Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two White Paper projects have been identified which are important precursors to the establishment of a Specialist Reserve. A Skills survey of the RDF was conducted in 2015\/16. The survey highlighted the existence of a substantial body of skills and qualifications in areas such as science, computing, engineering and medicine which have a direct relevance to the Defence Forces.  A gap analysis of skills sets in the PDF will identify potential roles for those Reserve members who possess specialist skills and this is linked to an ongoing Workforce Planning project. <\/p>  <p>  The ultimate intention is to utilise those Reservists who have specialist skills for which gaps exist in the PDF, and whose personal circumstances allow them to do so, to undertake required tasks in the Defence Forces, including on overseas missions.

PESCO is a capability development mechanism provided for under the EU treaties to deliver capabilities in support of CSDP missions and operations. It represents a further development in EU cooperation in support of international peace and security.  PESCO enables member States, including Ireland, to further develop their capabilities in support of peacekeeping through participation in joint projects with like-minded partners. It also has the potential to help reduce the cost of developing and procuring necessary capabilities.<\/p>  <p>  As a committed EU Member State, Ireland supports fully the efforts of EU Member States to improve the Union's capacity to respond to the prevailing challenging security environment, including in the area of defence. Within the framework of CSDP, Ireland has supported the development of recent EU defence initiatives with a view to enhancing the EU&rsquo;s capacity to engage in peace support and crisis management operations, particularly in support of the UN and to delivering the necessary capabilities, both civil and military to this end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700057#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Transport","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700057#WRB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[50046\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700057#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will report on his use of the Government jet to date in 2019.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>The Ministerial Air Transport Service provides the Government and the President with an independent and flexible air transport service to assist in meeting national and international obligations. <\/p><p>Requests for the use of the service are made to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office where they are examined with regard to the need and purpose of travel.

The establishment of PESCO in December 2017 represented a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  <\/p>  <p>  Through participation in all aspects of CSDP, Ireland has been able to influence the overall direction of CSDP, in particular ensuring recognition by the EU of the UN as its key strategic partner and ongoing support for the UN and multilateralism.  Participation in PESCO is important in continuing that influence.  <\/p>  <p>  PESCO provides a framework for capability development designed to contribute to enhanced capabilities for CSDP crisis management operations in the medium to long term so as the EU has greater capacity to act in support of international peace and security.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is currently participating in two PESCO projects - (1) The European Union Training Mission Competence Centre and (2) Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance, and is an observer on a further nine projects. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO, Ireland, together with fellow participating Member States, have made several commitments which include regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms, increased cooperation on cyber defence and the use of the European Defence Agency as the forum for joint capability development, among other commitments. As a participating Member State, the PESCO commitments inform our defence planning in the short, medium and long term. Ireland also completes an annual PESCO National Implementation Plan which is shared with other participating Member States in order to track progress on  these commitments. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to engagement with European defence manufacturers, the principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to ensure fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU procurement Directives, including the Defence and Security Directive. Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions.  In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Ireland's overall participation in PESCO and the specific PESCO projects in which we are engaged, my Department has not been subject to lobbying by European arms manufacturers.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, to ensure our Defence Forces have the best equipment required to undertake the roles assigned by Government, including on difficult and dangerous overseas operations, it is important that officials and members of the Defence Forces remain abreast of the latest developments in defensive and military equipment through engagement with industry representatives and manufacturers.  My Department would also engage in market sensing and attend international conventions on military equipment in this regard.  In the normal course, manufacturers would also meet with officials and members of the Defence Forces to make presentations on new and emerging technologies and equipment.  This is part and parcel of the business of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700057#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700058#WRC00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700058#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[52887\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700058#WRC00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the rate of employment for those of working age and classified as having a disability; and the way in which this compares to the EU average.","asker":"1262","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[52948\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700058#WRC00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the rate of employment here for those of working age and classified as having a disability; and the way in which this compares to the EU average.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.<\/p><p>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. <\/p><p>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household survey which provides quarterly statistics on employment and unemployment and is the official source of labour market estimates in the State.

This resulted in the introduction of the IREF (Irish Real Estate Fund) framework in 2016.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments are being made to the taxation of REITs, IREFs and section 110 companies in Finance Bill 2019. A number of anti-avoidance measures are being introduced to the IREF regime to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property by preventing the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits and preventing the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. In addition, the IREF return filing requirement is being placed on a mandatory annual footing and the information which Revenue can request has been increased to facilitate ongoing monitoring of the sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Several amendments are being made to the taxation of REITs in the Finance Bill 2019 to ensure the regime operates as intended.\u00a0 The obligation to deduct REIT Dividend Withholding Tax has been extended to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals and new measures have been introduced to require the proceeds of property disposals to be re-invested in property assets or distributed within a set period. The deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status have been restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Section 110 sets out a regime for the taxation of special purpose companies set up to securitise assets. A number of amendments are being made to the section 110 regime in the Finance Bill 2019 to strengthen the significant restrictions to the deductions which a section 110 company can claim for payment of profit participating notes to a specified person. The amendments also place the section&rsquo;s main purpose test on an objective basis, which will enable Revenue to more effectively challenge abuse of the legislation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the 2018 Finance Act process I committed to produce a report on REITs, IREFs and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market.

No. 174 of 2019), earlier this year, the NCID has been established in the Central Bank of Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that yesterday, 16 December 2019, the Central Bank of Ireland published the first National Claims Information Database Report on Private Motor Insurance, which includes aggregate data from the NCID.\u00a0 The aggregate nature of the data collected has meant that there are fewer legal and technical complexities involved, and that is why it has been possible to have the NCID established and reporting so quickly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Both Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I commend the work of the Central Bank in bringing this Report to fruition.\u00a0 We believe it is an excellent report, which provides an objective overview of private motor claims costs including legal costs over the last number of years. <\/p>  <p>  I would hope that going forward the increased transparency brought about by the NCID, along with other legislative changes, can help to provide more stability in the market, thus avoiding the peaks and troughs for consumers in terms of premium pricing.\u00a0 This should ultimately make the Irish market more attractive to new entrants and I would hope that this might be one of the outcomes of this exercise in time.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the Report shows that the insurance and legal sectors have both serious questions to answer regarding the difficulties we have faced over the last number of years with the price of motor insurance.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that insurers under-priced in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses incurred and consequently are now making significant profits.\u00a0 At the same time, the legal costs associated with the litigation settlement channel seem disproportionate when one considers that the report indicates that the award levels for those settlements under &euro;100,000 are not much higher than equivalent settlements in PIAB.\u00a0 In addition, the length of time to settle these claims is nearly two years longer than in PIAB, which in itself drives up the cost of insurance.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While it is true to say that the nature or severity of the injury claims settled in the different channels can vary significantly and there may be good reasons for pursuing litigation, I believe that this report makes it clear that in overall terms, PIAB offers the most cost-effective settlement channel and I would hope that its settlement rates increase going forward.\u00a0 This is a key aim of the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NCID Report also demonstrates why we must address award levels in this country if we want to see cheaper insurance premiums and an increased risk appetite from insurers.\u00a0 In this regard, the NCID Report shows that personal injury claims have been driving the cost of claims in recent years &ndash; representing 75% of the ultimate claims costs over the period.\u00a0 This is not sustainable in my view.\u00a0 This is all the more concerning as the Report shows that these increased costs are not being driven by a higher frequency of claims.\u00a0 I believe that our focus therefore must continue to be on the Judicial Council and its publication of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to employer and public liability insurance claims related information being incorporated into the NCID, the Deputy should note that the Central Bank has the power to expand the scope of the NCID to other classes of non-life insurance under the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.\u00a0 The Deputy will recall that our focus was on ensuring that the NCID was able to collect private motor insurance first and it was for that reason that the CIWG recommended that the Central Bank first undertake a study on the merits and feasibility of expanding the scope of the NCID to employer and public liability insurance claims (recommendation 2). \u00a0The Central Bank is finalising its consideration of the merits and feasibility of collecting this data and the CIWG expects to receive the Central Bank&rsquo;s final view on this shortly in line with the timeframe for the recommendation.\u00a0 \u00a0A decision will be made at that stage as to whether the database will be expanded to cover employer and public liability insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700059#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rebates","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700059#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[52697\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700059#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rate of VAT rebate at the point of sale paid to regular farmers, feedlot farmers and factory owned feedlots;

This rate applies to all qualifying farmers across all agricultural sectors, including farmers involved in intensive farming such as farming activities described as feedlots. The VAT registered business treats the flat-rate amount as a normal business input in its periodic VAT return, claiming input credit for the flat-rate amount paid to the flat-rate farmer. <\/p>  <p>  The flat-rate addition is reviewed each year and adjusted where necessary to ensure that farmers who are not registered for VAT are compensated at the aggregate level for the unrecoverable VAT borne on their input costs. <\/p>  <p>  The operation of the flat-rate addition scheme in respect of feedlots has been the subject of previous questions but unless there are structures and contractual arrangements in place to enable the industry to engineer a systematic excess of flat rate addition payments over VAT costs no VAT policy issue arises.

Option 2\u00a0is for the introduction of Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the estimated cost of allowing LPT as an allowable expense against rental income for Income Tax purposes is in the region of &euro;12 million in the first year and &euro;20 million in a full year.\u00a0This estimate is based on LPT returns that indicate a property is a non-principal private residence and assumes that each relevant owner has sufficient rental income against which to offset the LPT paid. <\/p>  <p>  LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore the measure is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms, so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market.\u00a0 The measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and\u00a0would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. \u00a0I note that one of the recommendations of the 2015 review of the LPT carried out by Dr. Don Thornhill on behalf of the Minister for Finance was that LPT payments should not be allowed as a deduction to landlords against income or corporation tax. Dr. Thornhill&rsquo;s view was that deductibility for landlords does not rest easily with the concept of the LPT as a tax on the amenity value of residential properties rather than as a business cost. Owners and tenants of rental properties both derive value from the amenity value of these properties (the owner in the form of the rent and the tenant from living in the property). This contrasts with the situation regarding local authority rates on commercial properties.\u00a0 Owner occupiers are not allowed to claim LPT as a deduction against income tax. It is not appropriate on conceptual and equity grounds that they should.\u00a0 Dr Thornhill considered that there was a need to ensure equity between owners of all residential properties, \u00a0whether owner occupiers or landlords, and that it would be inappropriate to allow LPT as a deduction against the taxation of income from rents on residential properties. The Inter-Departmental LPT Review Group that reported to me in 2019 was in agreement with Dr Thornhill&rsquo;s\u00a0 recommendation and the rationale which underpinned it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700060#WRE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Costs","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[53432\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the first and full-year cost of establishing an enhanced loss relief for landlords to allow relief for rental losses against other income sources in the same year.","asker":"1228","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>The Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Landlords was published by my\u00a0Department on Budget Day 2017.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ten policy options were put forward in the report, divided into short-term, medium-term and long-term timeframes. Option 3 is to enhance\u00a0loss relief for landlords (or a sub-set of landlords), to allow relief for rental losses against other income sources in the same year. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, landlords can carry-forward their rental losses for offset against future rental profits, but cannot offset rental losses against other net taxable income in the current year, other than other rental profits from other properties. However, rental losses can currently be carried forward indefinitely against future rental income, even after the loss-making property has ceased to be a rental property. This is in contrast to the treatment of trading losses under Case I, where the loss relief effectively ceases when the trade ceases. The current system of rental loss relief has the effect of encouraging landlords to remain in the market, in order to avail of the loss relief against future streams of rental income. Allowing offset of rental losses against all other income could potentially encourage landlords to exit the market at an earlier date, once their losses had been fully relieved against other income. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in 2017, the latest year for which tax returns are currently available, there was approximately &euro;1.45bn in rental losses from prior years that were available to be offset against rental income in that year. Assuming losses of &euro;1.45bn to be available for offset and applying an average (blended) tax rate, the tax cost could be tentatively estimated at &euro;420m. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Revenue advise that approximately 10% of those with rental income in 2017 did not have other income sources, in which case there would be no extra tax cost for that segment. For all other taxpayers, the tax cost associated with such a change would vary for each taxpayer, depending on the nature of their income, their level of available losses carried forward, and their level of income. \u00a0Also, tax returns do not separately capture unused losses for residential and commercial properties, therefore this estimate includes losses in relation to commercial properties as well as residential properties.\u00a0For these reasons, the estimate presented above should be considered highly provisional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[53433\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the first and full-year cost of allowing a deduction against rental income for the capital cost of the property in the initial years of ownership of a rental unit; and the corresponding reduction in the base cost of the property on a future disposal.","asker":"1228","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>The Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers (published by my Department on Budget Day 2017) identified the measure suggested by the Deputy as a possible medium-term option.

The works to be funded are carried out under Local Authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the Council.<\/p><p>Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.\u00a0 Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management.<\/p><p>Under this Scheme, over 530 Minor Works projects have been completed to the end of 2018, providing local flooding solutions to almost 6,800 properties with expenditure amounting to &euro;34.7m over the same period.\u00a0 This year to date, 32 projects amounting to &euro;3.1m have been approved and notified to local authorities.Full details of this scheme are available on <i>www.opw.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Shortages","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[52564\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700061#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he is taking to address labour shortages in the construction sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>The Government is closely monitoring all aspects of construction skills and labour supply, through the national skills database and through the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora.\u00a0 The EGFSN is currently tendering for a skills demand study to determine the demand and nature of the Irish Construction sector&rsquo;s skills needs in the period to 2030. \u00a0A Construction Sector Working Group\u00a0has also been\u00a0established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector in relation to issues that may impact on the successful delivery of the National Development Plan (NDP) on a value-for-money basis for the State.\u00a0Part of the Group's remit\u00a0is to consider the supply of necessary skills and enhancing the capacity of the sector to meet infrastructural priorities over the next decade.<\/p>  <p>  As a demand driven programme, the number of apprenticeship placements is determined by employers within the construction sector. In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low level of just 650 in 2010 to 3,398 in 2018.\u00a0 As of end November there were 3,300 new registrations on construction related apprenticeships, and these are forecast to increase further up to 2022. \u00a0\u00a0The range of apprenticeships on offer is also being expanded to meet the identified skill needs of the sector.\u00a0 Arising from the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s two calls for apprenticeship proposals, an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management was rolled out in 2019.\u00a0 Apprenticeships in scaffolding, quantity surveyor and roofing and cladding scaffolding and senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship are currently being developed into national apprenticeship programmes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Construction skills are also being targeted through Higher Education programmes, including Springboard, and through\u00a0further education and training programmes. In the area of Construction, there are 14 courses under Springboard+ 2019, providing for 374 places. To date 272 participants have enrolled in or accepted places on these courses. It is expected that this number will rise in the New Year as some of the approved course in the construction sector will not begin until the spring and others may have a second intake of students.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of upskilling the existing workforce, initiatives include the establishment of a dedicated NZEB Training centre in Wexford which is currently providing 10 NZEB training programmes to existing construction workers in areas such as plumbing, electrical, bricklaying, carpentry and plastering. \u00a0As of the end of October 2019, 322 people received NZEB training. In November 2019 the Skillnet Ireland board approved the awarding of funding to a new Skillnet named the Construction Professional Skillnet which will be promoted by the Construction Industry Federation. This network will seek to improve competitiveness of the industry through upskilling the workforce, and create talent pipelines by developing resilience, core competencies and accessible progression opportunities to a predominantly young workforce.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent review of the employment permits occupations lists concluded on 12th July with 34 submissions of proposals for adjustments, 8 of which were from the construction sector including CIF.

The 'Take the First Step' campaign helps to break down apprehension that may be felt by some older individuals returning to education. The campaign is funded by SOLAS and\u00a0delivered by NALA, the National\u00a0Adult Literacy\u00a0Agency. \u00a0Surveys are conducted each year the campaign runs, and are\u00a0published in evaluation reports. The evaluations\u00a0found that awareness in general increases with age, from 29% of 18-24 year olds, to 63% of 65+ year olds, highlighting the campaign&rsquo;s greater salience and impact with older age cohorts.<\/p>  <p>  Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are requested, by SOLAS, to consider how the needs of priority cohorts are being addressed, including the development of appropriate provision tailored to the needs of older workers. \u00a0As evidenced by the statistics available, FET is for all ages: in 2018, there were 1,800 learners who were 80 years of age and older. More than 100 learners were over 90.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises that, for older workers to remain in the workforce, they may need education and training interventions. Employers, in particular in SMEs, will require support to identify and address the skills needs of employees, including those who are in the older age cohorts, who are engaged in lower skilled work. SOLAS, together with the ETBs, is addressing this through the Skills to Advance and Skills for Work programmes,\u00a0which both\u00a0provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities to vulnerable workers.<\/p>  <p>  SOLAS also\u00a0provides grant funding to Age Action Ireland for the purposes of promoting the active involvement of older people in lifelong learning through the development of personal, social and related skills in areas ranging from IT classes to physical activity programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700063#WRH06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions Redress Scheme","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700064#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[53072\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700064#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on sealing the records of the Ryan Commission for 75 years; if he or his officials have met with survivors of industrial schools that are of the view this would be tantamount to the legally sanctioned silencing of victims of institutionalisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>My Department and I have received correspondence in relation to the Retention of Records Bill from a number of former residents and it is clear that there are conflicting views as to how to procced in regard to the records.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. <\/p>  <p>  The Wexford school planning area which is currently served by five post-primary schools. Loreto College, Wexford which formed part of the Schools Bundle 5 PPP project, was completed in August 2018 and provides for 900 post-primary places.

As a result the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.<\/p><p>The majority of children with Autism attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.<\/p><p>Special classes enable students with more complex special educational needs who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. <\/p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.<\/p><p>The responsibility to ensure that all children with Special education needs can get a school placement is a shared responsibility involving the NCSE, schools management and Patrons, the education partners and my Department. However in the first instance this responsibility rests with individual schools boards of management. <\/p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide and has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. <\/p><p>The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  <\/p><p>It is open to any school including special schools to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, there is a range of supports including capital funding available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.<\/p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.  Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.<\/p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.<\/p><p>The NCSE has a team of local Special Education Needs Organisers who are available to provide parents with information about the supports that can be provided for children with special educational needs in schools and can also advise parents of the availability of special class placements in schools.<\/p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing. <\/p><p>The extent of new special class and school places being established in recent years shows the willingness of schools to provide special classes and school places and normally this is the case.<\/p><p>However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  <\/p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.<\/p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. <\/p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.<\/p><p>The legislation was activated on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified a shortage of special school and special class places right across south Dublin.<\/p><p>The NCSE has identified 82 children needing special education school places for this or next year in south Dublin.<\/p><p>This is the second time the power under section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018) has been used.<\/p><p>The law contains a procedure through which the NCSE can test the capacity of schools in an area to provide more special education places and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education places available.<\/p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that children with special needs are provided with access to a suitable education.<\/p><p>The legislation was used for the first time back in April in respect of the Dublin 15 area. <\/p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes. The new places will help these families and ensure that the children concerned have access to education. <\/p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.<\/p><p>I published the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill in September the Seanad Report Stage on the Bill is scheduled for this week. The aim of the legislation is to improve how schools engage with students and their parents. <\/p><p>Under the legislation, schools will be required to prepare and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines. The national charter guidelines will be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners, including those bodies representing students and parents. <\/p><p>The legislation provides that the charter guidelines will set out the requirements on schools in relation to the content of charters, including the procedures for consulting with students and their parents on the review and development of school plans and policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700064#WRJ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700064#WRJ05700"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[53193\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700064#WRJ05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if ASD units are automatically considered when schools require extensions;

The Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee is to be established no later than 3 months after the first meeting of the Judicial Council itself and that Committee is to meet no later than one month after its establishment. <\/p><p>On 28 November the Chief Justice announced the membership of the Personal Injuries Guidelines\u00a0Committee which is to be chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine.\u00a0 While the Committee cannot be formally established until the first meeting of the Judicial Council, a &ldquo;committee designate&rdquo;\u00a0 held its first meeting during the course of the week beginning 1 December to embark upon appropriate planning and preliminary work.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will be responsible for drawing up personal injuries guidelines for review and adoption by the Council.\u00a0 Section 18(4) of the Judicial Council Act 2019 provides that the &ldquo;Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee shall submit the first draft of personal injuries guidelines to the Board not later than 6 months after the date on which the Committee stands established.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The making of fraudulent and exaggerated claims has been the subject of much commentary recently. \u00a0The Government is working on a number of fronts to address the high costs insurers impose on their customers.\u00a0 In particular the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 will make the offence of perjury easier to prosecute.\u00a0 This will be particularly significant in the context of personal injury claims which contribute to the cost of insurance. I believe this will be strongly welcomed by the business community.<\/p><p>This Perjury Bill is a part of a package of measures dealing with insurance issues, insurance fraud and exaggerated claims. Of course it will also have general application in other areas. It will serve as a clear message to anyone engaged in legal proceedings that they need to be mindful of the need to tell the truth and that any deliberate departure from the truth may have serious consequences in terms of the level of sanctions and penalties that will be at the judge&rsquo;s discretion to impose. The Perjury Bill will serve to complement other Government legislative measures\u00a0by providing a deterrent effect against those who may seek to abuse the law through the making of fraudulent claims, statements or declarations including in relation to insurance claims.<\/p><p>The Perjury and Related Offences Bill was initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the end of 2018 by Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and passed all stages there in June 2019. The Government has adopted the Bill on its legislative programme to facilitate its passage through the D&aacute;il and it passed Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11 December 2019.<\/p><p>I would also refer to the steps taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area. I have discussed the matter of insurance fraud with the Garda Commissioner on several occasions and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been closely involved in the Government&rsquo;s drive to encourage insurers to reduce the costs imposed on consumers.\u00a0 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has regular meetings with Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to discuss and act upon current and ongoing issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud. <\/p><p>In October 2018, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published Guidelines for the Reporting of Allegations of Fraudulent Insurance Claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These Guidelines to make it clear what insurance companies should do in the event that they suspect fraud in a personal injuries claim. The Guidelines were also circulated to the Chief Justice and the judiciary.<\/p><p>A new insurance claim fraud category on the Garda PULSE system went live on 1 November 2018. <\/p><p>Operation Coatee was established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in April to tackle insurance related criminality and bogus insurance claims. Its focus is the prevention of insurance-related fraud and associated crimes on a coordinated basis throughout Ireland. In circumstances where insurance fraud has already occurred, Operation Coatee is designed to maximise the prospect of identifying suspected culprits, and, where possible and appropriate, to initiate criminal proceedings. <\/p><p>Furthermore, having given the matter careful consideration, the Garda Commissioner has decided that there will be a divisional focus on insurance fraud, aligned with the divisional-focused Garda model.\u00a0 The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide all Garda divisions in the investigation of suspected crimes and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.<\/p><p>The Table below\u00a0shows the Primary and Secondary legislation progressed in this area\u00a0since 2016. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year\u00a0<\/th>       <th>Primary Legislation<\/th>       <th>Secondary Legislation\u00a0<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>None\u00a0<\/td>       <td>None\u00a0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>None\u00a0<\/td>       <td>None<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>Section 13 of the Central Bank(National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 amending sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>None\u00a0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>Circuit Court Rules (Personal Injuries: Section 8 Notices) 2019 (S.I.

The report provides a snapshot of the extent to which crimes reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018 have been detected.\u00a0 Detection is understood in this context as identification and sanction of at least one suspected offender; or, in a very limited set of circumstances, a verified exception whereby an offender is not directly sanctioned because, for example, the DPP decides that prosecution is not in the public interest or the suspected offender dies prior to any prosecution.<\/p><p>In publishing this report, the CSO explicitly confirmed that the report constituted a 'significant break' in the previous series for measuring crime detection rates in Ireland.

The law in this area was most recently amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which amended the Licensing Acts and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 with the aim of reducing access to alcohol and at the same time strengthening measures to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The sale of alcohol products to underage persons is prohibited under licensing law. It is an offence under section 31(2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, for a licence holder to sell or deliver, or permit another person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years of age. This applies equally to premises with off-licences, including supermarkets, convenience stores and similar outlets, and those with on-licences such as public houses, hotels and nightclubs. On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between two and seven days will be imposed by the court, together with a fine of up to &euro;3,000. The penalties for a second or subsequent offence is a closure order of between seven and\u00a0thirty days and a fine of up to &euro;5,000. In addition, the licence holder is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, under section 32 of the 1988 Act, as amended, it is an offence for a person to purchase intoxicating liquor for delivery to, or consumption by, a person under the age of 18 years or to deliver intoxicating liquor to such a person. Under section 33 of the 1988 Act, as amended, it is also illegal for a person under 18 years to buy intoxicating liquor or to consume it in any place outside their home or in another person's home where they are present by right or with permission.<\/p>  <p>  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 also provides the Garda&iacute; with significant additional powers to address the problem of alcohol sales to persons under the age of 18 years. Section 14 contains provisions which allow a Garda who believes with reasonable cause that a person is under 18 years and that he or she, or anyone accompanying that person, is in possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of consuming it in a place other than a private dwelling, to seek an explanation and if not satisfied with the reply, the Garda may seize the intoxicating liquor if it is not handed over voluntarily. <\/p>  <p>  Section 14 of the 2008 Act also makes provision for the test purchasing of alcohol products. The primary objective of the scheme, which entered into force on 1 October 2010, is to enable the Garda&iacute; to target those licensed premises which are suspected of engaging in illegal sales to young people. This scheme provides the Garda&iacute; with an additional instrument in its overall enforcement strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda national age card scheme is an important proof-of-age mechanism in respect of the sale of intoxicating liquor. The scheme is administered by the Garda&iacute; and it has, in co-operation with the licensed trade, helped to combat underage consumption of intoxicating liquor. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which was amended by the 2008 Act, also permits the Garda&iacute; to seize bottles or containers containing intoxicating liquor where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner. Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour arising from excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor are investigated by the Garda&iacute; and dealt with in an appropriate manner, including by caution, fixed charge penalty notices or commencement of proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  In the area of public health, the overarching objectives of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 are to reduce alcohol consumption and to address alcohol misuse. It includes a number of provisions containing restrictions on the content, placement and volume of alcohol advertising. The aim of these restrictions includes the protection of children from exposure to alcohol advertising and to break positive associations between alcohol and social or sporting success.

It\u00a0is a central theme of the new National Standards for accommodation centres which Minister\u00a0Flanagan and I launched in August.\u00a0 Indeed, \u00a0in\u00a0recent weeks we have seen some new accommodation centres open\u00a0in Borrisokane and Ballinamore where families seeking international protection have been provided with own-door, self-catering accommodation in accordance with the new National Standards.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new Standards also contain specific actions to improve the lives of children in accommodation centres.\u00a0 Children and their parents or guardians living in accommodation centres have access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children.

It does not apply to cases where the applicant is the applicant\/plaintiff in proceedings against the Agency pursuant to parts of the Child Care Act other than parts III and IV (except where such applications are ancillary to the defence of the main child care proceedings) e.g. for access to children in care.<\/p>  <p>  From the 1st of January, 2018 persons seeking civil legal aid in domestic violence cases in the District Court were no longer required to pay a contribution.\u00a0Applicants for legal aid to assist with a claim for international protection only need to pay a contribution of &euro;10.<\/p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board can waive the contribution in cases of undue hardship.\u00a0 The Legal Aid Board\u00a0can recover the costs it incurred in providing legal aid in the event that money or real property is recovered or preserved on the legally aided person&rsquo;s behalf arising from legal proceedings. Again this can be waived in cases of hardship.<\/p>  <p>  In the District Court the vast majority of private family law cases are currently referred out to private solicitors and are not kept waiting, particularly if they have court cases pending.<\/p>  <p>  In the Circuit Court, the majority of family law cases (almost all of which are divorce and judicial separation cases) are handled within the law centres. Due to demand and budgetary constraints, legal aid applicants involved in these cases may have to wait for a first appointment with a solicitor.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the service provided, once a person is financially eligible for legal aid and is granted a legal aid certificate, the solicitor is required to deliver a full representation service to the end of the case.<\/p>  <p>  In law centres where waiting times are persistently long the Board may introduce an early advice only service so clients obtain timely advice about their legal rights while waiting for representation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700067#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Legislation","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700067#WRM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[53235\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700067#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the nature of the representations received from persons involved in private members clubs; the responses he or the Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Equality and Immigration have made to such representations (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1276","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019 has now passed all stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  An association of private members clubs (PMCs) made a number of representations to me in the course of the final development of the Bill.

We are now progressing these recommendations through\u00a0a high level implementation plan: &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo;. <\/p>  <p>  A key recommendation is the introduction of new legislation which, among other matters, should redefine policing to include prevention of harm.\u00a0 However, it also recognises that prevention of harm is not solely a policing matter.\u00a0\u00a0 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other body within or outside the criminal justice system cannot, acting alone, provide the required response.\u00a0 The report &ldquo;Building Community Resilience&rdquo; highlights the importance of developing a holistic approach to crime problems at a community level and it is this type of holistic approach with inclusion and involvement of the community that has been adopted in the North East Inner City in addressing issues in that part of the city.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  That said it requires a considerable commitment from across Government and beyond, including from those in our communities, to deliver.\u00a0 My Department is developing a policy focused on the concept of community safety with real cooperation between the range of actors involved in harm prevention in partnership with our communities.\u00a0 The community safety policy will seek to deliver on these goals by strengthening the way agencies work together and work with communities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Community safety is about being safe and feeling safe.\u00a0 There are many reasons why someone might not feel safe and I want to ensure the Deputy that there is a coherent system in place to tackle the range of issues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Policing and Community Safety Bill being drafted by my Department will redefine policing to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable and place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety.

This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has secured Dormant Account Funding a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, and I understand that arrangements in that regard are being finalised currently.<\/p>  <p>  Education programmes and education welfare services are the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla respectively.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Other initiatives to protect, prevent and free\u00a0vulnerable children from\u00a0recruitment into gangs include the Garda Youth Diversion Programme. This\u00a0is a statutory programme under Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which focuses on preventing criminal behaviour as well as diversion from the criminal justice system and rehabilitation of children between 10 and 18 years of age.\u00a0 The programme is an essential part of Government strategy to help tackle youth crime, administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it is very important that it operates effectively. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly supported by a nationwide network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects, which are funded by this Department and operated by community-based organisations.\u00a0\u00a0The projects receive referrals from a number of sources, but primarily from the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Other developments in the operation of GYDPs include ongoing initiatives relating to personal mentoring, employment support and restorative practices. There is also important work to enhance service standards, including formal risk assessment of children referred.<\/p>  <p>  In the last year, the operation of GYDPs has been the subject of extensive consultation with service providers and community stakeholders. The intention is to devise an ongoing programme of development, backed up by evidence of effectiveness, which will ensure that high-quality GYDP services are available to every child in the State who could benefit from them. It is intended to support this process with an Action Research Project, working with selected GYDPs, to describe and clarify key actions and strategies to enhance the effectiveness of local projects.<\/p>  <p>  Garda Youth Diversion Projects are co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Social Fund as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to\u00a0be aware that an expert Steering Group is currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, including a review of the Children Act. The Steering Group commenced its work in February and has had a series of meetings during this year which will continue into next year. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Group is tasked with advising and guiding the development of the new Strategy, including consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, from early intervention and preventative work, including family support, diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.\u00a0 It is intended that the Strategy will be finalised in the first half of 2020. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the operation of the Garda Diversion Programme is monitored by a Committee established under Section 44 of the Children Act 2001, whose annual reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand that the\u00a02018 Report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700067#WRM05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organised Crime","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700067#WRM05600"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[53278\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700067#WRM05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to develop an inter-agency model involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Probation Service and the Revenue Commissioners to profile and target career criminals that are alleged local senior criminals at the highest levels within their communities but do not have many criminal convictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>Tackling organised crime, and targeting those involved in it, is an ongoing priority for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>Multi-disciplinary approaches are used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminality are effectively targeted.

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs\u00a0by\u00a0depriving them of ill-gotten assets.<\/p><p>Officers of the Bureau\u00a0are comprised of\u00a0members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Officers of the Revenue Commissioners and Officers of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.\u00a0Its structure and powers\u00a0have\u00a0been modelled by other jurisdictions.\u00a0It works closely with\u00a0law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and\u00a0continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime\u00a0won't be tolerated. CAB has been allocated the resources necessary to ensure its effectiveness and the recent expansion and development of the Divisional Asset Profiler Network now includes some 378 trained profilers throughout the State. These are key local level personnel who support the development and progress of investigations.<\/p><p>The Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) programme is a strategic offender management initiative led by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service with active support and engagement of my own Department. It aims to develop and strengthen a multi-agency approach to the management of prolific offenders; prioritise such offenders for targeted interventions and supports to address their behaviour and through this work reduce crime and victimisation in local communities.\u00a0 An initial evaluation into the effectiveness of this programme was\u00a0carried out in 2018 and\u00a0has shown very promising evidence that it is an effective approach for such offenders.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I am open to considering any other specific recommendations that the Deputy or others would like to put forward for new approaches to tackling the issues raised. <\/p><p>Finally, it is important to say that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being provided with record investment to ensure it is adequately resourced to effectively tackle organised crime. &euro;1.76 bullion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, and this is increasing to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for 2020. Supported by these record investments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation with over 14,300 Garda&iacute; nationwide supported by over 2,900 Garda staff.

This is\u00a0reflected in\u00a0Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland, which is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force.<\/p><p>A deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working, which was published by my Department on 6<sup>th<\/sup>December 2019. The objective of this research was to understand the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce, the attitudes towards such arrangements and the influencing factors for both employers and employees when considering remote work.<\/p><p>The Remote Work in Ireland report\u00a0includes the outcomes from desk research, quantitative research and engagement with key stakeholders, including employer representative bodies and remote working interest groups. The report also includes an international policy review which considers relevant policies abroad. <\/p><p>One of the key implications for remote working in Ireland identified in this report is the need for guidance. Multiple stakeholder groups identified the absence of official guidelines for employers, employees and human resource professionals on the topic of remote work. As a result, many are unclear on how to manage the various aspects of what remote work entails. The main areas of importance\u00a0highlighted in the research are:<\/p><p>- <b>Equality<\/b>&ndash;\u00a0Fair and objective grounds for responding to a remote working request.<\/p><p>- <b>Health and Safety<\/b>&ndash; Topics of work-related accidents, balancing risk assessments with an employees&rsquo; privacy and clear procedures regarding bullying and workplace harassment when an employee is working from a hub or co-working space.<\/p><p>- <b>Employment Conditions <\/b>&ndash; Increased clarity and support in balancing\u00a0employees&rsquo; right to privacy and the practical elements of performance measurement and monitoring working hours. <\/p><p>- <b>Data Protection<\/b>&ndash; Balancing data security and cybersecurity when engaging in remote work, particularly given GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, which offers enhanced privacy protection rights to individuals\u00a0in relation to the processing of their personal data.<\/p><p>- <b>Training<\/b>&ndash; Training for employees working remotely and for managers in managing distributed teams.<\/p><p>To build on the\u00a0areas of importance outlined above, Future Jobs Ireland 2020 will commit to the establishment of an Interdepartmental Group comprising relevant departments\u00a0and agencies to align approach and develop clear guidance for employers and workers on\u00a0key aspects of remote work.

Officials have also\u00a0put together Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme information packs, which are available through this website. These sit alongside publications like the Quick Brexit Guide for Business and Currency Risk Management for Irish SMEs.<\/p><p>To raise awareness among Irish businesses of the suite of Government supports available to the, in July this year\u00a0my Department published a report detailing the supports available to indigenous enterprises, including Brexit supports such as the Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme and disseminates this at events, through the enterprise agencies, and through industry representative bodies. \u00a0<\/p><p>As of 6 December, there have been 6,763 participants at the Brexit\u00a0Information LEO events and 5,402 SMEs have directly engaged with the InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service in 2019. This is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018.<\/p><p>A recent survey of SMEs, which was undertaken by my Department, indicates that businesses are increasingly aware of and preparing for Brexit, with 77% of SMEs discussing Brexit at management level.<\/p><p>Brexit was central to my decision-making in the allocation of the additional &euro;14.2m Current and &euro;65m Capital funding I secured as part of Budget 2019. <\/p><p>In 2019 for example, I provided an additional &euro;5m to the network of Local Enterprise Offices, &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2m to IDA Ireland and &euro;1m to InterTradeIreland\u00a0to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme and the IDA Regional Property Programme.\u00a0\u00a0I also provided extra staff for regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.<\/p><p>Local Enterprise Office (LEO) funding was increased by 22% in 2019, and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The LEOs, which have a presence in every county,\u00a0are working with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed about Brexit\u00a0and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.<\/p><p>To enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business, I introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme in 2018 administered by Enterprise Ireland. The scheme, with a fund of up to &euro;1.25m over two calls, provided funding to 40 retailers across Ireland, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 percent match fund basis. This scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. The Pilot Online Retail Scheme concluded this year and my Department and Enterprise Ireland will review its effectiveness. <\/p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland (ITI) was increased by 18% between 2018 and 2019 and it, along with the LEOs, is offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to businesses, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.\u00a0 ITI offers a Brexit Planning Voucher worth up to &euro;2,250, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. In March, it launched a Brexit Implementation Voucher,\u00a0which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with\u00a0ITI paying 50% of total expenditure. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship. <\/p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million &ndash; &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for applications through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in April of 2019. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by my Department (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million. <\/p><p>The results from the UK election held on\u00a012 of December 2019 present a further evolution of the Brexit context, and the Government and my Department are ready to support businesses, however events unfold.<\/p><p>In the coming year, I will continue to focus on proactively responding to the ongoing challenges presented by Brexit and be prepared for all Brexit scenarios. <\/p><p>The definitive allocations for my Department for the year 2020 will be determined as part of the normal estimates process, and the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume is set to be finalised and published in the coming days.<\/p><p>However, I can say at this point that compared to the 2019 allocation an additional &euro;8.8m in current expenditure and &euro;12m in capital expenditure is being allocated in 2020. The increase to the Department&rsquo;s current expenditure will allow for additional resources to be provided to my Department&rsquo;s regulatory bodies and its enterprise agencies to continue to prepare for Brexit, in whatever form it may take, by expanding and further developing the suite of available supports and by progressing the Global Footprint Initiative.<\/p><p>The first table\u00a0sets out the uptake of Brexit preparedness supports available through\u00a0my Department and its agencies as at\u00a06 of December, 2019.<\/p><p>The second table sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019, and the cost\/expenditure of Brexit-related supports to date.

The scoping of a future cycle of PRTLI has been undertaken by my Department, working with the Department of Education and Skills (DES). <\/p>  <p>  While future cycles of PRTLI are referenced in the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040, it is important to note that actions are already being taken by DBEI and DES to fund all of the key elements that had been encompassed by PRTLI including research buildings, equipment and structured PhD programmes.\u00a0 These actions include:<\/p>  <p>  - My Department, through Science Foundation Ireland, has allocated circa &euro;75m for research equipment across the higher education system since the start of 2016, providing significant additional investment for research equipment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - My Department, again through Science Foundation Ireland, has commenced roll-out of a new &euro;100 million programmes of investment in PhDs and Research Masters through new Centres for Research Training (CRT). The annual budget for this programme increased to &euro;15 million this year. The CRT programme will provide training for cohorts of Research Masters and PhD students with new cohorts of students enrolling each year for four years from 2019. It will provide training for 700 postgraduate students in areas of nationally and internationally identified future skills needs of digital, data and ICT. The first intake of 126 students commenced in September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  - As regards buildings, under Project Ireland 2040, &euro;2.2 billion has been earmarked for higher education infrastructure over the period 2018-2027.\u00a0 This spending by the Department of Education and Skills will be focused on expanding capacity and upgrading existing infrastructure, as in other sectors, the funding increase will be gradual during the first half of the period.\u00a0 Funding programmes include the Higher Education Strategic Infrastructure Fund which has five major projects and the Higher Education PPP programme, which incorporates eleven projects across the Institute of Technology\/Technological University sector.\u00a0 It also includes the funding of certain research activities, most notably by the Irish Research Council.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The actions being taken by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills are addressing to a significant degree the requirements for increased investment in both physical infrastructure and human capital in higher education research as identified in Innovation 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700069#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":726,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[53301\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700069#WRO02100","dept":"Department

The strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural, and family life in their own communities for as long as possible. The strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic, and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the objectives included in this Strategy are broad and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people  into the future.<\/p>  <p>  New arrangements to implement and monitor implementation of NPAS were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in 2016. The revised approach recommits to the core principles of the strategy, establishes a mechanism to give stakeholder groups effective and ongoing access to engagement with bodies and agencies relevant to older people through an annual forum for stakeholders, and monitors the effect of the implementation process through the publication on a regular basis of a Positive Ageing National Indicators Report. <\/p>  <p>  The inaugural stakeholder forum took place in 2017. Stakeholders were asked to identify key priorities to propose to Government to consider for its focus in the coming year. Through this forum, clear channels of communication between the stakeholder representative group and relevant Government Departments to discuss these priorities have been facilitated by the Department of Health. Based on the success of and interest in the forum, a second stakeholder forum was held in 2018 and the third stakeholder forum was held in November 2019. Areas of action have been identified at each of these fora and the Department is providing support and communication to stakeholder groups who are engaged in furthering work in these areas, with positive outcomes to date, including collaborative work in relation to the redesign of housing adaptation grant application forms.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy comprises four national goals, developed to address key aspects of older people&rsquo;s lives. The four goals, and examples of progress to date thereunder, follow.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 1:<\/p>  <p>  Remove barriers to participation and provide more opportunities for the continued involvement of people as they age in all aspects of cultural, economic, and social life in their communities according to their needs, preferences, and capacities.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective under this goal is to promote the concept of active citizenship and to encourage people of all ages to become more involved in their communities. Age Friendly, an organisation whose remit it is to help to create an inclusive, equitable society in which older people can live full, active, valued, and healthy lives under the guidance of the National Positive Ageing Strategy, have been very successful to date in this area. Age Friendly is a World Health Organisation inspired movement which embraces the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population. In Ireland each of the 31 local authorities have signed up to the Age Friendly Programme. Older People&rsquo;s Councils have been set up and are running throughout Ireland as part of this programme, as well, ensuring a voice for older people in local government and community concerns. Implementation on this front does not rest with Age Friendly alone; there are many NGOs engaged in making Ireland a better country in which to grow old and they do so with the objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy informing their work.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 2:<\/p>  <p>  Support people as they age to maintain, improve, or manage their physical and mental health and wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  The National Positive Ageing Strategy is strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health, and where wellbeing is supported at every level of society. The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with accurate information on how to improve their health and wellbeing and to make the healthy choices easier choices. Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and wellbeing and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate.<\/p>  <p>  Commitments within Government that further the strategy in relation to health and wellbeing include the development of a statutory scheme for homecare, which will aim to improve access to the homecare services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way, thus enabling people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 3:<\/p>  <p>  Enable people to age with confidence, security, and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Across communities many initiatives, strategies, and schemes are in place that firmly support this goal. One such is initiative is the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Older People Strategy, which aims to ensure the policing needs of older people in Ireland are met to the highest standards. This supports the objective of empowering people to live free from fear in their homes and communities, as they age. With regards to facilitating older people to live in homes which are suitable to their physical and social needs, the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government and the Department of Health are implementing, through a Joint Committee on Housing and Health, a framework for supported housing, to facilitate people to age well and healthily in place.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 4:<\/p>  <p>  Support and use research about people as they age to better inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the strategy implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the strategy and establish an on-going system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing. The Initiative monitors changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. This is done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators which are published every two years. The initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland. The first Positive Ageing National Indicators Report was published in November 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland. The second Positive Ageing National Indicators report is due to be published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding to many organisations that work with older people and further the objectives of the strategy. This funding is ongoing by its nature, as the strategy and the goals therein are intended as direction for future engagement for the continued promotion of older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700069#WRO05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","counter":760,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700069#WRO05700"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[52552\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700069#WRO05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of advanced nurse practitioner posts filled at University Hospital Kerry; the number of posts filled in each of the years 2016 to 2018; his plans for 2020 in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":762,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700069#WRO05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmaceutical Sector","counter":764,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700070#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":765,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[52553\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700070#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to safeguard rural pharmacies against planned fee changes due to come into affect in January 2020; and if the planned fee changes will be postponed until negotiations with the pharmacy sector are concluded in view of the commitment given to the negotiations.","asker":"1266","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":766,"content":"<p>I recognise the significant role community pharmacists play in the delivery of patient care and the potential for this role to be developed further in the context of health service reform and modernisation.

I also intend to regulate\u00a0price-based promotions of alcohol products in the future so as ensure that these products become less affordable for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":848,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":849,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[52733\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which out-of-hours responses for general adult mental health services have been expanded to date in 2019 by moving to the 7-7 model; the number of new staff appointed in each CHO area, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":850,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":851,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":852,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[52734\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which out-of-hours responses for child and adolescent mental health services have been expanded to date in 2019 by moving to the 7-7 model; the timeline for full transition to a 7\/7 model for CAMHS; the details of CAMHS services in each CHO that provide 7-7 services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":853,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":855,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[52737\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700071#WRQ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if parents and guardians will be reimbursed for private health spending undertaken as a direct result of the lengthy waiting list times experienced by children with delayed language skills awaiting access to necessary therapies","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":856,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

It is important that this is completed in sufficient detail for therapeutic benefit to be demonstrated. <\/p><p>-  The Individual Reimbursement Form is considered by the Medicines Management Programme (MMP). <\/p><p>-  On review of the documentation, the MMP makes a recommendation for or against reimbursement support for the patient to the HSE, under the patient's eligibility, and informs the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) of that recommendation. <\/p><p>If approval is given, the PCRS, when authorised to proceed, will make the necessary arrangements to cover the costs involved for the patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1020,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1021,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[53027\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a project (details supplied); the timeframe for commencement of a service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1022,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1023,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1024,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[53034\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the policy in relation to girls who missed out on the provision of vaccines for medical reasons (details supplied).","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1025,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter concerning an individual, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Decision Making","counter":1026,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1027,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[53047\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700074#WRT02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department is preparing regulations for the institution of a register of advance healthcare directives to allow for commencement of Part 8 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1028,"content":"<p>Part 8 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives (AHDs).

My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan 2019\/2020 was launched by the HSE on Thursday 14 November 2019. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period. The increased pressures include a prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections. <\/p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams (WAT), each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) and associated Acute Hospital and Hospital Group (HG), have prepared Integrated Winter Plans that will focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  These Integrated Winter Plans have supported the development of a single overarching strategic level Winter Plan for the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plan for Portiuncula Hospital will be delivered by Winter Action Team 2 (WAT 2), whose membership includes the CEO of the Saolta University Healthcare Group, the Chief Officer of CHO West, and the CEO of Portiuncula Hospital. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding available nationally. This is being used to relieve demand for ED services, support discharge and other initiatives to help hospitals deal with the challenges associated with winter. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, the winter funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme and the availability of home care, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to both facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period. \u00a0Specific funding has also been allocated to the Winter Action Teams to support initiatives at local level. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy is addressing the issues of access to healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019 has a specific workstream on access and waiting lists. The Government is also increasing investment in health infrastructure and capacity in the system in line with Project Ireland 2040. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the Emergency Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700077#WRW04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700077#WRW05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1228,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[53398\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700077#WRW05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a treatment placement in the UK will be funded in a relevant placement for a person (details supplied);

The sectors\u00a0targeted were areas for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector, namely horticulture, cereals and dairy.

I subsequently established the Forestry Appeals Committee in February 2018.  The Committee operates independently of my Department, although the remit of the Agriculture Appeals Office was extended in to provide all administrative and secretariat support for the Forestry Appeals Committee. <\/p><p>Three additional administrative staff were recently assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload. Resource requirements are monitored on an on-going basis.  The Committee membership includes eleven Appeals Officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office and an external Chairperson.  The legislation provides that the Chairperson and any two ordinary members of the Committee may hear an appeal.  The Committee commenced hearing appeals in March 2018.  <\/p><p>The number of appeals to the Forestry Appeals Committee has risen from 35 in 2017 to just under 200 in 2018 and to 250 in the first 7 months of 2019. These appeals are almost exclusively from third parties.  A decision on a license may be the subject of multiple appeals. <\/p><p>My Department deals with applications for felling licences independently of the appeals process for Forestry Appals Committee.  Applications for licences are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Each application is considered regarding its effect on the surrounding countryside, environment and particularly for its likely impact on any sites designated for conservation proximate to the proposed forestry site, known as Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  The majority of appeals have been in respect of the AAP.<\/p><p>My Department endeavours to issue decisions on forestry licences within four months of receipt of a completed application for a licence, but this may not be possible due to the particulars of the site or the number of licence applications received at any time.  Recent changes to AAP designed to take account of recent case law have given rise to delays in processing licence applications, while the new procedures are being put in place.<\/p><p>These AA procedures have been amended to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involved the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  My Department has also concluded a recruitment competition for two new ecologists who are expected to start work within the Department shortly.  Forestry district inspectors have undergone training and are continuing to receive support in delivering the new procedures.

I subsequently established the Forestry Appeals Committee in February 2018.  The Committee operates independently of my Department, although the remit of the Agriculture Appeals Office was extended in to provide all administrative and secretariat support for the Forestry Appeals Committee. Three additional administrative staff were  recently assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload. Resource requirements are monitored on an on-going basis.  The Committee membership includes eleven Appeals Officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office and an external Chairperson.  The legislation provides that the Chairperson and any two ordinary members of the Committee may hear an appeal.  The Committee commenced hearing appeals in March 2018.  <\/p><p>The number of appeals to the Forestry Appeals Committee has risen from 35 in 2017 to just under 200 in 2018 and to 250 in the first 7 months of 2019. These appeals are almost exclusively from third parties. A decision on a license may be the subject of multiple appeals. <\/p><p>My Department deals with applications for felling licences independently of the appeals process for Forestry Appals Committee.  Applications for licences are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Each application is considered regarding its effect on the surrounding countryside, environment and particularly for its likely impact on any sites designated for conservation proximate to the proposed forestry site, known as Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  The majority of appeals are in respect of the AAP.<\/p><p>My Department endeavours to issue decisions on forestry licences within four months of receipt of a completed application for a licence, but this may not be possible due to the particulars of the site or the number of licence applications received at any time.  Recent changes to AAP designed to take account of recent case law have given rise to delays in processing licence applications, while the new procedures are being put in place.<\/p><p>These AA procedures have been amended to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involved the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  Interviews are taking place for additional ecologists under a recently advertised competition and I expect the successful candidates will be deployed early in the new year.  Forestry district inspectors have undergone training and are continuing to receive support in delivering the new procedures.  A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom.

In addition there is a fee for overstaying at a fast charger. The ESB have indicated that they also intend to introduce fees for the use of standard chargers (generally located on streets and in car parks) in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The fees for use of fast chargers is in keeping with the recommendations of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce which set out that home charging should be the most cost-effective method of charging, followed by on-street public charging and then fast charging &ndash; with fast charging no more expensive than the cost of fuelling a conventionally powered vehicle for the same journey. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of fees will encourage further investment in charging infrastructure, ensure consumers are incentivised to charge at home and avoid overstaying at fast chargers. Electric vehicle owners, including the Irish Electric Vehicle Owners Association, have been broadly supportive of the ESB's introduction of fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700081#WRAA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Biofuel Obligation Scheme","counter":1432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700081#WRAA02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1433,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[52690\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700081#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the percentage of biofuel in petrol, diesel and other carbon oils; the targets regarding these percentages; the reason other countries have much higher targets; and the steps the EU is taking with regard to vehicle manufacturers supporting the movement towards high percentage biofuel blends.","asker":"1361","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1434,"content":"<p>The Biofuels Obligation Scheme is the primary method by which the use of biofuels is supported in Ireland.

The Scheme was introduced to encourage private and commercial car\/van users who regularly travel tolled roads to consider switching to an electric alternative. It was estimated that there were approximately 400,000 heavy toll users in Ireland and so a reduced tolling incentive\u00a0does act as a meaningful inducement for a large number of vehicle owners.<\/p>  <p>  Under the EVTI Scheme, which is administered by Transport Infrastructure Ireland on behalf of my Department, full battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles qualify for a 50% and 25% toll reduction respectively, up to a maximum annual threshold of &euro;500 for private vehicles and &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles. Greater off-peak reductions also apply to the M50 toll. <\/p>  <p>  As of the end of November 2019, 8,476 electric vehicles have registered under the EVTI Scheme; this represents 56% of the total number of electric vehicles under taxation in Ireland. The uptake rate is considered\u00a0high in light of the fact that many of the toll roads in Ireland are located in the South and East of the country while electric vehicle ownership\u00a0has a\u00a0wider geographic distribution. To date, registered vehicles have made over 615,000 discounted tolled journeys. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0was delighted to announce\u00a0an expansion\u00a0to the EVTI Scheme for 2020. From January, the maximum annual threshold for small public service vehicles (taxis, hackneys and limousines) will be extended to &euro;1,000 in line with other commercial vehicles. Additionally, a new reducing tolling incentive regime will be introduced for heavy duty vehicles exceeding 3,500kg, including buses and trucks, fuelled by compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, hydrogen or electricity. Heavy duty vehicles will be eligible for a toll refund of up to 50% to a maximum cap of &euro;1,000 per calendar year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query regarding account registration requirements, it is my understanding that vehicles participating in the Scheme must use a Toll Tag and\u00a0vehicle eligibility must\u00a0be approved by one of four Toll Service Providers. A monthly administration fee, up to a maximum of &euro;1.25 per month, is\u00a0applied to all toll tag\u00a0accounts; however, I am given to understand that there is no mandatory minimum account balance required by any of the Toll Service Providers to avail of the reduced EVTI toll charges. Nevertheless, due to the monthly account administration fee individual\u00a0electric vehicle\u00a0owners should determine, based on toll usage, the benefits of participating in the Scheme.\u00a0 The primary\u00a0focus of the EVTI Scheme is to encourage heavy toll users to transition away from fossil fuels; such users are generally already toll tag\/account holders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700082#WRBB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parking Provision","counter":1504,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700082#WRBB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1505,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[52739\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700082#WRBB03400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will consider a change to the eligibility criteria for a disabled parking permit in certain cases (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1506,"content":"<p>Under\u00a0the criteria laid\u00a0out in the Road Traffic (Traffic And Parking) Regulations, 1997, as amended, Disabled Parking Permits are available to an\u00a0individual with permanent conditions or disabilities that severely restrict\u00a0their ability to walk.\u00a0 Eligibility is thus defined on the basis of mobility impairment rather than on the basis of a specific medical condition.<\/p>  <p>  While\u00a0my Department keeps\u00a0the eligibility criteria under review, there are no plans to change them at this time.

The\u00a0Draft Childminding Action Plan is firmly based in the\u00a0Working Group's report, which was submitted to me last year.\u00a0The Working Group itself was chaired by Childminding Ireland, and\u00a0its work included an online\u00a0survey of childminders and parents, in which there were\u00a03,630 participants. <\/p>  <p>  While a significant amount of consultation has already taken place, the Draft Action Plan also commits to further consultation with childminders, parents and other stakeholders during development of regulations specific to the home environment, during Phase 1 of the Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The Draft Childminding Action Plan is very much about recognising and supporting all that is distinctive about childminding and about the home and family setting in which childminders work. The Draft Action Plan proposes to move away from the current situation in which childminders face the same regulations as centre-based providers, and proposes instead to develop new regulations that are specific and appropriate to childminding, and to develop bespoke training and resources to support the quality of childminding provision.<\/p>  <p>  With the completion of the consultation process, my officials will soon commence a process of consideration of all the feedback received from the various fora and methodologies. A final plan will then be brought for approval which will reflect the results of the extensive consultation exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700085#WREE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":1659,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700085#WREE01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1660,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[52662\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700085#WREE02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if Tusla is now using guidelines of one refuge space per 10,000 persons as opposed to 10,000 women; if a review of refuge spaces in the greater Dublin area is taking place; if so, when the results will be available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1661,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV). \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Council of Europe's document on minimum standards for support services for victims of domestic violence, \"Combating Violence Against Women: Minimum Standards for Support Services\" describes standards that apply to a range of services for victims, including the level of provision of shelter places.

Section 58G of the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) places an onus on the providers of early years services to ensure that they take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In August 2019, Tusla. as regulator,\u00a0issued guidance for registered providers of early years services on the fire and planning requirements for the re-registration and change in circumstances process. It is important to note that these were not new Regulations, but guidance on the submission of documentation for the purpose of re-registration.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Registration of Early Learning and Care settings is granted where Tusla is satisfied that the premises, operation and location of the setting poses no unmanaged risk to children. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties many providers were experiencing in completing re-registration, Tusla decided to revise the time-line for submission of some supporting documentation for re-registration. Under the revised arrangements, while providers were required to apply to Tusla by 12th December for re-registration, they have until 30th June 2020 to provide some of the supporting documentation required, including on fire safety and planning requirements.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While many services already have the necessary documentation in place, Tusla has been made aware that, in certain parts of the country, some providers were experiencing difficulties owing to a shortage of available professional persons to complete the required fire risk assessments. The extended deadline of 30th June 2020 for providing supporting documentation will allow providers to access the relevant professionals and get the required documentation in place.<\/p>  <p>  While the health and safety of children is the primary concern in decisions on the regulation of early learning and care services, I recognise that a balanced approach to the re-registration process was required, given difficulties some providers experienced in completing their applications. In that context, I fully support Tusla&rsquo;s decision.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of\u00a0addressing fire safety concerns cannot be underestimated. In recognition of this, my Department awarded &euro;330,000 of capital funding to community-based, non-profit services in 2019. This has helped to address fire safety issues that had been highlighted in inspection reports. A further, related round of capital funding will be provided in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Fire safety audits, fire safety legislation and compliance come under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. The Tusla Early Years Inspectorate liaises with Local Authority fire services where appropriate.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is available to answer questions from providers as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700085#WREE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":1677,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700085#WREE03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1678,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[52812\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700085#WREE03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children that left residential care in each year since 2016 due to ageing out; and the number assigned an aftercare worker.","asker":"1448","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1679,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to an operational matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

The survey outlines findings and analysis from data captured\u00a0in the Early Years&rsquo; Service Profile annual survey. For the programme year 2018\/2019, the survey was\u00a0completed by 85% of ELC and SAC services (3,821) between May and June 2019. Data is captured and reported at a local authority level. In addition to data on enrolments, fees and staffing, the survey captures data on spaces, capacity and waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  The report\u00a0estimated that there were 206,301 children attending ELC and SAC services during 2018\/19. This represents a 2% increase on the previous year. <\/p>  <p>  The number of vacant places increased by 13% this year to an estimated 12,444. While the number of vacant places for children aged over 3 years increased last year, this figure continued to decrease for younger children (up to 3 years old). The service profile includes a breakdown by local authority, with the highest number of vacancies recorded in Cork County, and the lowest number in Longford, followed by Roscommon. Waiting list figures were highest in Dublin City, and lowest in Laois.<\/p>  <p>  The overall estimated capacity was 218,745, representing an increase of 2% from last year. The growth in capacity is proportionate to the increase in the number of children enrolled (2%), indicating the proportion of vacant places remained the same. When combined with the increased numbers on waiting lists, these figures suggest more places need to be created in order to meet demand, especially for children up to 3 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these data, my Department also uses a range of official data sources to assess the demand for ELC and SAC places at a county level. Among these data are: population data and data on labour force participation from the Central Statistics Office, the main arrangements for ELC and SAC used by parents with children of different ages, and, in the case of the\u00a0ECCE Programme, data on school-starting age derived from the Pupil Online Database held by the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p>  These data combined inform priorities for the ELC and SAC Annual Capital Programme. This annual capital program is used to incentivise new places where they are required. For example, when ECCE was being increased from one year to two years and there was a need for extra places, the scheme focused on supporting the development of ECCE places. In 2019, it focused on under 3 places and school age childcare places.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and Their Families also identifies a commitment to design an enhanced research and data infrastructure which will provide quality data about early childhood. Among a range of relevant actions is a commitment to undertake research on the needs of parents who work atypical hours or live in rural communities and develop recommendations for future action and a commitment to\u00a0further strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand for ELC and SAC.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, access to high quality and affordable childcare has been identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan and &euro;250m has been committed for the period 2023-2028. In advance of this, a detailed research and planning exercise will be completed to identify the greatest priority for this investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":1708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1709,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[52863\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of full-time equivalent social workers employed on a permanent basis by Tusla in each year since 2014, in tabular form.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1710,"content":"<p>I wish to advise that my officials have asked Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1712,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[52864\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of full-time equivalent social workers employed on an agency basis by Tusla in each year since 2014, in tabular form.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1713,"content":"<p>I wish to advise that my officials have asked Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1715,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[52865\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of full-time equivalent social care workers employed on an agency basis by Tusla in each year since 2014, in tabular form.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1716,"content":"<p>I wish to advise that my officials have asked Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1718,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[52866\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of full-time equivalent social care workers on a permanent basis by Tusla in each year since 2014, in tabular form.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1719,"content":"<p>I wish to advise that my officials have asked Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Funding","counter":1720,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1721,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[52963\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the capital assistance available for the development and building of cr&egrave;ches; the amount spent each year since 2012 on capital assistance for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Community services access much of this growing investment. \u00a0Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes,\u00a0there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. My Department believes that our approach to compliance and\u00a0supporting services\u00a0strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach has been informed from a variety of sources, including audit reports which needed to be taken seriously. Our approach now involves setting out the rules very clearly for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I very much appreciate that settings, such as the ones referred to in the Deputy's question, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate the impact potentially reduced income, as a result of compliance visits, can have on their service, but, there are also opportunities that can be explored that will benefit children and the service. <\/p>  <p>  Significant support is available to service providers\u00a0to ensure\u00a0sustainability, whilst ensuring the necessary level of compliance with scheme rules. \u00a0My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system, operated by Pobal, through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Results from compliance visits during the 2018\/19 programme cycle showed high levels of non-compliance within the sector. Pobal, local City\/County Childcare Committees and officials in my Department have engaged with service providers to support them through this process and help them to become compliant. This has involved listening to the concerns expressed by service providers and interest groups through proactive engagement with the sector, sometimes\u00a0involving meetings with such groups. <\/p>  <p>  I, along with officials from my Department, met a group representing community services in the Carlow Kilkenny area, where I was able to hear their concerns first hand. Such meetings are valuable in building an understanding of the realities for services on the ground. During a compliance visit, Pobal, when determining what constitutes a pattern of attendance, aim to apply the rules in a manner which maximises the amount payable to providers. As such, while the rules link funding to attendance levels, flexibility is shown in the way those rules are applied.\u00a0Officials in my Department\u00a0continue to\u00a0review the link between compliance and sustainability, to ensure that it operates in an effective manner. As has been the case in 2018\/19, funding and repayment plans will be available for community services who are facing sustainability concerns in the 2019\/20 programme year.<\/p>  <p>  Compliance visits for the legacy programmes (CCSP, CCSU, CCSR(T), TEC) and ECCE have begun for the 2019\/20 programme year. My Department will once again be focused on balancing the responsibility to protect public monies with the need to support children, families and service providers. Along with the supports that were previously available, the National Childcare Scheme is also now open for families to access.<\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme is Ireland&rsquo;s pathway to quality, accessible, affordable ELC and SAC. The Scheme\u00a0replaces the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme, and\u00a0includes &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; care for pre-school and school-age children. The scheme seeks to address poverty traps that have been identified on a cross government basis. The demand for the scheme, covering almost 20,000 children in its first 4 weeks of operation, is positive. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme rules,\u00a0particularly the attendance rules, are designed to be flexible and responsive to family life. The rules recognise the business requirements of our dedicated childcare service providers, as well as the need to protect State finances and represent value for money for taxpayers. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme has marked another significant milestone for ELC and SAC in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families. First 5 also commits to a DEIS type model for early learning and care services in areas of disadvantage, and to exploring the extension of AIM beyond ECCE and disability. Both these commitments, and many others within First 5,\u00a0will have a positive impact on community services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges Provision","counter":1741,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1742,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[53219\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700086#WRFF04400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if a copy of a report (details supplied) produced in respect of the need for a facility will be provided; the action taken on the report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1743,"content":"<p>I have requested that Tusla,\u00a0the Child and Family Agency,\u00a0responds to you directly on this matter.<\/p><p>I am informed that Tusla has conducted\u00a0a\u00a0needs analysis project in the Carlow area, in conjunction with local stakeholders.<\/p><p>The allocation of outreach workers in\u00a0Carlow was prioritised in 2019, and funding was provided for this purpose.

need it.<\/p><p>It is important to note, however, that there has been a steady reduction of the severe material deprivation rate for single parents in Ireland over the period from 2012 to 2018, and the rate has more than halved from its high point of 32.3% in 2013.\u00a0 With the social welfare improvements in Budgets 2019 and 2020, this rate of reduction should continue to\u00a0move closer in line with the EU average.<\/p><p>Budget 2020 raised the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients to &euro;165 per week with effect from January 2020 (the highest disregard level to date).\u00a0 The weekly rates of the\u00a0Qualified Child\u00a0Allowance\u00a0in 2020 also increased by &euro;2 per week (from &euro;34\u00a0to &euro;36) for children under 12, and by &euro;3 per week (&euro;37 to\u00a0&euro;40) for children 12 and over.\u00a0 This measure will benefit an estimated 370,000 children and will help to further tackle child poverty. <\/p><p>Across Budgets 2017 to 2020,\u00a0 the Government increased maximum weekly welfare payments by &euro;15 per week with proportionate increases for qualified adult dependents; introduced a new qualified child rate for children over 12 years of age\u00a0and\u00a0increased weekly qualified child rates\u00a0by &euro;6.20 for children under 12 and &euro;10.60 for those over 12.\u00a0 There were also increases in the income thresholds for the Working Family Payment.<\/p><p>It can take some time for the full impact of budgetary measures to be reflected in data from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions.\u00a0 Given the continuing economic recovery and the measures introduced in recent Budgets, I expect to see the poverty data for 2019 and 2020, when they become available, to show further improvements over the 2018 outcomes.\u00a0 I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.<\/p><p><b>Severe Material deprivation rate: household type - Single Person with dependent children<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>2011<\/th>

matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1828,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.\u00a0<\/p><p>Appeals which had a favourable outcome for the appellant consist of appeals which were either allowed in full or in part by an Appeals Officer, or which were resolved by way of a revised decision in favour of the appellant by a Deciding Officer \/ Designated Person.<\/p><p>In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the Appeals Office continues to work to ensure that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was incorrect.\u00a0 It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person; this was the case in 37.6% of such successful outcomes in 2017, 31.5% of such outcomes in 2018 and 37.3% of such outcomes to the end of November 2019.<\/p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and, in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.\u00a0 In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.\u00a0 Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.\u00a0 It is expected that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time. \u00a0<\/p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.\u00a0 As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes generally improved between 2011 and 2017 from\u00a052.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017, and from 25.1 \u00a0weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.<\/p><p>Processing performance has in the past number of years been affected by a relatively large number of retirements in the office - although these staff have been replaced it takes time for a new Appeals Officer to reach full productivity.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the latest data show an improvement from 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.6 weeks for a summary decision in 2018 to 27.5 and 22.7 weeks respectively in 2019.\u00a0 Although this is still too long additional resources have been allocated to the Appeals Office with seven additional Appeals Officers now in place compared to December 2018, and I am advised that this improvement will continue.<\/p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.\u00a0\u00a0If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.<\/p><p>The statistics required by the Deputy are set out in the following tables.<\/p><p>I trust this

It is hoped that this research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities from a whole-of-Government perspective and further reduce the rate of deprivation in the context of the European average. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, given the continuing economic recovery and the measures introduced in recent Budgets, I expect to see the poverty data for 2019 and 2020, when they become available, to show further improvements over the 2018 outcomes.\u00a0 I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700088#WRHH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1838,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700088#WRHH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1839,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[52947\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700088#WRHH02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the percentage of target dates and commitments met on time as set out in A roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 in terms of introducing the total contributions approach by Q3 of 2020; her views on whether this timeframe is realistic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1840,"content":"<p>\"A Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023\" was launched on the 28th February 2018.\u00a0 It contains six actions which will modernise Ireland's pension system while continuing to target resources at those most in need.\u00a0 Among those six strands was reform of the State Pension, including the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach (TCA)\u00a0for all pensioners.<\/p>  <p>  There\u00a0are three specific actions relating to the introduction of the Total Contributions Approach in the \"Table of Actions\" in the Roadmap.\u00a0 They were to prepare a proposal and begin a public consultation on the design of the scheme (by Q2 2018), and to bring forward necessary legislation to implement TCA by Q3 2020.<\/p>  <p>  A proposal was drafted and the public consultation began in May 2018.\u00a0 The consultation was open for more than three months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.\u00a0 Those submissions outlined the individual views of respondents on the issues of most interest to them.<\/p>  <p>  Having carefully examined the outputs of the consultation process, my Department is now designing the scheme and I intend to bring a proposal to Government setting out that design in the near future.

the local authority has no role in this agreement. The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an\u00a0independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants. HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections available to all private rented tenancies. <\/p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from issuing the formal notification letters, there would always be attempts to contact the tenants by phone and by email to settle accounts and avoid escalation of the debt process. Depending on the particular arrears in question, both the relevant local authority and the landlord are informed when an account has not been cleared and of possible suspension and\/ or cessation of the HAP payment. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To date, the approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. At the end of Q3 2019, the scheme has a 97% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent. Since HAP was rolled out in 2014, HAP support has been ceased for 1,065 tenancies due to tenant differential rent non-payment. This represents less than 2% of all tenancies set up during that period.<\/p>  <p>  Tenancy sustainment is a very important factor in relation to keeping households in their homes. There are a number of avenues for a tenant experiencing financial difficulty including early engagement with the relevant local authority or the Community Welfare Officer. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the assistance available to tenants, there is a fundamental need for a tenant to acknowledge and make the maximum effort to fulfil their personal responsibilities and requirements in relation to contributing to their accommodation costs and to engage early when difficulties arise. The rent contribution that a household is asked to pay is calculated by the\u00a0local authority\u00a0having regard to the financial circumstances of the household and affordability. The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of the contributions from households and exchequer funding, so it is absolutely critical that additional unnecessary burden is not placed on the exchequer to offset non-payment of differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  As the HAP scheme grows, the SSC are continuously working to improve systems and processes, including debt management processes. My Department, with the assistance of stakeholders, including the Housing Agency, HAP Practitioners from local authorities and also the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, will continue to work with the SSC to ensure that the debt management process is reasonable and effective and that the appropriate tenancy sustainment options are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700090#WRKK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Pressure Zones","counter":1959,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700090#WRKK02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1960,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[52753\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700090#WRKK02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if rents on properties within a rent pressure zone can be increased by more than 4% in one year in circumstances in which a new company has taken over a development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1961,"content":"<p>The Planning and Development and Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2016\u00a0introduced the\u00a0 Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising, resulting in great difficulty for households finding affordable accommodation.

It contains conclusions on the state of fire safety in Ireland and\u00a0recommendations for moving forward.<\/p>  <p>  The Task Force report makes a range of recommendations for improvements to fire safety in buildings, and to provision of fire services in Ireland. In response to the recommendations, the NDFEM Board has brought forward a number of initiatives, including proposals for regulatory provisions and guidance for ensuring fire safety in buildings, and for fire services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The proposed legislation will ensure that these changes can be made as expeditiously as possible.

It will help ensure that we can continue to deliver a modernised Fire and Rescue Service responsive to the particular demands of modern society. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the first phase of the Grenfell Tower fire was published on October 30th 2019. My Department has taken the lead in co-ordinating the\u00a0analysis of the Report in an Irish context.

I recently brought a comprehensive report to Government - &ldquo;A Review Report on Severe Weather Events\" - which reported on the response to severe weather events for the period from August 2017 to August 2018, including ex-Hurricane Ophelia (October 2017) and storm Emma (March 2018).<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the Report concluded that the response effort was generally effective in terms of a &ldquo;Whole-of-Government&rdquo; approach involving local and community response, national co-ordination and provision of public information, and was well-received by the public. I am satisfied with the progress already made in implementing those recommendations falling within the remit of my own Department and the proposed legislation will facilitate further work. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to public safety, my Department is in the process of finalising a review of the issue of safety at funfairs. The broad objective of the Review is to assess whether in light of recent events in Ireland and elsewhere, the current safety regime as it applies to funfairs remains fit for purpose. The review which involved significant stakeholder engagement, covers aspects of legislation relating to regulation of fairground equipment and funfairs as currently set down in section 239 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, and includes an examination of international practice in the area of regulating public safety at funfairs and more generally. A key part of the Review will be how learnings from the funfair safety system can be applied in a broader public safety and emergency management context and any associated legislative changes needed to effect this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700090#WRKK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage

to ensure a supply of accommodation to meet different types of social housing need. Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. <\/p><p>Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources. All homes delivered under leasing arrangements are funded under\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), which has an annual budget in 2019 of almost &euro;155million, which covers the ongoing cost of existing contractual arrangements and the cost of\u00a0new leases commenced within the year. <\/p><p>The Enhanced Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives. \u00a0A key aspect of the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme is that the proposer will finance 100% of the cost of delivering the homes and remain responsible for the ongoing management and maintenance of the properties, including all building life-cycle costs. \u00a0<\/p><p>A number of financial and economic studies carried out during the development of the enhanced leasing scheme supported the rationale for the provision of social housing through mechanisms such as the leasing and renting of privately owned accommodation.\u00a0At the time of the Government decision in 2015 to develop a new leasing scheme, consideration of costs and comparative costs was undertaken which informed the Government decision to proceed at that time. \u00a0A further set of costings were undertaken to inform the Government agreement to move forward and launch the enhanced leasing scheme in January 2018. These costings were undertaken using information on average lease costs, at that time, and the expected level of take-up of the scheme, which is targeted at 2,500 units by end 2021.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The costs of the Enhanced Lease are included in the Government's commitment to multi-annual funding to deliver on the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland. The exact and full financial costs per unit will vary across local authority areas and are subject to a range of variables, including the agreed market rents and payable rent, management and maintenance costs, administration costs and differential rent recoupment.<\/p><p>There are a number of factors that ensure that leasing is good value in the long term for the State. The cost of delivering social housing units under the traditional construction and acquisition model is not adequately captured by the up-front capital expenditure, as each unit will carry a stream of ongoing costs over the long-term including management, maintenance and remediation. Furthermore, during the term of an enhanced lease, the responsibility for structural matters and day-to-day property maintenance remains with the property owner and not the local authority.\u00a0 At the end of the lease term &ndash; 25 years is a substantial period - the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading resulting in a significant capital cost, which under leasing is not borne by the Local Authority but by the owner. <\/p><p>Whilst it is clearly beneficial to build on local authority own land, there are instances where such land is not available. Consequently, to purchase the land on the open market would significantly add to the overall development costs. \u00a0In this context, it is important to note that leasing in general is designed to complement local authority own build programmes, not replace it, and to do so in a manner that does not require additional capital expenditure, i.e. it is off-balance sheet. <\/p><p>A spending review and analysis of current expenditure on housing supports was carried out by the Irish Government Economic &amp;amp; Evaluation Service (IGEES) staff within the Department of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in 2017 and 2018. \u00a0Amongst other findings, the report found that while relative cost efficiency is an important consideration in terms of the mix of delivery, it is not the only consideration and leasing must be viewed in the context of policy objectives and wider issues. This is particularly important in the current climate where it is essential to ensure the highest possible supply in the shortest possible time.\u00a0In this context, as well as relative costs, a number of other considerations must be taken into account in terms of the overall mix of delivery including the speed of delivery, the quality and appropriateness of accommodation, sectoral capacity and flexibility. <\/p><p>With respect to the assessment of individual proposals, all submissions are made directly to the Housing Agency and are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the terms and conditions for entry into the scheme and the proposals are assessed in accordance with the criteria set out therein. The terms and conditions for entry are available on the Housing Agency's website at the following link:<\/p><p><i> <\/i><\/p><p>Proposers are required to provide a brief summary of their strategy to source committed funding to meet their development and lease obligations to include, without limitation, delivery of\u00a0homes and delivery of the services under the lease and include all relevant financial information for assessment (including life-cycle costs, maintenance costs etc.). \u00a0The Housing Agency, which\u00a0has responsibility for overseeing and managing the assessment process, assesses this information in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA)\u00a0in order to ensure that the proposer has the capability to deliver both the units themselves and their obligations under the lease. This assessment is carried out in advance of any acceptance into the scheme and the signing of any agreements but, in the first instance, a Local Authority is required to asses a proposal and a) indicate whether the proposal is suitable and appropriate for social housing in the area in which it is situated and, b) whether it agrees with the proposed Open Market rents for the properties.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Government decision, the provider will be paid up to 95% market rate. The market rent must be evidenced by a valuation prepared by a qualified valuer and each valuation must refer to 3 comparable properties in the locality as evidence of the market rent for the property.\u00a0 The local authority will assess the rent against their own rent database and available market information to determine whether it is acceptable or not. \u00a0Where there is a disagreement on the relevant Open Market Rent, an Independent Valuation will be carried out by a suitably qualified practitioner appointed by the Housing Agency. <\/p><p>Local authorities will also determine the overall suitability of the proposed properties, having regard to the standard of the properties, the requirement for social housing in the area and the criteria set out in each authority&rsquo;s Development Plans, including in particular sustainable communities&rsquo; considerations.<\/p><p>When a local authority is considering an Enhanced Leasing proposal, it has regard to its own construction programme, land availability and a range of other factors as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Specifics of the proposal at hand; <\/p><p>- Availability of land in the immediate vicinity; <\/p><p>- Demand for social housing in the area; <\/p><p>- Capacity of the local authority to deliver a capital construction programme; <\/p><p>- Capacity of local authority to maintain the properties; and <\/p><p>- Ability to deliver at speed comparable to what is being proposed.\u00a0<\/p><p>The units secured in the referenced development represent good value for the local authority and will provide immediate, secure, high quality social housing for many households, including many families potentially living in emergency accommodation, in an area of extremely high social housing demand. In broad terms, leasing offers the opportunity to secure high quality long-term social housing in areas or developments that may not otherwise be available for social housing and this proposal is testament to that &ndash; the families living in this accommodation will benefit from its highly accessible location and good quality public transport links. \u00a0The annual rent paid by the local authority for these units is fully in line with the terms of the Enhanced Leasing Scheme, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s decision in 2018, and the proposal was assessed in accordance with same, as with all Enhanced Leasing proposals and includes a deduction for the Part V obligation on the site.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department closely monitors the comparable delivery costs of all enhanced leasing proposals, having regard to the development and all life-cycle risks that are retained by the property owner for the life of the property, the ongoing costs of the lease payments (including any Part V deductions), the ability of the local authority to meet its housing needs through its own build programme and the overall targets clearly set out under Rebuilding Ireland for build, acquisition and leasing programmes.\u00a0 The proposal was assessed in these terms, in addition to the wider policy and delivery objectives, and I am satisfied that process followed was in line with the terms of the Enhanced Leasing Scheme and that the housing needs of these families are best met through this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700090#WRKK05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety Regulations","counter":1990,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700091#WRLL00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1991,"qnumday":753,"qnumall":"[52916\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700091#WRLL00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if an apartment built in 1997, which complied with fire safety regulations at the time, is now obliged to upgrade its fire alarm systems in order to comply with 2013 regulations.","asker":"1367","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1992,"content":"<p>The design and construction of buildings is regulated under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014.
