The aim of the Government&rsquo;s preparations is to make sure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for a no-deal Brexit, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s most recent contingency action plan.  That plan set out in detail our analysis of the risks and impacts of a no-deal outcome across a range of key issues and sectors, and the extensive work ongoing across Government to mitigate these risks.  The plan follows on the enactment of the Brexit omnibus Bill earlier this year and the roll-out of a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement.  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise Brexit disruption to trade to the greatest extent possible.  My Department and its agencies are advancing preparations within the whole-of-government framework overseen by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach.

In the context of the budget, can the Minister confirm that in his no-deal Brexit package, he intends to set out an overall scenario that will go beyond the &euro;2.8 billion package, perhaps well beyond it, but that the additional money will only be called upon in the event of a no-deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600003#A00700","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1569490200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>To work through each of the Deputy's questions, the answer to his final question is \"Yes\".

The consequences of dealing with more people becoming unemployed or of having to support parts of certain sectors will mean reducing a surplus we would otherwise have and moving into what I would aim to be a temporary deficit.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second question regarding when the engagement with the European Commission will come to an end, much of that depends on the engagement that will happen between the EU and the UK in the run-up to the European Council.  I take the Deputy's point.  If we move into October, Irish businesses will need to know what the contingency plans are.  To agree with a point he made earlier, if a no-deal Brexit is averted on 31 October by means of, for example, an extension, that means the risk then shifts fully into the year which this budget oversees.  The risk, therefore, is still there and it is absolutely within the time period in which the House expects budgetary decisions to be made. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600004#B00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","time":1569490500,"counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600004#B00350"},{"type":"question","time":1569490500,"counter":17,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[39204\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600004#B00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to implement further reforms in view of the increasing costs of insurance for many sectors and the escalating crisis in the market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","time":1569490500,"counter":18,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[39207\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600004#B00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps being taken to protect businesses and voluntary organisations from increasing insurance costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1569490500,"counter":19,"content":"<p>There is a full-blown insurance crisis in every part of the State.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits rules that require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided either to consumers or businesses.  A further constraint is the fact that, for constitutional reasons, Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  In summary, therefore, there is unfortunately no quick-fix solution to this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to re-emphasise, however, that this issue remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group, established three years ago, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of both of its reports.  Its most recent progress update was published in July and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by quarter 2 of 2019 have been completed.<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, some further measures will be carried out by Government over the next few months.  These include the following the commencement of the remaining parts of the Judicial Council Act 2019, which provides for the establishment of a personal injuries guidelines committee.  It is now a matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the personal injuries guidelines committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the book of quantum.  This is an essential step if award levels are to be reduced.  We will have the completion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s feasibility study into adding employer and public liability insurance to the national claims information database, which is due by the end of the year.  We will have the completion of the CSO's feasibility study into tracking the cost of business insurance, as it does with other forms of insurance, including motor.  The CSO is due to report back to my Department by the end of the year.  There is also the Law Reform Commission's work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries.  It is expected that there will be a public consultation on this by the end of the year.  We will also see the furtherance of measures necessary to implement pre-action protocols for personal injury cases, beginning with medical negligence cases.<\/p>  <p>  I have been engaging with insurers to seek a commitment that they will reduce premiums and widen their risk appetite should there be a recalibration of award levels downwards once the new personal injury guidelines are introduced.  In this regard, I am encouraged by the comments made by a number of insurers at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in July that they would be prepared to pass on such savings in such circumstances.  The Deputy should also note that a number of UK insurers that have recently exited the Irish market have also expressed a willingness to re-enter it in the event of a recalibration of awards downwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600004#B00700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1569490500,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I hear what the Minister of State is saying on the issue of the Judicial Council Act and its execution.  Implementation is crucial and we need to make sure that next step is taken.  However, I fail to believe he fully grasps the magnitude of what is happening.  Every week companies are closing.  This summer, community festivals that had been running for decades did not run because of insurance premiums.  Leisure centres, play centres and swimming pools have closed, and that is just over the summer months, and we only hear of the ones that make the headlines in the national media.  A public participation network has conducted a survey showing 83% of its sector faced higher premiums over the past three years, a significant number had seen their premiums double, and more than 30% are paying on average &euro;1,500 annually for insurance cover.  This is damaging communities, jobs and the local economy.

They are going to be out of business.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to the issue of awards.

Deputy Pearse Doherty has heard my time schedule, which I have said I would like to see achieved by the Judiciary.

Will he restate the timeline he envisages as to when the new award levels will be confirmed and take effect?

This does not affect only the leisure sector but, taking that as an example, as the renewals come on stream and people cannot get insurance, what if we see almost an entire sector not even unable to afford insurance but simply unable to access it?  Those operating in the sector will have to shut their doors.  This is spreading to other sectors as well, such as hospitality.  This is a crisis.

We know that the insurance industry has reported only 50 suspected fraudulent cases out of the tens of thousands it was suggesting are out there.  The reality - facts speak loud - is that awards are dropping.  In the High Court they went down from &euro;85 million to &euro;57 million last year; in the Circuit Court, where they went up slightly, by 2.3%, the total amount of awards was &euro;23 million.  The full quantum of awards paid out through the Courts Service dropped dramatically last year, yet the Minister of State tells us the solution to this is simply awards.  It is not.  A multi-agency approach and multiple solutions to this are needed and the Minister of State needs to stand up to the industry.<\/p>  <p>  I therefore question him on this, as I have questioned the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach.  Have they sat down with Insurance Ireland?  Have they told them we have a complete market failure here?

When the underwriter that used to underwrite these businesses moved its headquarters from London to Dublin, two Government Ministers issued press releases welcoming AXA XL.  Have they lifted the phone to AXA XL and said, \"Thank you for coming to Dublin as a result of Brexit, but why are you screwing over our indigenous business and withdrawing from the market?\"  They cannot have it both ways.  The Minister of State needs to stand up to these companies.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, does the Minister of State have anything to say about the fact that the State pockets &euro;230 million in taxes and levies as a result of the premiums that are skyrocketing and putting businesses out of business and workers out of jobs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600005#C00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1569491100,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to bring this down to brass tacks.

To qualify for the scheme an applicant must be in possession of a primary medical certificate.  To qualify for a primary medical certificate, an applicant must satisfy one of the following conditions: be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme represents a significant tax expenditure, which is justified in terms of responding to the needs of applicants with this level of challenge in their daily lives.

The air ambulance service, currently based in Athlone, provides immediate access for people who become suddenly or acutely ill to a central hospital and life-saving treatment.  It was introduced to supplement the traditional road-based ambulance service and allows people who live in remote areas, who have been involved in a road traffic accidents in urban areas or who suffer from heart, brain or other acute illnesses rapid access to a major hospital.<\/p><p>In 2018, the service dealt with 159 road traffic accidents and 146 medical emergencies.  That gives a sense of the difference made by the service to lives, families and communities across the country on a daily basis.  Every Deputy in the House knows that the ambulance service is under inordinate pressure and ambulance response times are far longer than they should be.  The latest figures provided in response to parliamentary questions for the north west, west, midlands, south east and south west show that, on average, only half of the calls reached a patient in less than the recommended time of 19 minutes and many calls are in excess of the hour necessary.  The air ambulance service is important and has worked and provided certainty for medical professionals, families and those involved in acute situations.<\/p><p>At the RACO conference yesterday, it was revealed that the Defence Forces are no longer in a position to staff the service comprehensively as it currently exists.  Lieutenant colonels and senior management are being forced to fly the service because those who have traditionally flown have left the Defence Forces.  It is another sign of the flight from our Defence Forces, a flight which has occurred despite an underspend on salaries within the Defence Forces.  Deputies Chambers and O'Loughlin and many others have consistently brought this to the attention of the Government, but it has ignored the issue.  As a consequence of that, the air ambulance service is now under threat.  People in communities around the country have read the report and are worried.<\/p><p>Can the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, accept that there are problems in the air ambulance service and give a guarantee on behalf of the Government that it will continue to provide the current level of service and response times?  When will the Government finally cop on and wake up to what it is doing to our Defence Forces?  It is standing by while people are leaving the Defence Forces in droves and services such as this are being affected.

This is squeezing incomes and leading to the closure of businesses throughout the State.  The scale of the insurance industry rip-off is paralleled only by the scale of the Government's inaction in failing to tackle the escalating costs and the malpractice within the industry, of which there is probably no better example than the practice of price discrimination that punishes loyal customers when they renew their premiums.<\/p>  <p>  My insurance company, Liberty Insurance, recently quoted me a price of &euro;856 to renew my policy.  I did what we all should do and shopped around.  I phoned the company and asked whether that was the best price it could offer.  I was told that it could reduce the price slightly and that its best price was &euro;814.  However, when I entered the same details into the company's website, I was quoted &euro;571, a reduction of &euro;280 or 33% on the offers I received over the phone or in my renewal quotation.<\/p>  <p>  This practice, known as dual pricing, is about punishing loyal customers when they renew their policy.  It is a widespread scam in the industry and is costing consumers hundreds of euros each year without them even knowing it is happening.  These companies exploit customers who do not know about dual pricing.  They rely on the loyalty of customers and use behavioural data and dual pricing algorithms in their systems to charge extortionate prices and push up their profit margins.  Everyone with an insurance policy will have to renew it in the next 12 months and I encourage them to shop around and check online.  Price discrimination is widespread in the insurance market.  It is systemic, completely unjustifiable and flies in the face of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  It harms the interests and welfare of consumers.  It is carried out without transparency, penalises loyalty and disproportionately hits vulnerable and low-income customers.  It is a rip-off on a vast scale, but nothing is being done here to stop it.<\/p>  <p>  In spite of all the dysfunction across the water in Britain, the Financial Conduct Authority there has launched a major investigation into the practice of dual pricing in the insurance industry after it found that customers renewing their policies were charged as much as 70% more than first-time customers.  That is the loyalty premium the industry levies on customers here.  In contrast, however, the Government has done nothing to end this practice, penalise the industry or give workers and families a break.  Yesterday, I wrote to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Governor of the Central Bank to ask that they carry out an immediate investigation into the practice of price discrimination by the insurance industry.  Will the Ministers for Finance and Business, Enterprise and Innovation support my call for an immediate investigation into the scam of dual pricing?

It is undoubtedly the case that the Government has been particularly active in this area.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has implemented a wide range of measures to seek to control this issue.  Most recently, the Government brought in the Judicial Council Act which will lead to greater consistency in awards.  We reformed the legislation governing the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to make it easier to settle without expensive legal procedures.  There is a greater focus by the courts and the Garda on fraud in the area.  We passed legislation to improve data collection by the Central Bank.  This week, the Central Bank took steps against brokers in respect of some of the ways in which they behave in the market.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to inform the Deputy that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has asked the CCPC to study activities in the insurance industry, including those of brokers.  There is no doubt that some practices in the industry are not satisfactory.  Improvement will be brought about through the greater transparency, which is being demanded, the higher level of scrutiny of industry practices, which the commission will undertake, increased data collection and more oversight by Oireachtas Members of what is happening within the sector.

As discussed at a recent Cabinet committee meeting, a review is being carried out to see whether we could introduce further measures to play our role more effectively.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that insurance costs are a significant challenge.

I am not the only person who has experienced this practice.  A 21-year-old constituent of mine got a quote from Liberty Insurance of &euro;5,160, which is an extortionate and rip-off price.

When I entered her details into Liberty Insurance computer system, it returned a quote of &euro;3,857.  That is &euro;1,300 less than the cheapest price the company told her it could offer.

Some 760,000 people, one in six people and one in four children in the State, are living below the official poverty line.  The poverty line is an income 60% below the median &euro;27,000 a year, therefore, an income of &euro;13,000 or less puts one below the poverty line.  Some 110,000 people living below the poverty are in work.  Just under a half of one-parent families suffer deprivation.  One in 11 working lone parents were living below the poverty line in 2012 and, in 2017, it was one in five.  Some 25% of those living below the poverty line do not have a medical card.  Some 10,305 people are homeless, including 3,821 children, but everyone knows the figure is much higher.  Just under 72,000 households are on the list for public housing but such housing does not exist.  The figure would be much higher if account was taken of those people who transferred to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and were put on transfer lists: those people were taken off the official housing waiting list.  One in five renters spend 40% of their income on rent.  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, cited figures this morning indicating it costs &euro;1,200 per month, nationally, to rent, which is 20% higher than it has ever been.  In Dublin, the cost is up at &euro;1,700, which is 32% higher than it has ever been.  I could go on.  Some 194,000 additional people are on outpatient appointment waiting lists compared to 2015, which is an increase of more 50%, in a health service that does not work.  The numbers waiting more than 18 months for treatment has risen by 715%.  These are record levels.  The Irish Patients Association's spokesperson stated this Government should look on this as a crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Is this not a shocking and shameful situation in a wealthy country with a growing economy?  Even leaving aside leprechaun GDP, we are in the top ten OECD countries.  What I have given the Minister are statistics but behind each of those is a person, a child, a family and communities in deprived areas.  On top of that, community groups are fearing a freeze on their funding in the forthcoming budget, having faced a cut of 40% during the past number of years and a loss of staff of 31%.  They are seriously concerned about their ability to continue delivering services.  I put it to the Minister that we have a poverty crisis to go along with our housing crisis and health crisis but there is no discussion about them or sense of urgency to address them.  The Minister's party, Fine Gael, has been in a leading role in government for eight years and it seems it is prepared to accept this poverty, low wages, a housing shortage, rack-renting and a shambles of a health service as some sort of new norm for Irish society.  Is the Minister and the Government not ashamed?  Will they address these serious issues, particularly with a potential recession coming around the corner with, or without, a Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600014#M00600","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1569496500,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I am glad the Deputy raised these issues as it gives me an opportunity to set out the Government's commitment in this area.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, as the Deputy will know, has set reducing child poverty as her top issue within her Department.  The evidence is there that very significant progress is being made.  In 2013, the number of children living in consistent poverty was 12.7% and two years ago, in 2017, that percentage had fallen to 8.8%.  There has been a reduction, even in those years, of 105,000 children living in consistent poverty.  I have no doubt that since 2017, with improving investments in the economy, improving employment opportunities and the policy measures the Government has put in place, those figures will improve.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth recalling some of those measures that are targeting people living in poverty.  We have had significant improvement in the qualified child payments in our social welfare code which go to people on the lowest level of income.  We have had increased provision for school meals and for school clothing and footwear allowances, again targeting children in greatest need.  We have extended GP access and improved the family income supplement now known as the working family payment.  Right across the area, particularly in education, of which I am aware, we have put big investments into childcare, under both the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the Minister, Deputy McHugh.  We have strengthened the early childhood provisions, particularly targeting disadvantaged areas and improved support particularly for children with special educational needs who unfortunately are found in greater frequency in many of those disadvantaged areas.  We have seen very substantial expansion of both special needs assistants and resource teachers to target those children.  There is no doubt that early intervention is really important in continuing the battle against child poverty.  I am confident the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will continue to target this as a top priority for Government.  We need to look at innovative policies.  I was very pleased to see, among the policy approaches we are taking, clusters of schools in disadvantaged areas come together, for example, with the ARC project.  Often children transferring from preschool to primary school can fall through the crevices.  A very interesting initiative has been introduced in the constituency of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who is seated next to Deputy Joan Collins, to make sure children do not fall through the crevice in that transfer.  A lot of good work is going on in this area and I can assure the Deputy we will continue to be committed to delivering more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600014#M00700","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1569496500,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The figures I read out are from Society of St. Vincent De Paul, representatives of which appeared before the Joint Committee on Employment and Social Protection this morning for a prebudget meeting.  Those figures are stark.  The Minister mentioned a few projects and initiatives that have been introduced but they are not enough.  What we need over the next one, two and three budgets is to take people out of poverty.  That is crucial.  We will face a recession in this country without or without a Brexit.  Either way we need to invest and put a buffer around people who are the ones who suffered more under the austerity policies of Fianna F&aacute;il from 2008 and under Fine Gael up to 2013 or so.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat that the number of one-parent working families living in poverty has doubled since 2012 and 110,000 workers are living in poverty.  The concept is that if one gets a job it will take one out of poverty, but unless one has decent wages and decent, unionised conditions, that situation will not change.

Irish soldiers have given their lives in the service of peace around the world, protecting some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens.  Thousands of their families at home have endured the absence of a father or a mother during the long period of overseas service.  Our Air Corps fly air ambulances and save hundreds of lives annually.  The Naval Service patrols the equivalent of 220 million acres of sea, over 12 times the landmass of Ireland and 15% of total European fisheries.  The navy has intercepted some of the largest drugs shipments in EU waters and is a vital component in Ireland&rsquo;s war on organised crime and drug gangs.<\/p>  <p>  Our Defence Forces, however, are in deep crisis.  In particular, there is a recruitment and retention crisis.  This week the Chief of Staff, not known for his outspokenness, sent a coded message to the Government when he said, &ldquo;Some great people are making the choice to leave the organisation and the level and trend in the churn is a matter of concern for me&rdquo;.  The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, president made the point more clearly when he said ships are unable to go sea, aircraft are not flying and units are operating below strength across the board.<\/p>  <p>  The designated strength of the Defence Forces is 9,500 personnel.  Its current strength is below that number by as much as 1,000.  Already this year, there have been 558 discharges.  The turnover rate referred to by the Chief of Staff is at 10.3%, which is devastating for our Defence Forces.  That rate of turnover means that the Defence Forces will never return to full strength and will fall to 7,500 by 2030.  The situation is so bad that even recruits in training are paying to get out of the services.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is presiding over a situation where our Defence Forces personnel are the lowest-paid workers in the public service with some earning less than the minimum wage and up to 85% earning less than the average industrial wage.  In view of the understrength numbers, the significant turnover rate, the large number of personnel, including new recruits, leaving the service, and the number of naval protection vessels out of commission due to the lack of personnel and the underspend in the Department of Defence, will the Government improve the pay conditions and allowances of the Defence Forces, including the immediate and full restoration of all cuts in pay allowances and services?  Will the Government increase immediately the basic minimum hourly rate of pay to at least the living wage?  Will the Government withdraw the tender for the &euro;200 million multi-role warship to use that money to improve the pay, conditions and allowances of our personnel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600015#N00300","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1569497100,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I join with Deputy Healy in recognising the debt that we owe to all those who work in the Defence Forces.  Their work, particularly abroad, has made us all proud and contributed to Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation.  This must be acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has recognised that there are particular problems in the Defence Forces.  This is why there was a comprehensive examination undertaken by the Public Service Pay Commission of the pay conditions in the Defence Forces.  That work has been done.  The commission&rsquo;s report has been accepted by the Government and by RACO.  That provides for a whole series of improvements in pay conditions in the Defence Forces.  It has been accompanied by a detailed implementation plan, setting out how that will be done.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of some of the changes such as the 10% increase in the military service allowance, immediate restoration of allowances to the pre-Haddington Road agreement level, the reinstatement of several allowances specific to the Defence Forces such as the security duty allowance, the patrol duty allowance, the Army Ranger Wing allowance, as well as payments to bomb disposal teams.  There has also been a return to premium rates for weekend duties and the re-establishment of the service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots.  Another significant development that recognises the important role of the Defence Forces is the recognition that they need to be brought within the wider industrial relations framework.  The Government welcomes the decision by the executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to accept in principle the application by the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, for associate membership.  That is an important recognition of the role of the Defence Forces and will provide an outlet to ensure the concerns raised are adequately responded to.  The Minister of State is working to facilitate that.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of particular moneys allocated for ships or underspend being allocated to pay.  Unfortunately, that is not possible.  We have a unified public pay policy that is negotiated and settled.  It is not at the discretion of an individual Minister to take moneys which have been voted for one purpose and then to allocate them to pay increases.  There is good reason for that.  There must be a consistent public pay policy.  At the same time, it must be able to deal with particular challenges.

Every day, we have 7,000 people in our hospitals to have procedures completed who then leave the hospital.  Every day, 4,500 turn up at our emergency departments and are treated.  There is no doubt there is pressure on the system and there is growing demand from an ageing population on existing capacity.  We have to invest not just in additional staff but in expanding capacity.  That is why a significant capital budget has been put in place for the health service so we can build capacity.  People are working to the very best of their ability within the health service to provide and deliver a high-quality service but there is pressure.

It was originally founded on the basis of delivering lifelong services of various kinds to people with intellectual disabilities.  In recent years, because of the lack of funding and the fact that it is not being paid for the services delivered, the range of services it has and its capacity to deal with different clients who come forward are now under threat.  It is unable to provide that lifelong service to its clients.  SOS is an extremely good service that works efficiently and well.  The manager there, Mr. Francis Coughlan, has done everything in his power to ensure that the money he gets is spread evenly and deals with the issues.  At present, he has 50 cases.  They are called business cases but they are really cases requesting funding from the Department to satisfy the need of an intellectually-challenged individual.  There is no decision from the Department on these cases.  In fact, to bring its services to where they were previously and keep them at a standstill would require &euro;1 million.  SOS would have to have those 50 cases dealt with immediately, with full funding being granted.  These is no respite care for those who use the service and SOS has urgently asked that the Minister would consider providing the funding to have two respite beds available when they are needed for those who are attending that service.<\/p>  <p>  To give the Minister an example I raised with the Taoiseach, a client of that service for 30 years has been in St. Luke's General Hospital since last November.  He is medically discharged but there is no place for him within SOS because it cannot provide the funding.  The infrastructure and the building are there.  It requires immediate funding of &euro;600,000 for that project.  The hospital setting is costing nearly &euro;2,000 per day and is inappropriate for the man's needs.  He is not getting the services that he requires.  His parents are deeply concerned that this is an emerging trend within that organisation that is so well-respected and supportive of the parents and the clients.  They were deeply concerned and expressed their worry, as the parents or the guardians of the children in care, about who would look after the children when their lives were over.  This is a question that has to be answered.  Francis Coughlan and SOS deserve a direct reply and response.<\/p>  <p>  The management of the services by the HSE is appalling.  It is willing to stand to one side and allow these services to deteriorate and to allow people to be left in inappropriate settings in hospitals.<\/p><p>There is literally no response.  When I asked the Taoiseach that morning I was taken aback by the cold way in which he answered the question.  I followed him out of the Chamber and gave him a written note about the difficulties facing that individual but I am now talking about the overall plan to provide the life care services required by the clients by SOS.  I ask the Minister of State to address the issue comprehensively and to deal with the fact that this man has been in hospital since last November.  That is a separate issue but he is a client of SOS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600022#Y00200","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569501300,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to the provision of respite services to clients of SOS in Kilkenny.<\/p>  <p>  This Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities, which will empower them to live independent lives.  Respite services are an important part of the range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families.  Short breaks can also provide an opportunity for individuals to meet new people, widen their social circles, and gain new experiences.  Respite care is crucial in helping to reduce family stress, preserve family units, and provide stability.<\/p>  <p>  The need for increased respite services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with all service providers to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.  As part of its ongoing service provision, the HSE will provide more than 182,500 respite nights and 32,662 day respite sessions this year to families in need right across the country.  In 2018, there was a significant improvement in respite.  An additional &euro;10 million was provided to fund 12 new respite homes.  This comprises one in each HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, area and an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite in this region.  These 12 additional houses are providing additional respite for families that need it.<\/p>  <p>  This year the HSE will also fund a number of alternative respite services.  These are practical and important solutions, such as summer camps and evening and Saturday clubs, which benefit hundreds of adults and children.  The number of adult service users continually increases as service users transfer from child to adult services.  This impacts on the level of respite existing service users receive.<\/p>  <p>  The budget allocation for SOS in 2019 is approximately &euro;10.7 million, which represents an increase of 4.5% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;10.2 million.  This allocation provides for the maintenance of the 2018 level of approved services in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  South East Community Healthcare is proactively working with the SOS CEO and team to develop a plan that will contribute to resolving the organisation's financial position in a structured way over a time-defined period.  In addition, the respite house in Tullow, County Carlow is expected to open in due course.  To ensure the continued provision of respite services across the south east, a task force group has been established to review respite services and ensure delivery in a fair and equitable way that meets the needs of the service users.  SOS Kilkenny is a member of this task force group.<\/p>  <p>  If Deputy McGuinness would like to forward me some information regarding the person about whom he spoke, I will bring it to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harris, straight away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600023#Z00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1569501300,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response, but she is being misled by the HSE.  I ask that she rings Dr. Cathal Morgan, Ms Janette Dwyer, and Ms Kate Killeen White, all of whom work for the HSE.  Each of those three are involved in managing services in the area in which SOS Kilkenny is located.  The Minister of State should ask them why that man is in hospital and why services in SOS are being continually run down.  She should ask them why the 50 business cases are not being approved and why there is no direct engagement with SOS to assist Francis Coughlan in delivering the services committed to.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State says that the budget is there and that approved services will be maintained at their 2018 levels.  The 2018 levels do not reflect the amount of activity that should be taking place in the service.  It represents a reduction on the services provided in 2017, which was itself a reduction on 2016.  The Minister of State's comment was not inaccurate, but it is very misleading to say that services are at their 2018 levels.  We do not want them at those levels.  We want to fulfil the commitment given by those who started the service, which was to deliver a lifelong service to those who need it.  That is not being done.  It is not being achieved.  People and their families are appalled that the HSE has not responded.  It is showing no humanity and no compassion whatsoever.  It is hard to stand by and listen to that type of answer from the HSE or the Department of Health when they know full well that the services are pushed to the pin of their collar and are unable to deliver what is demanded of them, let alone what they wish to deliver, because clients requiring services are turning up in great numbers.  The HSE is turning a blind eye.<\/p>  <p>  I revert to the issue of management.  Those in management must explain why this is happening.  They must be made accountable and must be transparent.  I again encourage the Minister of State to make those three phone calls and to seek some form of humanity, compassion or relief in respect of what SOS is trying to achieve in Kilkenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600023#Z00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1569501300,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I reiterate that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is very aware of the importance of access to planned respite and that he assures the Deputy that everything possible will be done to help those who need respite, particularly families with an ongoing need for respite for their child and adult members in order to have a break.  I have taken down the names of HSE staff the Deputy mentioned.  Will he repeat the last person?  I got the first two.

I will provide two examples.  I know of one person who applied last December.  He was advised that he had a knee problem and would have to get an operation.  He got a scan done here in the South of Ireland.  When he went up to the North he was told that it did not look like a knee operation was necessary.  A full body scan was carried out and it was found that three vertebrae had fused; it was not his knee but his back.  He had to apply for a change of code because different procedures are paid under different codes.  It took from 23 July until 9 September for that application for a change of code to go through.  It finally went through just before the consultant emailed him for his pre-operation consultation.  The operation was carried out only last week.  He has been waiting for reimbursement since June, when he was in hospital in the North.  He rang up and was told that he could not be given a date for reimbursement.  This scheme was brought in on the basis that people would be reimbursed within 30 days.  People are getting credit union loans.  This particular gentleman has been out of work for so long while waiting for his operation that he is on the pension rate of pay.  He could not afford to pay the &euro;15,000.  His brother took out a loan of &euro;15,000 from the credit union to pay it.<\/p><p>He is paying back &euro;150 per week and still awaiting reimbursement.  In another case of mine a young man who had an operation in March is still waiting to be reimbursed.<\/p> <p> There is no point in setting up a scheme if it cannot be relied on.  If a patient is told that he or she will be reimbursed within 30 days but must wait for 90 or 100, it causes major financial problems.  The HSE will have to get its act together.  I acknowledge there are problems, including staffing problems.  If there are no staff, they should be put in place.  There is definitely something perverse about the public health service being run down, with 194,000 additional outpatients since 2015, representing an increase of 50%.  The report on this issue came out last week.  There are 18-month waiting periods for operations.  Patients are being forced into this.  Taxpayers' money is being pumped into private hospitals in France, Germany, Spain, Britain, the North and here.  There are Spanish public patients transferred to Ireland to private hospitals under the cross-border directive.  I read an article that stated &euro;2.5 million was paid in 2016 to private hospitals and &euro;12.3 million last year.  In the meantime, we are not even filling vacancies.  Consultants have gone through the interview process.  The figure for Galway is 11 and for Donegal, 100.  There is a deliberate EU policy of running down public services and forcing taxpayers to line the pockets of private hospitals.  <\/p> <p> I would like the Minister of State to outline that there is something happening, that the extra staff are being put in place and that the Government is committed to reimbursement within 30 days in order that when patients obtain loans, they can make a commitment to pay them back in that timeframe and not be left high and dry, as is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600023#Z00600","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569501900,"counter":288,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The directive on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare, commonly called the cross-border directive, provides rules for the reimbursement to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in his or her home member state.  The directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the European Union, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another member state, rather than in their home country.  The HSE is responsible for the operation of the cross-border directive and has a dedicated office resourced for this purpose.  The office acts as the national contact point, as set out in governing European legislation, and processes applications for treatment received for the purposes of the operation of the directive.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its functions as the national contact point, the cross-border directive office gives prior authorisation to patients availing of the directive where their treatment involves an overnight stay.  I am informed by the HSE that applications for prior authorisation are generally processed within 15 to 20 working days.  The vast majority of applications for prior authorisation currently in hand will be processed within that timeframe, with the remainder likely to be processed within 25 working days.<\/p>  <p>  The cross-border directive was transposed into Irish legislation in June 2014.  Since its transposition, awareness of the provisions of the directive has grown steadily.  The number of claims for reimbursement being processed by the cross-border directive office has grown from 150 in the first full year, 2015, to 3,886 at the end of 2018.  A total of 3,041 claims for reimbursement were received this year up until the end of August.  The significant growth in use of the scheme and the associated increase in the number of applications being submitted have given rise to an increasing workload and a build-up of applications.  The HSE has advised that the cross-border directive office is operating with a three-month backlog in the processing of claims.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this issue, officials from the Department met representatives of the HSE in July to discuss the issue of reimbursement delays affecting patients who had availed of treatment under the directive.  The HSE has subsequently been requested to examine the current resourcing of the cross-border directive office and identify any necessary action needed to mitigate waiting times arising from current demand under the scheme.  The Minister is aware that some measures have been put in place in the short term, for example, overtime and the deployment of trained staff to address the significant backlog in processing applications.  Officials from the Department will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure appropriate action is taken to provide longer term solutions.  <\/p>  <p>  This matter was raised this morning during Leaders' Questions.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, made a commitment to the Deputy who raised it to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health.  I will do so also.  If Deputy Joan Collins furnishes me with the email pertaining to the individuals in question, we might be able to process it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600024#AA00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1569501900,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I do not know how to respond.  The Minister of State's reply indicates that the Minister has known about this issue since July, yet, at the end of September and heading into October, patients are still waiting for over 90 days to be reimbursed money they borrowed.  They do not have the money to pay &euro;15,000 for a back operation.  That is the cost in the hospital in the North.  The individual in question is on a pension rate of pay and his family are supporting him by paying back the credit union loan.  Reimbursement was expected within 30 days, but it could now be Christmas before that occurs.  The individual is still waiting to be reimbursed for expenditure incurred in June when he had a consultation with the consultant.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 3,886 people are being forced to use the cross-border directive because they cannot have an operation in the South.  They may be waiting for over 18 months, two years or two and a half years.  It is perverse.  The European Union set up the cross-border directive to try to bring people abroad for treatment, involving a stay of one night or more, for which we pay as taxpayers.  Spanish taxpayers are paying for public patients receiving private care in England.  This issue has to be dealt with immediately.  It has been known about since July.  Overtime has been provided.  The Government has to commit to reimbursement within 30 days for those who borrowed money.  That is a very basic point.  Extra staff can be brought in quickly and should have been by now.  I cannot understand how it has not happened, given that the Department has known about this issue since July and spoken to the section concerned.  I would like to see a commitment from the Minister in that regard.

Unfortunately, this successful and much-loved school in Dublin West, which was built at the height of the Celtic tiger era and has 808 pupils in 28 classes, is riddled in construction terms with pyrite.  As a consequence, the children, staff and parents have to endure a building that is no longer fit for purpose.  The school community, including the staff and the parents, has suffered enough.  It has waited patiently for the Department of Education and Skills to address the problems which are causing the floors to buckle, the doors to go out of kilter and the roof to have multiple problems.  I could go on and on.  The Minister probably needs to visit the school.  If he does, he will be shocked to see the condition it is in.  The Department needs to have an immediate plan to provide for temporary replacement accommodation on the grounds of the school while a complete refit is attended to.  Rather than merely monitoring the position, as the Department is doing at present, it needs to ensure all of the pyrite is removed from the buildings and grounds.<\/p>  <p>  I have known St. Patrick's national school well from the day it opened.  When parents and staff brought me around the school the other evening, I was shocked and appalled to see that the situation has become dramatically worse.  Unfortunately, several schools in Dublin 15 have encountered problems of this nature in the last year.  The Department has taken action at two schools, namely, St. Luke's and Tyrrelstown.  St. Luke's has been completely restored and Tyrrelstown is pretty much restored as well.  In the meantime, the people of Diswellstown are looking on as their school deteriorates and buckles before their eyes.  Some of the newer houses that are being built in this area are straight across from the school.  Builders are telling the families that are buying these family homes that this school will be their children's school.  I have been told by the principal that this summer, applications for enrolment in respect of 20 children who are living in the area - their families have come into the area - had to be turned down.<\/p>  <p>  St. Patrick's national school hosts 25 pupils with complex needs, including 14 pupils who are affected by ASD.  The school has no sensory room.  At the moment, it is using all the rooms it can use to accommodate the existing 808 pupils.  The school was recently asked by the Minister to provide an additional ASD-specific room.  There is absolutely no difficulty with that.  This school, like all the schools in Dublin 15, has always catered for a wide variety of children, including children with complex needs.  Where are those children supposed to go?  The special resource room is up in a kind of attic room, with one little window at the bottom.  It is over the school hall, which is shared with Fingal County Council.  The school hall's beautiful sprung beech floor is buckling as well.  I am not a builder, but it is clear to my untrained eye that the whole building is in an absolute state.  I ask the Minister to prioritise the school in the interests of the children, the parents and the staff and to address these issues.  I think he needs to make provision for a temporary building on the grounds of the school while the existing building is completely redone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600025#BB00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1569502500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to update the House on the position with respect to St. Patrick's national school, Diswellstown.  I am aware of the pyrite issue in this school and the health and safety issues to which it gives rise.  I fully understand and appreciate the concerns of the entire school community and the need to address them as quickly and effectively as possible.  The school was constructed by ABM under a design and build contract, under seal, with the Department of Education and Skills as the direct employer.  The school was completed in 2006.  In July 2007, Fingal County Council became aware that the presence of pyrite had been identified as the source of problems in certain residential dwellings.  The then Department of Education and Science, as the owner of the site and building at St. Patrick's national school, Diswellstown Road, Carpenterstown, Dublin 15, had reason to suspect possible ground heave by active pyrites at the school.  This was drawn to our attention as a result of emergency remedial works required to free fire doors and address the toppling of fitted furniture, etc.  These works were undertaken by the original contractor.  In March 2010, the Department engaged a firm of structural engineers, DBFL, which confirmed the presence of pyrites in the building.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has sought legal advice from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in respect of addressing these issues.  Initial plans to remediate in 2014 were suspended on foot of legal advice.  As this matter continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, I am not in a position to comment further on the progression of the remediation programme.  However, I can say that immediate areas of concern are being remediated on an ongoing basis under the Department's emergency works scheme.  The purpose of the emergency works scheme is to address unforeseen emergencies or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils.  In that context, the Department has approved emergency funding to address issues caused by the pyrite since 2016.  At the same time, the school is making progress with a project under the additional accommodation scheme that involves the construction of two mainstream classrooms.  Following a submission from the school indicating the presence of pyrite in the car park, the school authority was given permission to proceed to planning stage to include a car park extension.  The school authority was requested to submit further detailed reports from its consultants in respect of the pyrite issues in the car park.  The Department has sought clarification on some of the details in these reports.  When this information is received, it will be reviewed and officials from the Department will be in contact with the school to make progress with the project.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has also asked about the expanding desire for school places in the area.  If demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision depends on the particular circumstances of each case.  Depending on the circumstances, it may be provided by using existing unused capacity within a school or schools, by extending the capacity of a school or schools, by providing a new school or schools or by a combination of these approaches.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review.  It will have particular regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  The Department will continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded to meet the needs of the local population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600025#BB00700","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1569502500,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for such a frank and honest reply.

It is to be hoped he will ensure they are implemented.<\/p><p>The committee included in its 2018 work programme to undertake a review of the relationship and sexual education, RSE, curriculum, including matters relating to contraception and consent.  The committee carried out an in-depth review of how this is delivered in primary and post-primary schools, colleges, youth clubs and other organisations which play an important role through their interactions with young people.<\/p><p>We sought submissions from a vast number of organisations and received 54 in total.  We then had oral engagement with 26 different organisations and groups.  On behalf of the members of the committee, I want to acknowledge the dedication and hard work of teachers in schools across the State in the delivery of the RSE programme to students.  However, while the current curriculum was viewed as progressive when it was introduced in 1999, the committee feels that 20 years later it needs to be updated in order to take account of the significant societal changes which have taken place.  It is very obvious that, due to these significant changes, it is essential that any RSE curriculum taught in schools equips our children and young people with the tools to navigate successfully and safely our modern world and the challenges they face.<\/p><p>Human relationships are complex and many young people are bombarded with information, particularly by having access to the Internet through smart phones etc.  These online and mostly unregulated sources may not provide them with the most accurate or appropriate information.  Some information accessed by young people is false and can be very damaging.  As a society, we have an obligation to ensure that all such information is challenged and the correct information is delivered in an appropriate and a consistent way.  Legislators have a duty in that regard.<\/p><p>An effective and modern curriculum will teach young people about sex, relationships and respect, but needs to be presented in an appropriate manner, taking account of the age and understanding of the child or individual.  The committee was told that many adults have received little or no relationship or sexuality education due to the inconsistent way in which RSE was taught in the past.  That undoubtedly has a knock-on effect should these people become parents, as it is unlikely that they will have the skills to educate their children in the most effective way possible.  This was of particular concern with respect to people with intellectual disabilities.  One witness suggested that this is possibly due to the perception that people with intellectual disabilities were eternal children.  This is a very dehumanising perspective and one which has to be addressed.<\/p><p>The curriculum must also deal with LGBTQI matters and equip students and young people with the ability to interact with one another in a way which promotes well-being, respects the uniqueness of everyone's identity and helps to reinforce positive sexual behaviours.<\/p><p>The committee believes that delivering the curriculum from an earlier age naturally and in an age and developmentally appropriate manner will remove embarrassment from our children's social development and remove outdated stigmas associated with sex and relationships.  However, it is not enough to produce a curriculum containing information relevant to today's society.  It is also essential that it be delivered in an open, factual and consistent way across primary and post-primary schools, colleges, youth clubs and other organisations that interact with young people.  That said, I acknowledge the dedication and hard work of teachers to the work being carried out.  I thank all who took part in the review of this important topic, which very informative and useful for the committee in the production of the report.<br\/><br\/>It was important that the committee took a modular approach in respect of the organisations and individuals it met.  As I mentioned, 26 groups appeared before it.  The first module investigated the effectiveness of current sexual health and relationship education models.  The committee heard evidence from users, policymakers, parents, teacher and student representative bodies, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the Department. <br\/><br\/>The second module investigated the elements to be considered in a future model of sexual health and relationship education and heard evidence from representatives in the areas of cybersecurity, consent training, disability and LGBTQI.  The committee undertook to examine the implementation of sexual health and relationship education best practice and, of course, potential solutions.<br\/><br\/>The third module involved the committee hearing evidence from academics and those in the field of delivering sexual health and relationship education.  The purpose of this module was to examine the area of sexual health and relationship policy and its implementation in schools.  In that regard, I visited Trinity College Dublin to experience one of its workshops at first hand.  I was impressed with how it was delivered and with the gender balance, which was approximately 50:50 male and female.<br\/><br\/>The fourth module focused on the role of management boards, including challenges they may encounter in the development and implementation of programmes and, in particular, any impact that ethos may cause.  Overall, the evidence highlighted a need for change in the national mindset with regard to sex education.  It identified that in order to deliver an effective RSE curriculum, a mindset of inclusivity-centred on competence, well-being and the development of mutual satisfying relationships needs to be fostered.<br\/><br\/>I refer to an interesting document published last week by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service that casts a spotlight on school-based RSE.  It was produced separately from the committee's report.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>There is clear evidence that school-based sex education programmes can improve sexual health outcomes. Women who have experienced [appropriate] sex education in schools are less likely to have experienced rape, abortion or distress about sex.<\/blockquote><p>It goes on to discuss research carried out by UNESCO and the World Health Organization, WHO, which claims that &quot;sexuality education leads to improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including a reduction in sexually transmitted infections, (STIs), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and unintended pregnancy&quot;.  It is important to note that.<br\/><br\/>I thank the members of the committee.  We identified that improvements in the curriculum are urgently needed to give young people the skills they need, particularly in the areas of consent and contraception.  The evidence we heard during the four modules highlighted a need for a change in the national mindset.  We must acknowledge and accept that parents are the primary educators of their children but, working hand in hand with schools and the delivery and implementation of an updated RSE policy, we identified that to deliver an effective RSE policy, a mindset of inclusion centred on well-being and the development of mutually satisfying relationships must be fostered.  The committee made 25 recommendations.  We strongly believe that the SPHE and RSE curriculums must be inclusive of all students and give an equal voice to LGBTQI students and those with special intellectual needs, who are often overlooked in this area.  To achieve this, the curricula must be reviewed to reflect today's society and delivered from an earlier age in a consistent manner to all students such that respect for the broad range of sexual identities becomes embedded in the mindset of future generations.<br\/><br\/>I reiterate our recommendation that reproductive will form an integral and fundamental part of all discussions on and reforms of SPHE and RSE.  That also appeared in the recommendations delivered last year by the Citizens' Assembly.  Another important recommendation is that outside providers of RSE should be regulated by the Department of Education and Skills or the HSE to ensure the consistency and accuracy of information provided to students.  In addition, the necessary legislative amendments required to remove the role of ethos as a barrier to the objective and factual delivery of RSE and SPHE curriculums should be made without further delay.<br\/><br\/>I thank all who took part for giving their time, motivation and passion to dealing with this sensitive issue.  They very much helped the committee in forming its views for the report, which was presented to the Minister and the Department on 29 January 2019.  I hope the work undertaken by the committee on this topic will provide our young people with a solid foundation and aid in the success of other initiatives being rolled out as part of the wider discussion related to developing a more respectful and inclusive attitude to sexuality and its impact throughout society.  I hope the Minister will take on board our 25 recommendations.  I ask that he give the committee an opportunity to review the guidelines being compiled by the Department.  I hope it is taking heed of our 25 recommendations in regard to the review.  We would appreciate an opportunity to review the guidelines being drawn up by the Department and to revert at a later stage in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600026#CC00500","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569503700,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I will deal with the Deputy's final point first.  I see no problem with the committee being part of the review process after the NCCA produces the guidelines.  I acknowledge the role of the committee in terms of its observations and contributions.  One thing I have learned from almost a year in this job is that there is a good diversity of opinion on the committee and it is very healthy and important that that is so.  The committee faced challenging issues such as this head on.  I acknowledge the work of its Chairman, Deputy O'Loughlin, and members and note their diligence and contributions on the matter.  I also acknowledge the organisations and individuals who contributed to the work of the committee and, of course, the dedication and diligence of teachers in schools and the work undertaken in pursuit of making RSE fit for Ireland's young people.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence goes hand in glove with this conversation and the production of curriculum guidelines.<\/p><p>Obviously, this work feeds into that.  The clear message, which was referenced, is that we need intergovernmental and inter-agency collaboration on anything we do to prepare our young people for the new challenges that lie ahead.  We must also be honest.  Not all sexual education will happen in the classroom; the majority of it will happen at home.  Young people are exposed to new ways of accessing information, for example with respect to violent behaviour, and new means of communication to get it.  We must be vigilant around that.  <\/p> <p> The NCCA is currently carrying out a review of RSE on foot of a request from my predecessor, Deputy Bruton.  I have asked the NCCA to consider the committee&rsquo;s report as part of that review.  It is important, and the emphasis on collaboration and partnership is critical if we want to get this right.  The review will cover both primary and post-primary levels and include an examination of the experience and reality of RSE delivery in schools and how the RSE curriculum is planned and taught.  At the heart of it is age appropriateness, which the committee referenced in its report, and taking account of the experiences that have been learned over the past 20 years.  We are looking at an outdated and outmoded curriculum.  The curriculum that was taught 20 years ago does not necessarily apply today.  Teachers have evolved in their approach because of the complexities and realities they face in the classroom and, therefore, teaching has changed.  We must listen closely to those excellent teachers who are grappling with this subject in their own way.<\/p> <p> The NCCA review comprises a number of dimensions, namely, a desktop review of recently published research studies, consultation with individuals and organisations working in this area and an online survey to gauge the views of students, parents, teachers, etc.  We will have a live public consultation on this up to 25 October to encourage individuals, groups and parents, many of whom have genuine fears about this to which we must be attentive, who have not contributed to do so.  I encourage all individuals who have fears or concerns in this regard to use that mechanism of consultation.  With respect to hearing the voices of students and parents, we are working hard, through the student and parent charter, to give a legislative voice to young people and parents.  Unfortunately, that legislative mechanism will not be in place in time for this report in respect of which we hope to publish the guidelines by the end of the year.  It is important we continue to be vigilant about capturing the voices of the students and the parents and listening closely to the experiences of teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600027#DD00200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569504300,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Minister but Members are anxious to get a copy of the his script.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600028#EE00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1569504300,"counter":312,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600028#EE00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1569504300,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Is it available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600028#EE00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1569504300,"counter":314,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il.  Th&aacute;inig m&eacute; amach &oacute; chruinni&uacute; Rialtais.  I just came from a Government meeting.  I apologise for this.  I am digressing a good bit so what I am saying it not exactly what is in the script.  I am adopting my usual delivery.<\/p><p>The NCCA is also working directly with schools to examine the experience of RSE in the classroom.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Within every school, the student body studies a hierarchy of subjects on the basis of the prominence of one subject over the other.  In terms of status, we need to ensure RSE is accepted as an important priority subject when we get this together.  It is fundamental for people who are learning to grapple with the challenges of life but it is also fundamental to the personal development of young people as they go through the student cycle, be it in primary or secondary school.<\/p><p>  The NCCA review, which took place between June 2018 and March 2019, addresses the key issues raised in the joint committee's report.  The report has contributed greatly to the evidence gathering process for the NCCA review, and that diverse opinion is important.  The consultation process is open until 25 October.  I reiterate that no decision will be made on this curriculum until that report is delivered.  There is still time for people&rsquo;s voices to be heard.  Today, I encouraged my colleagues in the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality to pass on the formal findings and challenges they have in their Departments, whether it be it in the area of health, nutrition, domestic violence or consent.  Those Departments have a role to play and it is important their voices are formally communicated to the NCCA.<\/p><p>  It is appropriate that the time has been taken to carry out a major review of the way we educate our young people about relationships and sexuality.  Issues such as contraception, sexuality and consent need to be taught in a way that not only acknowledges our changing society but also addresses issues that arise in society that indicate a lack of understanding of these issues.  Understanding them is fundamental.  Consent is not just about how we treat other people, it is also about how we respect ourselves and other individuals.  My personal belief is that to respect others, one must start to respect oneself while understanding what is appropriate and not appropriate and what is right and wrong behaviour.  That can be taught at an early stage.  <\/p><p>It is vitally important that our education system prepares our young people for life in a society that values each individual&rsquo;s sexual orientation, respects decisions regarding contraception and understands consent.  We all recognise relationship and sexuality education in this country.  It must be fit for purpose and meet the needs of our young people in a modern Ireland.  With that caveat, we hold very close to our hearts the proud tradition of a legacy of education, which holds the fundamentals very close to us.  They will continue to be front and centre of anything that appears new in a curriculum.  That is to do with respect, dignity, compassion and the fundamentals of understanding.<\/p><p>  There is a great deal of uncertainty about what is currently taught in schools in RSE.  Currently, schools are obliged to teach all elements of the curriculum.  No element can be omitted on the grounds of school ethos or characteristic spirit.  SPHE and RSE are integral parts of the new well-being programme in the junior cycle.  Every student in our schools has a right to access information about sexual health, relationships and sexuality.<\/p><p>  We acknowledge the commitment of teachers and recognise their professional expertise in dealing with this difficult topic.  We also must ensure that whatever road we go down, they have the required capacity, training and continuous professional development.  I am encouraged constantly by the yearning and appetite among the teaching community to equip themselves with the specific skills needed to deal with so many complex issues.  I attended an event this morning in Athlone Education Centre where I heard at first hand their hunger to work with their colleagues and enable them to be equipped to do the job they need to do.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the extensive resource materials prepared by a number of organisations to support the implementation of the curriculum in areas concerning RSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600028#EE00500","speaker":"1290"}]
