He is joined by Mr. Brian Hill, senior auditor.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering, Farrell and Cassells.<\/p> <p>  We will hold the minutes of the previous meeting over until next week.  Therefore, we will deal next week with anything in the minutes and matters arising.<\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first category is A, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Nos. 2293A and 2297A are from Mr. Conor O'Kelly, CEO, National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  These are his opening statement and briefing documents.  We will note and publish these.  That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2296 A from the HSE, dated 3 July, is a briefing statement for today's meeting on the State Claims Agency.  We will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  The second category is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee and other items for publishing.  We have held over a couple of items from the previous meeting.  The first is No. 2161B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May, enclosing a report on the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities which was undertaken by Mazars.  We published this a couple of weeks ago and there was an indication that some people would like to make some observations.  If anyone wants to make an observation on that, that is fine, and if not, we will circulate it.  If somebody wants to bring it back up the next time under minutes or matters arising, we will do so.  I would like to deal with it formally today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  People can raise the matter again the next day, if they want, before the break.<\/p> <p>  No. 2277B is from Ms Mary Lawlor, communications and public affairs manager, National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, dated 26 June, responding to further information requested by the committee on the payment of &euro;1.9 million to the Revenue Commissioners in 2018.  At our meeting of 13 June we reviewed the 2018 accounts for NAMA and highlighted this payment to the Revenue Commissioners in November 2018 in respect of an underpayment of VAT on certain services received from abroad.  The payment included &euro;600,000 in respect of interests and penalties.  NAMA advised that the liability arose primarily in respect of a NAMA secured asset located abroad where invoices were settled directly with debtors, by debtors or their lawyers.  These invoices were processed externally and were not subject to the normal internal processes for assessing whether a reverse charge VAT obligation arises.  NAMA advised that it has amended its procedures to capture in real time any reverse charge VAT liability due.  We will note and publish this.  NAMA has clarified the matter in full.  I stress that it was a voluntary disclosure by NAMA in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  No. 2284B is from Mr. Maurice Buckley, Chairman, Office of Public Works, dated 27 June, providing an update requested by the committee on the basis of the measurement to determine the rent on Miesian Plaza in Baggot Street, which is the head office for the Department of Health.  A meeting is expected in the coming weeks with the landlord.  We will note and publish this.  We will get an update on that in due course as well.<\/p> <p>  No. 2291B is from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, dated 1 July.  Dr. Lynch is working on providing follow-up information requested at our recent meeting with the Department and has suggested a format for providing information on Pobal.  The letter contains a template for how the Department proposes to provide the information.  Unless any member can suggest an alternative layout in terms of the presentation of the information, I propose that we advise Dr. Lynch to proceed as suggested.  The reason we have done this is because an enormous volume of information was requested at the meeting and we want to make the flow of information in some way manageable, and they want to agree a format with us.  I am happy to proceed with this.  When we get the information, if we want further information again thereafter, we can revisit the matter.  For now we will ask them to provide the information based on the template that they have provided here today.  That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2292B is from Ms Marie Mulvihill, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 28 June, providing information requested at our meeting last week on the health budget oversight group.  We will note and publish this.  The matter arose as a result of recent correspondence that a health budget oversight group had been established, which people might not have been aware of and we might have seen reference to it.  We think it is a good thing and follows on from a previous recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts in our last periodic report where we stated that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should engage directly with those Departments that have a history of a substantial requirement for Supplementary Estimates.  The Department is acting on that but perhaps it was going to do so in any event.  It has set up the membership of the health budget oversight committee.  Officials confirmed here at the previous meeting that the group is only dealing with current expenditure and does not include capital expenditure.  We would suggest that the group would also cover that.  In the meantime, it is good that there is an oversight group to work on this issue.  I will list the membership of the committee so that people will know its make-up: Mr. Ronnie Downes is the chairperson, and he is an assistant secretary in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; Mr. Colin Menton is an assistant secretary in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; Mr. Colm O'Riordan is a deputy secretary in the Department of Health; Mr. Colm Desmond is an assistant secretary in the Department of Health; Mr. Stephen Mulvany is the chief financial officer of the HSE; Mr. Liam Woods is the national director and chief operations officer in the HSE; and Ms Rosarii Mannion is the national director of human resources in the HSE.  The secretariat is provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am delighted to see that there is such a group in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Except for gender, the list is perfectly right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I noticed the gender balance as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The committee is 100% male.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Nearly, except for Ms Rosarii Mannion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Yes.

We will pass our observation on to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, as he is the man in charge.  I thank the Deputies for the observation.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 2294B from the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 2 July, providing a notice on the sentence calculation review carried out on behalf of the Irish Prison Service.  We will note and publish this item.  It will be included in our periodic report that we will publish next week.<\/p><p>A detailed review of that particular issue has been conducted, and we were satisfied to receive that.<br\/><br\/>No. 2295B is from William Beausang, Department of Education and Skills.  He has provided an update on responses received by the Department from Waterford IT arising from matters related to the spin-out company FeedHenry.  We will note and publish this item and it will feed into our periodic report.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <br\/><br\/>Category C relates to private individuals and other correspondence.  One item has been held over from previous meetings and I want to do a detailed note on that because we have a number of letters on this issue from this particular correspondent.  It is their right to correspond with this committee.  No. 2260C, dated 18 June, is further correspondence from an individual about the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  We considered correspondence from this individual at our meeting on 13 June 2019.  The matters raised appeared to involve a breach of legislation and it was agreed to advise the individual that the matters raised were not within the remit of the committee, but were a policy or legislation issue.  In this item, the correspondent states that he intends to make a further submission to the committee.  We have previously written to both the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners on matters raised by the correspondent regarding bogus self-employment.  We sent responses to the correspondent, which were received, in June 2018.  The Department advised in 2018 that it had published a review of trends in, and issues arising from, the use of intermediary structures and self-employment arrangements, together with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners<font color=\"#808080\">.  <\/font>The report considered the available data on employment trends, including data used in the correspondent's submission, and concluded that there was little, if any, evidence that there has been an increase in the level of what is termed &quot;disguised or false self-employment&quot;.  The report made a number of recommendations.  One recommendation was to increase public awareness of the services provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's scope section, and a public awareness campaign about false self-employment was launched in May of last year.<br\/><br\/>I propose we inform the correspondent that our consideration of the matter is closed, in light of the fact that various State organisations have dealt with the information.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2279C is from Mr. John Conway, assistant secretary of Louth Environmental Group.  It is dated 27 June 2019, and is a response to correspondence we sent to the group which was received from the Office of Public Works, OPW, following inquiries made by the committee regarding a flood risk project at Bellurgan, Dundalk, County Louth.  I propose to advise the group to make contact with the Local Government Audit Service as the work was carried by Louth County Council, but members may also wish to take this matter up with the OPW when it is next before the committee giving its financial statements.We will note this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2280C is a response from an individual to our recent correspondence to him regarding salaries and allowances for Oireachtas Members.  We will note this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2281C, dated 24 June 2019, is from an individual responding to our recent correspondence to him and to our discussion of his correspondence in respect of Kerry County Council.  The correspondent says we misunderstood the point he was making, which was about the value for money of discretionary funds that are made available to councillors.  Nonetheless, our position remains that the matters raised are not within the remit of the committee and I propose to reiterate that he should make his inquiry to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2283C, dated 27 June 2019, is from Mr. Allen Morgan, enclosing further correspondence following our private meeting on 20 June 2019.  Mr. Morgan is a retired senior official from the OPW with extensive experience, having worked in the organisation for years.  We met him in private session to discuss a number of projects he wanted to highlight.  In response to queries from members, Mr. Morgan has provided further documentation and, in summary, he recommends that the lessons learned from the Miesian Plaza case should be embedded in all OPW projects.  On the transfer of the property remit from the OPW to a dedicated agency-type organisation, he cites the example of Coillte and other European comparator countries where there is a more commercially focused agency approach.  He also recommends greater and more clearly independent oversight or scrutiny of property cases, especially while these remain within OPW&rsquo;s remit.  Members will agree that there is merit in exploring these recommendations further.  However, it is not within the remit of the committee to do so, because almost everything Mr. Morgan refers to is a policy matter for the relevant Minister.  I propose that we forward this correspondence, with his permission, to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, as it deals with the OPW, and it is under that committee's remit to consider policy matters.  We will ask for its consideration and any action it deems appropriate.  Members may also wish to raise the matter in other fora.  Is that agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B01400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>What committee are we sending it to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#C00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, as that committee deals with the OPW.

At our meeting on 13 June, we decided to forward a number of items of correspondence in respect of this company to the OPW for a response.  The secretariat routinely requests the correspondent's permission and, in this instance, the company has declined to provide consent for this purpose.  The matter relates to specifications for cell windows in Garda stations and courthouses.  The correspondent believes the winning tenders are not meeting the health and safety specifications set out in the tender documents.  I propose to write to both the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ask if they are completely satisfied that the health and safety standards and specifications for the supply and fitting of cell windows are being met.  I propose that we also ask the OPW to describe the controls in place to ensure the winning tenders deliver the specification set out in tender documents.  In conversation with one of the correspondents, the clerk to the committee was given to understand that the matter has also been referred to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  I propose we write to the HSA for an update on the matter.  The company does not want us to send its correspondence on directly, but to raise the general issue of tendering so that what is in the tender document is subsequently delivered, and that the mechanisms to do that are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#C01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We should also draw the State Claims Agency's attention to it, because there is a risk assessment aspect to its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#C01400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Representatives from the agency will be before the committee later, so we might raise it with them then.

However, it has recognised &euro;3.75 million more than is warranted for a funding agreement it entered with the Higher Education Authority.  Otherwise, the financial statements give a true and fair view.  On a separate point, it is noted that the university had non-compliant procurement to the value of &euro;2.9 million in 2016 and 2017.  It is unusual for the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualify an audit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#D01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>It is and we do not do it lightly.

These are the type of issues that will arise.<\/p><p>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>As members are aware, the National Treasury Management Agency is a complex organisation with multiple functions that extend beyond its original and core role of managing Ireland&rsquo;s national debt.  The set of financial statements before the committee this morning reflects the various statutory obligations of the agency in respect of its financial reporting.  The NTMA&rsquo;s primary function is to manage borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the national debt account.  At the end of 2018, the gross national debt stood at slightly more than &euro;205 billion.  This was an increase of more than &euro;6.5 billion on the gross national debt at the end of 2017.  Total debt servicing costs in 2018 amounted to &euro;6 billion.  This was 4% less than in the previous year, reflecting the impact of refinancing of debt at prevailing low interest rates.<\/p> <p>  Other key functions and services of the NTMA that are accounted for separately include management of compensation claims on behalf of certain State authorities in its capacity as the State Claims Agency, management of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and provision of procurement and financial advice in respect of certain public private partnerships and other large capital projects in its capacity as the National Development Finance Agency.  <\/p> <p>  The financial statements of the State Claims Agency indicate claims settlements on behalf of State agencies in 2018 amounting to slightly more than &euro;250 million, with associated expenses of &euro;104 million.  This expenditure, totalling &euro;354 million, was recovered from the State agencies involved and represented an increase of almost 12% on the 2017 level.  The agency&rsquo;s estimate of the value of claims liabilities outstanding at end 2018 was &euro;3.15 billion, up 18% from the estimate of &euro;2.66 billion at the end of 2017.  As members are aware, almost three quarters of the estimated claims value outstanding relates to clinical claims.  <\/p> <p>  The financial statements of the ISIF show a reduction of &euro;3.6 billion in the value of the fund assets between the end of 2017 and the end of 2018.  The loss in value that occurred in 2018 is related to a significant fall in the value of the fund&rsquo;s shareholdings in AIB and Bank of Ireland, which comprise a portfolio invested in by the fund at the direction of the Minister for Finance.  The audit report on the ISIF financial statements draws attention to the NTMA statement on internal control, which discloses a weakness in controls relating to foreign currency hedging that resulted in a loss of &euro;721,000 in the year.  The agency has since introduced enhanced controls in that area.  <\/p> <p>  The NTMA assigns staff and provides certain other support services, on a reimbursement basis, to certain independent bodies, including the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and, since 2018, Home Building Finance Ireland.  These are governed by separate boards and the NTMA is not accountable for their activities.  The NTMA also provides staff on secondment for the Department of Finance&rsquo;s banking unit, with the costs in that case being carried by the NTMA.  <\/p> <p>  The NTMA&rsquo;s administration account shows gross expenditure on administration costs totalled &euro;127.2 million in 2018.  Of this total, &euro;46.7 million or 37% was recovered from NAMA and the SBCI.  Overall, staff costs accounted for around 79% of the expenditure in the year.  All staff are employees of the NTMA, including those assigned to work for the supported agencies.  As explained in note 7.3 of the administration account, the agency operated a voluntary redundancy scheme during 2018 at a cost of &euro;2.6 million.  This is separate from the voluntary redundancy and retention scheme operated for NAMA staff, which cost a further &euro;1.8 million.<\/p> <p>  The audit report on the NTMA administration account draws attention to expenditure of &euro;5.9 million in 2018 relating to contracts that were not publicly advertised.  The NTMA&rsquo;s statement on internal control provides explanations for the procurement approach adopted in relation to those contracts.<\/p> <p>  Pursuant to section 28 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000, the Minister for Finance delegated to the NTMA a range of functions in respect of the Ireland Apple escrow fund, including the production of annual financial statements, which are subject to audit by me.  The first set of financial statements for the fund were prepared for the period 17 May 2018 to 31 December 2018.  These are published separately from the other NTMA accounts.  Between May and September 2018, Apple paid amounts totalling &euro;14.285 billion into the escrow fund.  The net assets of the fund at year end were &euro;14.269 billion, representing a decline in value of &euro;16 million.  Operating expenses of &euro;2 million were incurred during 2018 in respect of investment management and other fees and expenses.  The remainder of the loss in value in the period of account is attributed to the current negative interest rate environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and call Mr. O'Kelly to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and committee for the opportunity to present before it.<\/p><p>The committee has received my opening statement, which I do not intend to read.  We have also provided some slides which I will use only for the discussion of the national debt, if that is all right.  It would probably be easier to go through that with the slides in front of us.  I will give a quick overview of some of the businesses in Vote 2018, our outlook for the markets and what is informing our views of strategy and decision-making at the current time.  I thank the board of the NTMA and, in particular, our former chairman, Willie Walsh, who stepped down at the end of 2018 having been there since the beginning of 2015 on the newly constructed board.  I thank him for his contribution.  We have seven excellent non-executives and a new chairman, Maeve Carton, former chief financial officer of CRH.  We are very fortunate to have this quality of non-executives, who give us plenty of support and challenge.  I also acknowledge the Committee of Public Accounts and the challenge it has given us, particularly in the areas of diversity, tobacco and fossil fuels.  It is fair to say the committee has kept those issues high on our agenda over the last few years.  We have made some progress there and we still have plenty to do.  I wanted at the outset to acknowledge the contribution and challenge of the committee in that regard.<\/p><p> I will start with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  The key fact is that for 2018, the ISIF lost 1% in value.  Members will be aware that 2018 was one of the worst years for stock markets since the early 1920s.  The S&amp;P 500, the US index, was down 6% and the Irish stock market was down 22%.  Virtually all asset classes lost money and were in negative territory in that year.  The ISIF exposure to global equities meant that overall it lost 1% of its value.  I am glad to say that markets have recovered very significantly in 2019 and all of that loss - and then some - has been recovered.  In total, since the ISIF was first instituted, a total of &euro;850 million in investment gains have been added to the value of the portfolio.  That is a return of 2.3% annually on the money, which is invested across Ireland with some exposure to global markets, as that cash remains to be invested in the mandate.  A 2.3% return when we are borrowing money at an average of less than 1% is pretty good business for the State to date.<\/p><p> One of the other key features of the ISIF is that we always co-invest in any of the investments we make.  The &euro;4.4 billion we have committed to the Irish market since inception has been matched by &euro;8.1 billion in private investment.  That means a total of &euro;12.5 billion has been invested in the Irish economy right across all the different sectors and regions.  I do not want to outline all the investments we made this year; they are listed in the annual report.  Investments were made at a rate of about one every two weeks in total, with over &euro;700 million deployed in the year.  I will come back to the rate of deployment a little bit later on.  Investments included MilkFlex, a fund which provides financing to dairy farmers, Shannon Airport, the Port of Cork, Green Isle Foods, Donegal Catch and Vectra, a company which uses artificial intelligence to provide cybersecurity and which has set up a Dublin office.  Vectra has already employed more than 40 people following our investment.  We invested across the alternative energy space in 2018, backing a fund called Temporis Capital, which is set to commit and develop alternative energy, as much as 1,000 MW, which is almost 25% of Ireland's total requirement in that space.  We have also backed a solar energy company in the last 12 months.  Another feature of the ISIF to which I referred springs from legislation enacted by the Oireachtas in respect of fossil fuels.  The ISIF has divested of the 38 holdings it had in fossil fuel stocks and additionally has produced an exclusion list of 148 stocks in which it is precluded from investing under the Act.<\/p><p> The fund has had a review and tries to be adaptable to economic conditions.  It was set up in 2015, when the economy was in a different position and there was more of a shortage of the kind of capital that we have.  We have been adapting over those years and always look to be flexible in terms of moving with the times.  We are not there to replace other capital that is available; we have to go where capital does not flow as easily as that is the purpose of the fund.  That is what we call the dead weight test.  If other capital is available, we will not invest.  As the economy has recovered and there is a lot of capital available, we have found ourselves more in the space of tenure, meaning the term of the investment we are prepared to make.  There is lots of private equity and investment capital for a term of five or seven years, but going out to ten, 12 or 15 years there is very little capital available.  We find ourselves now engaged in projects that have a much longer-term horizon and focus.  That is probably where the committee is going to see more of our activities over the coming year to 24 months.  I also suspect we will deploy less capital than we did in the initial four years of the fund, when we deployed between &euro;700 million and &euro;800 million per annum.  The size of the projects is beginning to decline.  Many of the projects that were pent up from the crisis have come into our portfolio.  As we normalise and as other capital is becoming available, I see the deployment rate declining somewhat.  This is a good thing.  If there is other capital available, that is good news and probably reflects where we are in the cycle.  We do not have to spend the money.  We are not anxious to spend it.  We only want to invest the money if it is good value for the State and makes that economic impact.  If the money is not invested, it is still an asset of the State and sits on the balance sheet as an asset.<\/p><p> There has been excess surplus in the fund, which stands at &euro;9.4 billion now.  There is &euro;4.4 billion in Irish investments, which leaves us with &euro;5.1 billion.  As the committee is aware, &euro;3.5 billion of that has been reallocated by the current Government, with &euro;1.5 billion going into the rainy day fund, &euro;750 million allocated to Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, and &euro;1.25 billion to the Land Development Agency, LDA.  That sum has been taken away, as it were, as excess reserve to be used elsewhere by the State, reducing the overall size of the ISIF.  The &euro;4.4 billion will already start to recycle because some of the investments are already yielding returns in the shape of dividends and even capital to the fund.  The idea is that it becomes an evergreen fund and funds itself to be able to grow and invest long into the future.  That is the ambition.<\/p><p> The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, provides advice in respect of most big projects and particularly public-private partnerships, PPPs.  We have had a lot of discussion of PPPs at this committee over the years.  We had probably the most significant year of real challenge and stress in respect of the collapse of Carillion in the UK, one of the biggest liquidations of a project management construction firm in that country's history.  It has had a devastating effect across many projects in the UK.  Carillion was only involved in one project in Ireland, which we call \"schools bundle 5\".  That was the building of six schools in Wicklow, Wexford and Meath.  It was an interesting test of the PPP model.  One of the discussions around PPPs is whether the risk transfers to the private sector; does the private sector really take the risk or, when something happens, does the State ends up picking up the tab.  In this case, four of the schools are already open although they were a year delayed.  The rest of the schools will open this September but there will be no additional cost to the taxpayer.  That PPP contract has completely stood up and remained intact.  From the taxpayer point of view, no additional cost has been incurred.  The equity providers and financiers of that PPP contract have lost all their equity money and have had to take a lower return.  That is the purpose of that contract when we transfer risk, and there is a cost associated with it.  The idea is that in theory, when a stress event occurs, they do own the risk.  It is an interesting real-life example where the PPP contract stood up.  At a time when we have many projects to construct, it is worth reflecting on the robustness of that contract in that particular live situation.<\/p><p> I will touch on NewERA, which is in many ways the in-house corporate finance adviser to the State.  It has advised on 132 different projects, acquisitions or disposals of commercial semi-State companies.  NewERA tries to bring together all of the assets owned by the State under one umbrella in the context of the shareholder so that the State has consistent analysis of investment criteria, return on capital and dividend policy.  NewERA brings them all to account in a similar and consistent fashion.  The mandate that the team is being asked to deliver advice on continues to grow.  There were 132 advisory projects done on behalf of the State for different Departments and clients this year.  That figure is up from 81 in 2017.<\/p><p> Representatives from the State Claims Agency are with us and I know we have a separate session on that work but I will touch on it.  There are 146 State bodies with more than 200,000 employees.  Considerable footfall goes through there.  Earlier, the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that the vast majority of the 1,500 claims are clinical in value terms.  The provision is &euro;3.15 billion.  This is the current estimated liability and 74% of that is provided for the clinical sector.<\/p><p> We deal with and have dealt with many sad and difficult cases in the State Claims Agency.  That is the nature of the mandate.  However, we have never before had a situation like we have had in 2018.  I know we are going to discuss extensive technicalities and legal positions today but it has to be seen in the light of the extraordinary devastation and grief caused to so many women by this situation.  There are no good outcomes.  We and the team try to walk that line as sensitively as we can but it is not an easy task.  It all pales in comparison to the grief and devastation caused to the women involved in the overall issue.<\/p><p> Apple has been mentioned.  The first financial results for the Apple fund were announced yesterday and released by the Department of Finance.  As committee members are aware, the National Treasury Management Agency was directed by the Minister to establish the escrow fund to essentially look after those funds while the legal case is going on.  Apple and the NTMA jointly have an investment policy.  A sum of &euro;14.2 billion sits now in an investment account of which the NTMA and Apple have oversight.  The easiest way to describe it is as a conservative cash box of sorts.  The purpose of the fund is a return of capital rather than a return on capital.  That is the focus of the fund.  It is about capital preservation.  The fund has been established and it is currently operating satisfactorily.<\/p><p> I will turn to the slides to discuss the debt.  It might be easier to talk through from slide 16.  The slides cover the positives and negatives or challenges.  I will touch on each of these in turn.  On the left hand side of the slide we are looking at the positives of the national debt and the servicing of the debt.  Committee members can see the so-called chimneys or refinancing stacks of 2018, 2019 and 2020.  We have talked about these at the committee during previous years.  It is fair to say at this point, when we are exactly half-way through the refinancing period, that we can safely put the refinancing risk that has existed behind us because of what has happened.  I will come to that in more detail in a moment.  The debt has been smoothed out in terms of the future profile of maturities.  There are no such refinancing cliffs ahead in the foreseeable future.  That is important from a debt management point of view; it is important to have a smooth profile.<\/p><p> The interest bill continues to fall.  I will come back to that again.  The interest bill has fallen from &euro;7.5 billion in 2014 to a projected &euro;4.5 billion next year.  I will come back to the reasons that saving has been so dramatic.  It is largely due to the interest rate environment we are in.<\/p><p> I want to touch on diversification.  Ireland issued its first green bond in 2018, becoming only the fourth European sovereign country to do so.  I will come back to the rationale behind that as well.<\/p><p> The debt is still elevated though.  That is still a significant issue.  It is four times what it was in the 2000s before the financial crisis.  We have paid a very significant amount of interest.  People may have heard me say that we have paid &euro;33 billion in interest over the past five years.  This interest bill is enormous.  We paid &euro;60 billion in interest over the last decade.  That compares to &euro;20 billion in the previous decade.  That is all to do with the elevated amount of debt rather than the rate of interest, which many people concentrate on.  Some may suggest that since rates are so low we should borrow more etc.  We have to remember that it is the stock of debt that is really significant in this regard for Ireland.<\/p><p> We rely on foreign capital for the largest portion, 90%, of our borrowings.  That is unusual versus other European and global sovereigns.  It makes us slightly more vulnerable than others to financial markets.  Of course there are significant external risks on the horizons of which committee members are well aware.<\/p><p> Before 2018 we talked about the refinancing chimneys to the tune of &euro;60 billion.  In the first instance we repaid the International Monetary Fund and that reduced the size of the chimneys.  Since then, we have repaid the 2018 bond that matured.  That was a &euro;9 billion bond and it matured in October 2018.  We have also repaid the &euro;7 billion bond in June, some weeks ago.  There is another maturity of &euro;6 billion in October.  There is a &euro;10 billion maturity coming early next year.  Then there is a final maturity of &euro;6 billion in October 2020.  That will remove the chimneys completely.  However, given the cash we have already raised and the repayments we have already made of those maturities, we can say now for the first time that the refinancing risks of those chimneys is now behind us.  This is because of what we have already repaid and the cash we have already raised at today's market rates.  The key thing about the coupons that we have been repaying is that a total of five large bonds fell due over a short period.  The range of coupons was from 4.4% to 5.9%.  They are the really high coupons and they are all retiring.  We are replacing them with debt that is 1% and under.  That is where the big savings come from.  That is why the savings really start to fall post 2020.  It is why this refinancing period was so important for us.  It was important for us to be able to try to lock in today's interest rate environment while we had that significant need.  We can now put that risk safety behind us.<\/p><p> Let us consider the profile now.  The debt manager normally looks three or four years ahead.  We were looking at 2018, 2019 and 2020 in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  Now we are looking ahead to 2022, 2023 and 2024.  Committee members will see the smoother profile of maturities.  That represents a far lower risk profile from the point of view of the State in terms of maturing debt over the long period and looking out to the future.<\/p><p> Earlier I said the interest bill was &euro;7.5 billion and is down to &euro;4.5 billion.  There are three reasons this has occurred.  First, and most important, is the interest rate environment created by the European Central Bank quantitative easing and the extraordinary low interest rate environment.  Committee members do not necessarily watch financial markets in the same way that we do, but since Christine Lagarde's potential appointment as the ECB President, interest rates have fallen dramatically during the past 48 hours and there has been a dramatic move lower in bond market yields.  She is considered to be a dovish ECB President potentially versus some of the alternatives.  The market has reacted and moved rates even lower.  The interest rate environment looks like it will remain low at least for the foreseeable future.  This extraordinary low interest rate environment happened at a time when Ireland had its greatest refinancing needs and at a time when the credit rating of the country was improving.  These three things came together and this environment has enabled Ireland to save so much interest.<\/p><p>Those high coupons all fall away and get replaced by lower ones.  That is why the savings are so significant.  I will revert to why that will not always be the case in a moment.<\/p><p> Some of the Deputies are interested in the topic of the green bond.  While it is good news from the point of view of leadership and ensuring that sustainable projects get delivered and identified, the NTMA has a slightly narrow way of looking at it.  This is the fastest growing pool of capital in the world.  We are accessing new investors by issuing green bonds.  From a funding perspective, that helps to diversify the risk.  One of the few ways we can diversify and mitigate our risk is to widen the investor base that owns Irish bonds.  When we issued our first green bond, more than 50% of the investors who bought it and loaned us money had never invested in Ireland before.  Besides the ability to finance sustainable projects, that was the attraction for us.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the other side of the balance sheet with the negatives and challenges.  This is our gross debt, which has effectively remained unchanged since the crisis.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, it stands at &euro;205 billion currently.  Let us just call it over &euro;200 billion.  It is four times what it was in the 2000s.  I describe this as a mountain of debt, and there is only one way to get down a mountain, that being, very slowly and carefully and without taking alternative routes or going back up the mountain.  We must try to find a way to reduce this debt over time.  That will only happen slowly, but we must stick to the path and do that.  The risks to the country of having very high debt levels are the risks that any of us would have as individuals, householders or businesses in the event of a downturn, in that we would obviously be more vulnerable.  It is no different for a sovereign.<\/p><p> Regarding debt, by comparison with our European peers and other countries, we rate poorly in some of these statistics.  The European average is shown at the bottom of the table.  I draw members' attention to our debt-to-Government revenue figure, which is still at 251% and one of the highest in Europe.  Although our interest bill has reduced as a percentage of Government revenue to 6%, it is still way higher than our European peers.  Even at today's interests and with the savings we have made, that is where it still ranks among our European peers.  Ireland is not in a good position from a debt point of view.  We must continue to bear that in mind and be vigilant.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the interest bill dating back to the mid-2000s.  I showed how it was falling from &euro;7.5 billion to &euro;4.5 billion, but that will still be three times what it was in the 2003-08 period.  Even though interest rates then were 4% and are less than 1% today, our current interest bill is three times what it was in that period because of the size of our debt.<\/p><p> I will show how challenging that will be in future.  Consider the bonds that are now going to mature.  I mentioned bonds maturing with high coupon rates.  One of the bonds that will mature in 2022 was issued by us in 2017 and has a 0% coupon.  The chances of the NTMA refinancing that bond in 2022 at a lower interest rate are slim.  That is why we will be refinancing through low-coupon bonds and unlikely to make savings in future.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the investors from whom we borrowed this sizeable amount of debt.  They are all overseas, which is unusual.  There is not a large domestic savings market for our bonds.  This makes us particularly vulnerable.  These investors can change their minds quickly, move away and charge us more.  Our reputation, creditworthiness and positioning in the marketplace are important.  Obviously, we are quite exposed.<\/p><p> I will not necessarily go into the challenges ahead that are listed on the next slide in any detail, although we can take some questions.  Our investors are telling us that they are worried about Brexit and corporation tax changes.  The financial markets are concerned and are looking at Italy and some of the challenges it faces from a debt perspective.  The spreads in Italy are volatile at the moment.<\/p><p> That concludes my presentation.  I am happy to take members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Kelly.

We have 10,658 outstanding claims that we are managing at a potential cost of &euro;3.15 billion.  Clinical claims amount to 3,196, which is a &euro;2.33 billion estimated liability.  That is 30% by volume terms, in terms of the number of claims, and yet representing 74% of the potential cost.  On the general side, we have 7,462 claims that are active at a cost of &euro;820 million.  They are the employers and public liability and property damage claims against the State.<\/p> <p>  Our total transactional expenditure is the amount of money that we spend in a particular calendar year across both schemes, that is, the clinical indemnity scheme and the general indemnity scheme.  In 2017, that was &euro;303 million and in 2018, it went up to &euro;347 million.  One reason that has climbed in the way it has is due to things like claims inflation and the factoring in of the Gill Russell case, which is the case dealing with the discount rate and the calculation of special damages.  In addition, we are setting and resolving more claims as well.<\/p> <p>  Our clinical claims resolved in the year 2018 came to approximately &euro;247 million, compared with &euro;134 million in the previous year.  If I could explain the &euro;92 million gap, about which members might wonder, we have set it out in our annual report that it is due to the Gill Russell uplifts.  These were cases that we had settled on the basis of the higher discount rate and when the Court of Appeal gave its judgment, we had to pay at the lower rate.  Consequently, there were differences to be paid on some claims that we had settled and that amounted to &euro;65 million.  The awards over &euro;1 million jumped from 20 in 2017 to 56 in 2018 and then we had other awards and settlements; we just simply had at a higher number, up from 42 to 59.  That is probably the overall pen picture of the statistics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Please explain the discount rate.

The Gill Russell case, which we handled, was a catastrophic injury case to an infant in which the rate was reduced based on economic advice that was available to the court at the time.

This debate is a continuation of a topic that we discussed here last year.  We did not to complete it because there was so much information being sought from the HSE on the number and category of claims.  We sought information for the public watching by hospital in an effort to see whether hospitals had a higher risk.  There was an assessment from the agency that were such a league to be published, then it could potentially be misleading or unfairly damaging to some hospitals just because of the number of people presenting.  We agreed to not go into that detail because it could have other knock-on consequences.  We then mentioned hospital groups as an issue.  When the agency was here on the last day, we had quite a bit of information to receive on an ongoing basis thereafter and we said we would come back to it again this year.  We are really only in a follow-through mode, somewhere along the line, from the HSE.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for our colleagues in the Department  of Health and the HSE, more so than the State Claims Agency.  What is being done to reduce the amount of medical negligence cases in the health service?  We are here having this meeting not because the State Claims Agency has a cost of &euro;3 billion but because of medical negligence in hospitals and other HSE footings.  Really the question should start and begin with the Department and the HSE because that is the source of where all of the issues have happened.  We have talked about this over the past year and we have been given a report today for today's meeting.  Can somebody talk to me from the HSE's perspective on the proactive measures that have been taken?  We heard here the last time that an incident can happen in a hospital, a report is compiled locally, which is not a ministerial one, but there is no proper mechanism to share the lessons and so on beyond that hospital in some cases.  Sometimes it might have been the group.  Sometimes, if a more serious event is being examined, the results might be circulated to all of the hospital managers but nobody seems to know whether they even have time to look at these things when they do get them.  The number of claims increases every year.  Our question is, in the first instance, more directed at the health service rather than the State Claims Agency.  We will just take an observation from the witnesses at this stage and we will then move on to the substance of the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>By the time it becomes a claim, it is at the very end of a process so it may be a number of years on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>On what we tried to illustrate in the report, we know already there are big areas of risk in terms of harm that happens in the health service.

In the report, I tried to set out for members some of the big areas of harm we know that have happened.  Really then, we should be way ahead of it in terms of prevention.  I then have a particular interest in when incidents happen.  We know that a lot of people go the legal route for a number of reasons.  One is, in particular, that they do not feel they have got the answers to what went wrong.  I have met a number of patients who have been harmed.

They told me that one of the reasons they went to court was that they did not get the information and were not told what had happened.  They had very simple questions, namely, what happened, why did it happen and what had been done to fix it.  They wanted to know that it was not going to happen to anyone else.<\/p><p> We work closely with the State Claims Agency, not only when it comes to claims but also in incident reporting.  The national incident management system was established by the State Claims Agency but is owned by the public service.  In the four years since its establishment, we have seen a 33% increase in the number of incidents reported.  That is a good thing, although it may seem counter-intuitive, because any health system with a healthy patient safety culture will report incidents.  That includes incidents where no harm has been caused at all, which may be negligible or which may have had no impact on the person involved.  Good incident reporting leads to good learning at the outset.  Any health system in the world encourages reporting because assuming that increased numbers are an indication of poorer safety takes from the culture of patient safety in hospitals, institutions or community services.  That has been a big success.  While the State Claims Agency can answer for itself, I think it would point to that as being very significant.  It allows us to see the trends in incidents, whether at a local level in a hospital, community service or hospital group, or at national level.  That is just one part of it.<\/p><p> Only 1% of the incidents reported are considered major or extreme.  These are incidents that result in serious harm to people and, in some cases, people die as a result.  We do not want to wait until a claim is lodged to get people to start looking at why it happened.  With category 1 incidents, where that level of harm has occurred, there is a requirement to review them and understand what happened, not after two or three months but immediately.  If another person coming in to that facility today will face a risk, that risk has to be sorted and the factors that led to the incident have to be identified.  As I said in the paper, we have introduced an incident management framework.  It is easy to talk about policy at national level but this framework provides a practical way for people to review incidents, get the learning and fix the problem there and then at local level.  Some issues are more systemic but they may only be systemic in a hospital, rather than across a number of hospitals.  All hospital groups and community healthcare organisations now have serious incident management teams and quality and patient safety committees that review that information.  At national level, we also look at that data and where there are significant systemic issues, we may have a national initiative to deal with it or we may hold national learning events to get the message out across the system.<\/p><p> The question of open disclosure has been the subject of discussions here as well.  That is fundamental to a caring healthcare system because it not only provides the person harmed with the information he or she is entitled to and should have immediately, but is a lever for services in itself.  If we tell patients what happened to them, we are also expected to tell them what we are doing to fix it.  I have tried to give a bit more detail. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I will ask a few short questions before the Deputies contribute.  Mr. Lynch might not know this off the top of his head but perhaps he could send us a report on the number of category 1 incidents.  While the numbers involved are small, these are the most catastrophic cases which result in major claims down the road.  Mr. Lynch described the increase in reported incidents as a good thing and a reflection of a more proactive and open approach.  I get that point.  We are interested in the category 1 incidents, so I ask him to send us figures on those.  What mechanisms are in place for immediate action when category 1 incidents occur?<\/p> <p>  Open disclosure is improving and people understand that.  We were told at a previous meeting that when someone lodges a claim and names a consultant or an individual, the State Claims Agency is told to drop the names and substitute them with the HSE corporate.  When we asked whether some people had caused or been involved in several serious incidents, the State Claims Agency's response, which called to mind a fireside chat, was that it had spotted one or two names cropping up a few times and referred such cases to the HSE asking why these individuals' names had popped up a few times.  There did not seem to be any mechanism for dealing with that.  Mr. Lynch has repeatedly mentioned learning but we have not seen learning based on what we have heard so far.  What happens to people who make a mistake or do not know their job?  Are they taken off duty for six months?  Mr Lynch knows what I am getting at.  He gets my question.  That is what we want to hear.<\/p> <p>  I concur with Mr. Lynch on a final point.  Many people end up taking claims, which I blame on HSE management rather than consultants, nurses or doctors.  They may have been part of it but if something goes wrong in a hospital, the hospital manager or senior manager is eventually involved.  It is a major issue.  Group management then comes into it.  There is a policy of not being open at that stage.  The reason many people take cases is that they did not get answers in the first place.  Some of the fault lies in the management structure of the HSE.  Management probably thinks its first objective is to protect the HSE and the patients come second.  Mr. Lynch has admitted to that culture and that people did not get answers when they asked questions.  I am pleased to hear him say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#W00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I deal with and talk to patients, and at my level I tend to meet people who have gone through some of the most difficult experiences in the health service.

As well as the joint senior governance forum between us and the State Claims Agency, we now have a senior clinical risk forum between the clinical indemnity scheme in the State Claims Agency and senior management in the HSE.  We meet quarterly to look primarily at clinical risk.  It is an opportunity for the State Claims Agency to escalate concerns it has raised locally to a national level.  Its risk advisers deal with local hospitals but if it is concerned that issues are not being addressed or are not adequately responded to, there is a forum, quite apart from the interactions we have on a day-to-day basis, at which it can escalate those issues.

I do not like to be parochial about anything but I will use the example of Galway to generalise.  I thank the Chair and the secretariat of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I sought all the external reviews in University Hospital Galway, UHG, over a ten-year period.  The purpose of that was to establish the number carried out, the recommendations, the costs and the changes that could be made.  This responsibility fully falls on Mr. Lynch.  We learned from the language he has used.<\/p> <p>  An extraordinary letter came back.  I have mentioned it loads of times.  It stated that UHG did not have a system to record the number and cost of all external reviews.  That letter was dated 5 November.  On 18 December, it was followed by another, advising following a further search that the hospital did not have an electronic system to record the number and associated cost of all external reviews and investigations.  Finally, on 25 April, the committee found out that a manual search showed there were 13 external reviews concerning the hospital between 2010 and 2018, at a cost of &euro;246,883.  That seems like good value for money.  I will follow up on that.  A figure of 13 external reviews is not a great answer.  It does not show trust. <\/p> <p>  Secondly, I refer to a visit to the hospital.  I have the greatest respect for public nursing and public medicine.  I refer particularly to units five and six of Merlin Park University Hospital.  Again, this concerns management pre-empting and learning from claims.  I refer to a report of a visit by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in December and January.  I will not quote it because my time is limited.  During the inspection, the inspectorate sought written assurance that the water supply was safe for use, but this was not provided.  I remind witnesses that this is a hospital.  The report refers to inadequate signage relating to water.  I will not go into it.  I have the greatest respect for both units.  Like other members, I have made so many representations to get people in there.  I have only mentioned one of the factors that have been highlighted.  There are many more.  It is no reflection on the staff; it is a reflection on management.  It seems to have failed to act. <\/p> <p>  Separate to that is another file I have mentioned many times.  This is a file of letters from consultants who have written to us about the extraordinarily long waiting list.  This is to do with money, not health.  It is to do with the cost to the public purse that eventually arises when people are forced to sue or when people die prematurely and legal actions result.  One correspondent told us that it is intolerable and that it is a regional crisis too big for management to address.  I can hand any of this to the witnesses.  The correspondent describes a catastrophic waiting list of almost 2,000 patients, which has been accumulating since the shortfall in infrastructure.  That is not to mention the pain and suffering caused.  <\/p> <p>  I will stick with that bad word, \"money\".  People end up suffering more, which on top of all their pain and suffering costs the State more in the end, and we end up facing cases.  I refer to risk assessment, acting on risk and identifying the problems on the ground.  Capacity is the first item on the risk register for this hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#Z00900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I cannot answer for the totality of the health service.

The Swiss cheese theory, of things going through the gap, was mentioned.  It opened a whole new regulatory process, which was very exciting for people like me but not very exciting for most people.  That gives rise to greater safety.  What have we learned from the thalidomide issue that will ensure we do not let the same thing happen again?  I acknowledge it arose in a different era.  I am referring, in particular, to the recent legislation introduced by the Minister for Health on access to medicinal cannabis, with the expansion of the compassionate access programme.

I would like the figure for previous years.  There is no need to go into the exact figures, it is just a general question.  Let us presume settlements amounted to &euro;347 million.  What would the SCA have provided for in respect of the cases that were to be settled?  Had the SCA allowed for perhaps &euro;247 million or something closer to &euro;547 million or what was provided for prospective settlements?  How close was the SCA's estimate?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen is telling us what is accumulating.  We are underestimating the costs and that leads me to ask how often does the SCA revalue its cases?  Let us take the example of a case that comes in and all of the legal papers have been served.  It is then adjudged that it is a case worth &euro;1 million.  As the months go by, however, more information may become available.  Is there a systematic method in place which is regularly used to reassess cases when more information is received?  Would a case then be adjusted to state that it might now cost &euro;2 million in light of the new information received?  Does the SCA adjust its overall figures and what is the mechanism for doing that?  I am not looking for information immediately.
