He is joined by Mr. Brian Hill, senior auditor.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering, Farrell and Cassells.<\/p> <p>  We will hold the minutes of the previous meeting over until next week.  Therefore, we will deal next week with anything in the minutes and matters arising.<\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first category is A, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Nos. 2293A and 2297A are from Mr. Conor O'Kelly, CEO, National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  These are his opening statement and briefing documents.  We will note and publish these.  That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2296 A from the HSE, dated 3 July, is a briefing statement for today's meeting on the State Claims Agency.  We will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  The second category is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee and other items for publishing.  We have held over a couple of items from the previous meeting.  The first is No. 2161B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May, enclosing a report on the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities which was undertaken by Mazars.  We published this a couple of weeks ago and there was an indication that some people would like to make some observations.  If anyone wants to make an observation on that, that is fine, and if not, we will circulate it.  If somebody wants to bring it back up the next time under minutes or matters arising, we will do so.  I would like to deal with it formally today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  People can raise the matter again the next day, if they want, before the break.<\/p> <p>  No. 2277B is from Ms Mary Lawlor, communications and public affairs manager, National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, dated 26 June, responding to further information requested by the committee on the payment of &euro;1.9 million to the Revenue Commissioners in 2018.  At our meeting of 13 June we reviewed the 2018 accounts for NAMA and highlighted this payment to the Revenue Commissioners in November 2018 in respect of an underpayment of VAT on certain services received from abroad.  The payment included &euro;600,000 in respect of interests and penalties.  NAMA advised that the liability arose primarily in respect of a NAMA secured asset located abroad where invoices were settled directly with debtors, by debtors or their lawyers.  These invoices were processed externally and were not subject to the normal internal processes for assessing whether a reverse charge VAT obligation arises.  NAMA advised that it has amended its procedures to capture in real time any reverse charge VAT liability due.  We will note and publish this.  NAMA has clarified the matter in full.  I stress that it was a voluntary disclosure by NAMA in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  No. 2284B is from Mr. Maurice Buckley, Chairman, Office of Public Works, dated 27 June, providing an update requested by the committee on the basis of the measurement to determine the rent on Miesian Plaza in Baggot Street, which is the head office for the Department of Health.  A meeting is expected in the coming weeks with the landlord.  We will note and publish this.  We will get an update on that in due course as well.<\/p> <p>  No. 2291B is from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, dated 1 July.  Dr. Lynch is working on providing follow-up information requested at our recent meeting with the Department and has suggested a format for providing information on Pobal.  The letter contains a template for how the Department proposes to provide the information.  Unless any member can suggest an alternative layout in terms of the presentation of the information, I propose that we advise Dr. Lynch to proceed as suggested.  The reason we have done this is because an enormous volume of information was requested at the meeting and we want to make the flow of information in some way manageable, and they want to agree a format with us.  I am happy to proceed with this.  When we get the information, if we want further information again thereafter, we can revisit the matter.  For now we will ask them to provide the information based on the template that they have provided here today.  That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2292B is from Ms Marie Mulvihill, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 28 June, providing information requested at our meeting last week on the health budget oversight group.  We will note and publish this.  The matter arose as a result of recent correspondence that a health budget oversight group had been established, which people might not have been aware of and we might have seen reference to it.  We think it is a good thing and follows on from a previous recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts in our last periodic report where we stated that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should engage directly with those Departments that have a history of a substantial requirement for Supplementary Estimates.  The Department is acting on that but perhaps it was going to do so in any event.  It has set up the membership of the health budget oversight committee.  Officials confirmed here at the previous meeting that the group is only dealing with current expenditure and does not include capital expenditure.  We would suggest that the group would also cover that.  In the meantime, it is good that there is an oversight group to work on this issue.  I will list the membership of the committee so that people will know its make-up: Mr. Ronnie Downes is the chairperson, and he is an assistant secretary in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; Mr. Colin Menton is an assistant secretary in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; Mr. Colm O'Riordan is a deputy secretary in the Department of Health; Mr. Colm Desmond is an assistant secretary in the Department of Health; Mr. Stephen Mulvany is the chief financial officer of the HSE; Mr. Liam Woods is the national director and chief operations officer in the HSE; and Ms Rosarii Mannion is the national director of human resources in the HSE.  The secretariat is provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am delighted to see that there is such a group in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Except for gender, the list is perfectly right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I noticed the gender balance as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The committee is 100% male.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Nearly, except for Ms Rosarii Mannion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Yes.

We will pass our observation on to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, as he is the man in charge.  I thank the Deputies for the observation.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 2294B from the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 2 July, providing a notice on the sentence calculation review carried out on behalf of the Irish Prison Service.  We will note and publish this item.  It will be included in our periodic report that we will publish next week.<\/p><p>A detailed review of that particular issue has been conducted, and we were satisfied to receive that.<br\/><br\/>No. 2295B is from William Beausang, Department of Education and Skills.  He has provided an update on responses received by the Department from Waterford IT arising from matters related to the spin-out company FeedHenry.  We will note and publish this item and it will feed into our periodic report.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <br\/><br\/>Category C relates to private individuals and other correspondence.  One item has been held over from previous meetings and I want to do a detailed note on that because we have a number of letters on this issue from this particular correspondent.  It is their right to correspond with this committee.  No. 2260C, dated 18 June, is further correspondence from an individual about the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  We considered correspondence from this individual at our meeting on 13 June 2019.  The matters raised appeared to involve a breach of legislation and it was agreed to advise the individual that the matters raised were not within the remit of the committee, but were a policy or legislation issue.  In this item, the correspondent states that he intends to make a further submission to the committee.  We have previously written to both the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners on matters raised by the correspondent regarding bogus self-employment.  We sent responses to the correspondent, which were received, in June 2018.  The Department advised in 2018 that it had published a review of trends in, and issues arising from, the use of intermediary structures and self-employment arrangements, together with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners<font color=\"#808080\">.  <\/font>The report considered the available data on employment trends, including data used in the correspondent's submission, and concluded that there was little, if any, evidence that there has been an increase in the level of what is termed &quot;disguised or false self-employment&quot;.  The report made a number of recommendations.  One recommendation was to increase public awareness of the services provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's scope section, and a public awareness campaign about false self-employment was launched in May of last year.<br\/><br\/>I propose we inform the correspondent that our consideration of the matter is closed, in light of the fact that various State organisations have dealt with the information.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2279C is from Mr. John Conway, assistant secretary of Louth Environmental Group.  It is dated 27 June 2019, and is a response to correspondence we sent to the group which was received from the Office of Public Works, OPW, following inquiries made by the committee regarding a flood risk project at Bellurgan, Dundalk, County Louth.  I propose to advise the group to make contact with the Local Government Audit Service as the work was carried by Louth County Council, but members may also wish to take this matter up with the OPW when it is next before the committee giving its financial statements.We will note this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2280C is a response from an individual to our recent correspondence to him regarding salaries and allowances for Oireachtas Members.  We will note this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2281C, dated 24 June 2019, is from an individual responding to our recent correspondence to him and to our discussion of his correspondence in respect of Kerry County Council.  The correspondent says we misunderstood the point he was making, which was about the value for money of discretionary funds that are made available to councillors.  Nonetheless, our position remains that the matters raised are not within the remit of the committee and I propose to reiterate that he should make his inquiry to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>No. 2283C, dated 27 June 2019, is from Mr. Allen Morgan, enclosing further correspondence following our private meeting on 20 June 2019.  Mr. Morgan is a retired senior official from the OPW with extensive experience, having worked in the organisation for years.  We met him in private session to discuss a number of projects he wanted to highlight.  In response to queries from members, Mr. Morgan has provided further documentation and, in summary, he recommends that the lessons learned from the Miesian Plaza case should be embedded in all OPW projects.  On the transfer of the property remit from the OPW to a dedicated agency-type organisation, he cites the example of Coillte and other European comparator countries where there is a more commercially focused agency approach.  He also recommends greater and more clearly independent oversight or scrutiny of property cases, especially while these remain within OPW&rsquo;s remit.  Members will agree that there is merit in exploring these recommendations further.  However, it is not within the remit of the committee to do so, because almost everything Mr. Morgan refers to is a policy matter for the relevant Minister.  I propose that we forward this correspondence, with his permission, to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, as it deals with the OPW, and it is under that committee's remit to consider policy matters.  We will ask for its consideration and any action it deems appropriate.  Members may also wish to raise the matter in other fora.  Is that agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#B01400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>What committee are we sending it to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#C00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, as that committee deals with the OPW.

At our meeting on 13 June, we decided to forward a number of items of correspondence in respect of this company to the OPW for a response.  The secretariat routinely requests the correspondent's permission and, in this instance, the company has declined to provide consent for this purpose.  The matter relates to specifications for cell windows in Garda stations and courthouses.  The correspondent believes the winning tenders are not meeting the health and safety specifications set out in the tender documents.  I propose to write to both the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ask if they are completely satisfied that the health and safety standards and specifications for the supply and fitting of cell windows are being met.  I propose that we also ask the OPW to describe the controls in place to ensure the winning tenders deliver the specification set out in tender documents.  In conversation with one of the correspondents, the clerk to the committee was given to understand that the matter has also been referred to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  I propose we write to the HSA for an update on the matter.  The company does not want us to send its correspondence on directly, but to raise the general issue of tendering so that what is in the tender document is subsequently delivered, and that the mechanisms to do that are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#C01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We should also draw the State Claims Agency's attention to it, because there is a risk assessment aspect to its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#C01400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Representatives from the agency will be before the committee later, so we might raise it with them then.

However, it has recognised &euro;3.75 million more than is warranted for a funding agreement it entered with the Higher Education Authority.  Otherwise, the financial statements give a true and fair view.  On a separate point, it is noted that the university had non-compliant procurement to the value of &euro;2.9 million in 2016 and 2017.  It is unusual for the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualify an audit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#D01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>It is and we do not do it lightly.

These are the type of issues that will arise.<\/p><p>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>As members are aware, the National Treasury Management Agency is a complex organisation with multiple functions that extend beyond its original and core role of managing Ireland&rsquo;s national debt.  The set of financial statements before the committee this morning reflects the various statutory obligations of the agency in respect of its financial reporting.  The NTMA&rsquo;s primary function is to manage borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the national debt account.  At the end of 2018, the gross national debt stood at slightly more than &euro;205 billion.  This was an increase of more than &euro;6.5 billion on the gross national debt at the end of 2017.  Total debt servicing costs in 2018 amounted to &euro;6 billion.  This was 4% less than in the previous year, reflecting the impact of refinancing of debt at prevailing low interest rates.<\/p> <p>  Other key functions and services of the NTMA that are accounted for separately include management of compensation claims on behalf of certain State authorities in its capacity as the State Claims Agency, management of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and provision of procurement and financial advice in respect of certain public private partnerships and other large capital projects in its capacity as the National Development Finance Agency.  <\/p> <p>  The financial statements of the State Claims Agency indicate claims settlements on behalf of State agencies in 2018 amounting to slightly more than &euro;250 million, with associated expenses of &euro;104 million.  This expenditure, totalling &euro;354 million, was recovered from the State agencies involved and represented an increase of almost 12% on the 2017 level.  The agency&rsquo;s estimate of the value of claims liabilities outstanding at end 2018 was &euro;3.15 billion, up 18% from the estimate of &euro;2.66 billion at the end of 2017.  As members are aware, almost three quarters of the estimated claims value outstanding relates to clinical claims.  <\/p> <p>  The financial statements of the ISIF show a reduction of &euro;3.6 billion in the value of the fund assets between the end of 2017 and the end of 2018.  The loss in value that occurred in 2018 is related to a significant fall in the value of the fund&rsquo;s shareholdings in AIB and Bank of Ireland, which comprise a portfolio invested in by the fund at the direction of the Minister for Finance.  The audit report on the ISIF financial statements draws attention to the NTMA statement on internal control, which discloses a weakness in controls relating to foreign currency hedging that resulted in a loss of &euro;721,000 in the year.  The agency has since introduced enhanced controls in that area.  <\/p> <p>  The NTMA assigns staff and provides certain other support services, on a reimbursement basis, to certain independent bodies, including the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and, since 2018, Home Building Finance Ireland.  These are governed by separate boards and the NTMA is not accountable for their activities.  The NTMA also provides staff on secondment for the Department of Finance&rsquo;s banking unit, with the costs in that case being carried by the NTMA.  <\/p> <p>  The NTMA&rsquo;s administration account shows gross expenditure on administration costs totalled &euro;127.2 million in 2018.  Of this total, &euro;46.7 million or 37% was recovered from NAMA and the SBCI.  Overall, staff costs accounted for around 79% of the expenditure in the year.  All staff are employees of the NTMA, including those assigned to work for the supported agencies.  As explained in note 7.3 of the administration account, the agency operated a voluntary redundancy scheme during 2018 at a cost of &euro;2.6 million.  This is separate from the voluntary redundancy and retention scheme operated for NAMA staff, which cost a further &euro;1.8 million.<\/p> <p>  The audit report on the NTMA administration account draws attention to expenditure of &euro;5.9 million in 2018 relating to contracts that were not publicly advertised.  The NTMA&rsquo;s statement on internal control provides explanations for the procurement approach adopted in relation to those contracts.<\/p> <p>  Pursuant to section 28 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000, the Minister for Finance delegated to the NTMA a range of functions in respect of the Ireland Apple escrow fund, including the production of annual financial statements, which are subject to audit by me.  The first set of financial statements for the fund were prepared for the period 17 May 2018 to 31 December 2018.  These are published separately from the other NTMA accounts.  Between May and September 2018, Apple paid amounts totalling &euro;14.285 billion into the escrow fund.  The net assets of the fund at year end were &euro;14.269 billion, representing a decline in value of &euro;16 million.  Operating expenses of &euro;2 million were incurred during 2018 in respect of investment management and other fees and expenses.  The remainder of the loss in value in the period of account is attributed to the current negative interest rate environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and call Mr. O'Kelly to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and committee for the opportunity to present before it.<\/p><p>The committee has received my opening statement, which I do not intend to read.  We have also provided some slides which I will use only for the discussion of the national debt, if that is all right.  It would probably be easier to go through that with the slides in front of us.  I will give a quick overview of some of the businesses in Vote 2018, our outlook for the markets and what is informing our views of strategy and decision-making at the current time.  I thank the board of the NTMA and, in particular, our former chairman, Willie Walsh, who stepped down at the end of 2018 having been there since the beginning of 2015 on the newly constructed board.  I thank him for his contribution.  We have seven excellent non-executives and a new chairman, Maeve Carton, former chief financial officer of CRH.  We are very fortunate to have this quality of non-executives, who give us plenty of support and challenge.  I also acknowledge the Committee of Public Accounts and the challenge it has given us, particularly in the areas of diversity, tobacco and fossil fuels.  It is fair to say the committee has kept those issues high on our agenda over the last few years.  We have made some progress there and we still have plenty to do.  I wanted at the outset to acknowledge the contribution and challenge of the committee in that regard.<\/p><p> I will start with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  The key fact is that for 2018, the ISIF lost 1% in value.  Members will be aware that 2018 was one of the worst years for stock markets since the early 1920s.  The S&amp;P 500, the US index, was down 6% and the Irish stock market was down 22%.  Virtually all asset classes lost money and were in negative territory in that year.  The ISIF exposure to global equities meant that overall it lost 1% of its value.  I am glad to say that markets have recovered very significantly in 2019 and all of that loss - and then some - has been recovered.  In total, since the ISIF was first instituted, a total of &euro;850 million in investment gains have been added to the value of the portfolio.  That is a return of 2.3% annually on the money, which is invested across Ireland with some exposure to global markets, as that cash remains to be invested in the mandate.  A 2.3% return when we are borrowing money at an average of less than 1% is pretty good business for the State to date.<\/p><p> One of the other key features of the ISIF is that we always co-invest in any of the investments we make.  The &euro;4.4 billion we have committed to the Irish market since inception has been matched by &euro;8.1 billion in private investment.  That means a total of &euro;12.5 billion has been invested in the Irish economy right across all the different sectors and regions.  I do not want to outline all the investments we made this year; they are listed in the annual report.  Investments were made at a rate of about one every two weeks in total, with over &euro;700 million deployed in the year.  I will come back to the rate of deployment a little bit later on.  Investments included MilkFlex, a fund which provides financing to dairy farmers, Shannon Airport, the Port of Cork, Green Isle Foods, Donegal Catch and Vectra, a company which uses artificial intelligence to provide cybersecurity and which has set up a Dublin office.  Vectra has already employed more than 40 people following our investment.  We invested across the alternative energy space in 2018, backing a fund called Temporis Capital, which is set to commit and develop alternative energy, as much as 1,000 MW, which is almost 25% of Ireland's total requirement in that space.  We have also backed a solar energy company in the last 12 months.  Another feature of the ISIF to which I referred springs from legislation enacted by the Oireachtas in respect of fossil fuels.  The ISIF has divested of the 38 holdings it had in fossil fuel stocks and additionally has produced an exclusion list of 148 stocks in which it is precluded from investing under the Act.<\/p><p> The fund has had a review and tries to be adaptable to economic conditions.  It was set up in 2015, when the economy was in a different position and there was more of a shortage of the kind of capital that we have.  We have been adapting over those years and always look to be flexible in terms of moving with the times.  We are not there to replace other capital that is available; we have to go where capital does not flow as easily as that is the purpose of the fund.  That is what we call the dead weight test.  If other capital is available, we will not invest.  As the economy has recovered and there is a lot of capital available, we have found ourselves more in the space of tenure, meaning the term of the investment we are prepared to make.  There is lots of private equity and investment capital for a term of five or seven years, but going out to ten, 12 or 15 years there is very little capital available.  We find ourselves now engaged in projects that have a much longer-term horizon and focus.  That is probably where the committee is going to see more of our activities over the coming year to 24 months.  I also suspect we will deploy less capital than we did in the initial four years of the fund, when we deployed between &euro;700 million and &euro;800 million per annum.  The size of the projects is beginning to decline.  Many of the projects that were pent up from the crisis have come into our portfolio.  As we normalise and as other capital is becoming available, I see the deployment rate declining somewhat.  This is a good thing.  If there is other capital available, that is good news and probably reflects where we are in the cycle.  We do not have to spend the money.  We are not anxious to spend it.  We only want to invest the money if it is good value for the State and makes that economic impact.  If the money is not invested, it is still an asset of the State and sits on the balance sheet as an asset.<\/p><p> There has been excess surplus in the fund, which stands at &euro;9.4 billion now.  There is &euro;4.4 billion in Irish investments, which leaves us with &euro;5.1 billion.  As the committee is aware, &euro;3.5 billion of that has been reallocated by the current Government, with &euro;1.5 billion going into the rainy day fund, &euro;750 million allocated to Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, and &euro;1.25 billion to the Land Development Agency, LDA.  That sum has been taken away, as it were, as excess reserve to be used elsewhere by the State, reducing the overall size of the ISIF.  The &euro;4.4 billion will already start to recycle because some of the investments are already yielding returns in the shape of dividends and even capital to the fund.  The idea is that it becomes an evergreen fund and funds itself to be able to grow and invest long into the future.  That is the ambition.<\/p><p> The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, provides advice in respect of most big projects and particularly public-private partnerships, PPPs.  We have had a lot of discussion of PPPs at this committee over the years.  We had probably the most significant year of real challenge and stress in respect of the collapse of Carillion in the UK, one of the biggest liquidations of a project management construction firm in that country's history.  It has had a devastating effect across many projects in the UK.  Carillion was only involved in one project in Ireland, which we call \"schools bundle 5\".  That was the building of six schools in Wicklow, Wexford and Meath.  It was an interesting test of the PPP model.  One of the discussions around PPPs is whether the risk transfers to the private sector; does the private sector really take the risk or, when something happens, does the State ends up picking up the tab.  In this case, four of the schools are already open although they were a year delayed.  The rest of the schools will open this September but there will be no additional cost to the taxpayer.  That PPP contract has completely stood up and remained intact.  From the taxpayer point of view, no additional cost has been incurred.  The equity providers and financiers of that PPP contract have lost all their equity money and have had to take a lower return.  That is the purpose of that contract when we transfer risk, and there is a cost associated with it.  The idea is that in theory, when a stress event occurs, they do own the risk.  It is an interesting real-life example where the PPP contract stood up.  At a time when we have many projects to construct, it is worth reflecting on the robustness of that contract in that particular live situation.<\/p><p> I will touch on NewERA, which is in many ways the in-house corporate finance adviser to the State.  It has advised on 132 different projects, acquisitions or disposals of commercial semi-State companies.  NewERA tries to bring together all of the assets owned by the State under one umbrella in the context of the shareholder so that the State has consistent analysis of investment criteria, return on capital and dividend policy.  NewERA brings them all to account in a similar and consistent fashion.  The mandate that the team is being asked to deliver advice on continues to grow.  There were 132 advisory projects done on behalf of the State for different Departments and clients this year.  That figure is up from 81 in 2017.<\/p><p> Representatives from the State Claims Agency are with us and I know we have a separate session on that work but I will touch on it.  There are 146 State bodies with more than 200,000 employees.  Considerable footfall goes through there.  Earlier, the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that the vast majority of the 1,500 claims are clinical in value terms.  The provision is &euro;3.15 billion.  This is the current estimated liability and 74% of that is provided for the clinical sector.<\/p><p> We deal with and have dealt with many sad and difficult cases in the State Claims Agency.  That is the nature of the mandate.  However, we have never before had a situation like we have had in 2018.  I know we are going to discuss extensive technicalities and legal positions today but it has to be seen in the light of the extraordinary devastation and grief caused to so many women by this situation.  There are no good outcomes.  We and the team try to walk that line as sensitively as we can but it is not an easy task.  It all pales in comparison to the grief and devastation caused to the women involved in the overall issue.<\/p><p> Apple has been mentioned.  The first financial results for the Apple fund were announced yesterday and released by the Department of Finance.  As committee members are aware, the National Treasury Management Agency was directed by the Minister to establish the escrow fund to essentially look after those funds while the legal case is going on.  Apple and the NTMA jointly have an investment policy.  A sum of &euro;14.2 billion sits now in an investment account of which the NTMA and Apple have oversight.  The easiest way to describe it is as a conservative cash box of sorts.  The purpose of the fund is a return of capital rather than a return on capital.  That is the focus of the fund.  It is about capital preservation.  The fund has been established and it is currently operating satisfactorily.<\/p><p> I will turn to the slides to discuss the debt.  It might be easier to talk through from slide 16.  The slides cover the positives and negatives or challenges.  I will touch on each of these in turn.  On the left hand side of the slide we are looking at the positives of the national debt and the servicing of the debt.  Committee members can see the so-called chimneys or refinancing stacks of 2018, 2019 and 2020.  We have talked about these at the committee during previous years.  It is fair to say at this point, when we are exactly half-way through the refinancing period, that we can safely put the refinancing risk that has existed behind us because of what has happened.  I will come to that in more detail in a moment.  The debt has been smoothed out in terms of the future profile of maturities.  There are no such refinancing cliffs ahead in the foreseeable future.  That is important from a debt management point of view; it is important to have a smooth profile.<\/p><p> The interest bill continues to fall.  I will come back to that again.  The interest bill has fallen from &euro;7.5 billion in 2014 to a projected &euro;4.5 billion next year.  I will come back to the reasons that saving has been so dramatic.  It is largely due to the interest rate environment we are in.<\/p><p> I want to touch on diversification.  Ireland issued its first green bond in 2018, becoming only the fourth European sovereign country to do so.  I will come back to the rationale behind that as well.<\/p><p> The debt is still elevated though.  That is still a significant issue.  It is four times what it was in the 2000s before the financial crisis.  We have paid a very significant amount of interest.  People may have heard me say that we have paid &euro;33 billion in interest over the past five years.  This interest bill is enormous.  We paid &euro;60 billion in interest over the last decade.  That compares to &euro;20 billion in the previous decade.  That is all to do with the elevated amount of debt rather than the rate of interest, which many people concentrate on.  Some may suggest that since rates are so low we should borrow more etc.  We have to remember that it is the stock of debt that is really significant in this regard for Ireland.<\/p><p> We rely on foreign capital for the largest portion, 90%, of our borrowings.  That is unusual versus other European and global sovereigns.  It makes us slightly more vulnerable than others to financial markets.  Of course there are significant external risks on the horizons of which committee members are well aware.<\/p><p> Before 2018 we talked about the refinancing chimneys to the tune of &euro;60 billion.  In the first instance we repaid the International Monetary Fund and that reduced the size of the chimneys.  Since then, we have repaid the 2018 bond that matured.  That was a &euro;9 billion bond and it matured in October 2018.  We have also repaid the &euro;7 billion bond in June, some weeks ago.  There is another maturity of &euro;6 billion in October.  There is a &euro;10 billion maturity coming early next year.  Then there is a final maturity of &euro;6 billion in October 2020.  That will remove the chimneys completely.  However, given the cash we have already raised and the repayments we have already made of those maturities, we can say now for the first time that the refinancing risks of those chimneys is now behind us.  This is because of what we have already repaid and the cash we have already raised at today's market rates.  The key thing about the coupons that we have been repaying is that a total of five large bonds fell due over a short period.  The range of coupons was from 4.4% to 5.9%.  They are the really high coupons and they are all retiring.  We are replacing them with debt that is 1% and under.  That is where the big savings come from.  That is why the savings really start to fall post 2020.  It is why this refinancing period was so important for us.  It was important for us to be able to try to lock in today's interest rate environment while we had that significant need.  We can now put that risk safety behind us.<\/p><p> Let us consider the profile now.  The debt manager normally looks three or four years ahead.  We were looking at 2018, 2019 and 2020 in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  Now we are looking ahead to 2022, 2023 and 2024.  Committee members will see the smoother profile of maturities.  That represents a far lower risk profile from the point of view of the State in terms of maturing debt over the long period and looking out to the future.<\/p><p> Earlier I said the interest bill was &euro;7.5 billion and is down to &euro;4.5 billion.  There are three reasons this has occurred.  First, and most important, is the interest rate environment created by the European Central Bank quantitative easing and the extraordinary low interest rate environment.  Committee members do not necessarily watch financial markets in the same way that we do, but since Christine Lagarde's potential appointment as the ECB President, interest rates have fallen dramatically during the past 48 hours and there has been a dramatic move lower in bond market yields.  She is considered to be a dovish ECB President potentially versus some of the alternatives.  The market has reacted and moved rates even lower.  The interest rate environment looks like it will remain low at least for the foreseeable future.  This extraordinary low interest rate environment happened at a time when Ireland had its greatest refinancing needs and at a time when the credit rating of the country was improving.  These three things came together and this environment has enabled Ireland to save so much interest.<\/p><p>Those high coupons all fall away and get replaced by lower ones.  That is why the savings are so significant.  I will revert to why that will not always be the case in a moment.<\/p><p> Some of the Deputies are interested in the topic of the green bond.  While it is good news from the point of view of leadership and ensuring that sustainable projects get delivered and identified, the NTMA has a slightly narrow way of looking at it.  This is the fastest growing pool of capital in the world.  We are accessing new investors by issuing green bonds.  From a funding perspective, that helps to diversify the risk.  One of the few ways we can diversify and mitigate our risk is to widen the investor base that owns Irish bonds.  When we issued our first green bond, more than 50% of the investors who bought it and loaned us money had never invested in Ireland before.  Besides the ability to finance sustainable projects, that was the attraction for us.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the other side of the balance sheet with the negatives and challenges.  This is our gross debt, which has effectively remained unchanged since the crisis.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, it stands at &euro;205 billion currently.  Let us just call it over &euro;200 billion.  It is four times what it was in the 2000s.  I describe this as a mountain of debt, and there is only one way to get down a mountain, that being, very slowly and carefully and without taking alternative routes or going back up the mountain.  We must try to find a way to reduce this debt over time.  That will only happen slowly, but we must stick to the path and do that.  The risks to the country of having very high debt levels are the risks that any of us would have as individuals, householders or businesses in the event of a downturn, in that we would obviously be more vulnerable.  It is no different for a sovereign.<\/p><p> Regarding debt, by comparison with our European peers and other countries, we rate poorly in some of these statistics.  The European average is shown at the bottom of the table.  I draw members' attention to our debt-to-Government revenue figure, which is still at 251% and one of the highest in Europe.  Although our interest bill has reduced as a percentage of Government revenue to 6%, it is still way higher than our European peers.  Even at today's interests and with the savings we have made, that is where it still ranks among our European peers.  Ireland is not in a good position from a debt point of view.  We must continue to bear that in mind and be vigilant.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the interest bill dating back to the mid-2000s.  I showed how it was falling from &euro;7.5 billion to &euro;4.5 billion, but that will still be three times what it was in the 2003-08 period.  Even though interest rates then were 4% and are less than 1% today, our current interest bill is three times what it was in that period because of the size of our debt.<\/p><p> I will show how challenging that will be in future.  Consider the bonds that are now going to mature.  I mentioned bonds maturing with high coupon rates.  One of the bonds that will mature in 2022 was issued by us in 2017 and has a 0% coupon.  The chances of the NTMA refinancing that bond in 2022 at a lower interest rate are slim.  That is why we will be refinancing through low-coupon bonds and unlikely to make savings in future.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the investors from whom we borrowed this sizeable amount of debt.  They are all overseas, which is unusual.  There is not a large domestic savings market for our bonds.  This makes us particularly vulnerable.  These investors can change their minds quickly, move away and charge us more.  Our reputation, creditworthiness and positioning in the marketplace are important.  Obviously, we are quite exposed.<\/p><p> I will not necessarily go into the challenges ahead that are listed on the next slide in any detail, although we can take some questions.  Our investors are telling us that they are worried about Brexit and corporation tax changes.  The financial markets are concerned and are looking at Italy and some of the challenges it faces from a debt perspective.  The spreads in Italy are volatile at the moment.<\/p><p> That concludes my presentation.  I am happy to take members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Kelly.

We have 10,658 outstanding claims that we are managing at a potential cost of &euro;3.15 billion.  Clinical claims amount to 3,196, which is a &euro;2.33 billion estimated liability.  That is 30% by volume terms, in terms of the number of claims, and yet representing 74% of the potential cost.  On the general side, we have 7,462 claims that are active at a cost of &euro;820 million.  They are the employers and public liability and property damage claims against the State.<\/p> <p>  Our total transactional expenditure is the amount of money that we spend in a particular calendar year across both schemes, that is, the clinical indemnity scheme and the general indemnity scheme.  In 2017, that was &euro;303 million and in 2018, it went up to &euro;347 million.  One reason that has climbed in the way it has is due to things like claims inflation and the factoring in of the Gill Russell case, which is the case dealing with the discount rate and the calculation of special damages.  In addition, we are setting and resolving more claims as well.<\/p> <p>  Our clinical claims resolved in the year 2018 came to approximately &euro;247 million, compared with &euro;134 million in the previous year.  If I could explain the &euro;92 million gap, about which members might wonder, we have set it out in our annual report that it is due to the Gill Russell uplifts.  These were cases that we had settled on the basis of the higher discount rate and when the Court of Appeal gave its judgment, we had to pay at the lower rate.  Consequently, there were differences to be paid on some claims that we had settled and that amounted to &euro;65 million.  The awards over &euro;1 million jumped from 20 in 2017 to 56 in 2018 and then we had other awards and settlements; we just simply had at a higher number, up from 42 to 59.  That is probably the overall pen picture of the statistics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Please explain the discount rate.

The Gill Russell case, which we handled, was a catastrophic injury case to an infant in which the rate was reduced based on economic advice that was available to the court at the time.

This debate is a continuation of a topic that we discussed here last year.  We did not to complete it because there was so much information being sought from the HSE on the number and category of claims.  We sought information for the public watching by hospital in an effort to see whether hospitals had a higher risk.  There was an assessment from the agency that were such a league to be published, then it could potentially be misleading or unfairly damaging to some hospitals just because of the number of people presenting.  We agreed to not go into that detail because it could have other knock-on consequences.  We then mentioned hospital groups as an issue.  When the agency was here on the last day, we had quite a bit of information to receive on an ongoing basis thereafter and we said we would come back to it again this year.  We are really only in a follow-through mode, somewhere along the line, from the HSE.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for our colleagues in the Department  of Health and the HSE, more so than the State Claims Agency.  What is being done to reduce the amount of medical negligence cases in the health service?  We are here having this meeting not because the State Claims Agency has a cost of &euro;3 billion but because of medical negligence in hospitals and other HSE footings.  Really the question should start and begin with the Department and the HSE because that is the source of where all of the issues have happened.  We have talked about this over the past year and we have been given a report today for today's meeting.  Can somebody talk to me from the HSE's perspective on the proactive measures that have been taken?  We heard here the last time that an incident can happen in a hospital, a report is compiled locally, which is not a ministerial one, but there is no proper mechanism to share the lessons and so on beyond that hospital in some cases.  Sometimes it might have been the group.  Sometimes, if a more serious event is being examined, the results might be circulated to all of the hospital managers but nobody seems to know whether they even have time to look at these things when they do get them.  The number of claims increases every year.  Our question is, in the first instance, more directed at the health service rather than the State Claims Agency.  We will just take an observation from the witnesses at this stage and we will then move on to the substance of the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>By the time it becomes a claim, it is at the very end of a process so it may be a number of years on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>On what we tried to illustrate in the report, we know already there are big areas of risk in terms of harm that happens in the health service.

In the report, I tried to set out for members some of the big areas of harm we know that have happened.  Really then, we should be way ahead of it in terms of prevention.  I then have a particular interest in when incidents happen.  We know that a lot of people go the legal route for a number of reasons.  One is, in particular, that they do not feel they have got the answers to what went wrong.  I have met a number of patients who have been harmed.

They told me that one of the reasons they went to court was that they did not get the information and were not told what had happened.  They had very simple questions, namely, what happened, why did it happen and what had been done to fix it.  They wanted to know that it was not going to happen to anyone else.<\/p><p> We work closely with the State Claims Agency, not only when it comes to claims but also in incident reporting.  The national incident management system was established by the State Claims Agency but is owned by the public service.  In the four years since its establishment, we have seen a 33% increase in the number of incidents reported.  That is a good thing, although it may seem counter-intuitive, because any health system with a healthy patient safety culture will report incidents.  That includes incidents where no harm has been caused at all, which may be negligible or which may have had no impact on the person involved.  Good incident reporting leads to good learning at the outset.  Any health system in the world encourages reporting because assuming that increased numbers are an indication of poorer safety takes from the culture of patient safety in hospitals, institutions or community services.  That has been a big success.  While the State Claims Agency can answer for itself, I think it would point to that as being very significant.  It allows us to see the trends in incidents, whether at a local level in a hospital, community service or hospital group, or at national level.  That is just one part of it.<\/p><p> Only 1% of the incidents reported are considered major or extreme.  These are incidents that result in serious harm to people and, in some cases, people die as a result.  We do not want to wait until a claim is lodged to get people to start looking at why it happened.  With category 1 incidents, where that level of harm has occurred, there is a requirement to review them and understand what happened, not after two or three months but immediately.  If another person coming in to that facility today will face a risk, that risk has to be sorted and the factors that led to the incident have to be identified.  As I said in the paper, we have introduced an incident management framework.  It is easy to talk about policy at national level but this framework provides a practical way for people to review incidents, get the learning and fix the problem there and then at local level.  Some issues are more systemic but they may only be systemic in a hospital, rather than across a number of hospitals.  All hospital groups and community healthcare organisations now have serious incident management teams and quality and patient safety committees that review that information.  At national level, we also look at that data and where there are significant systemic issues, we may have a national initiative to deal with it or we may hold national learning events to get the message out across the system.<\/p><p> The question of open disclosure has been the subject of discussions here as well.  That is fundamental to a caring healthcare system because it not only provides the person harmed with the information he or she is entitled to and should have immediately, but is a lever for services in itself.  If we tell patients what happened to them, we are also expected to tell them what we are doing to fix it.  I have tried to give a bit more detail. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#V02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562227200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I will ask a few short questions before the Deputies contribute.  Mr. Lynch might not know this off the top of his head but perhaps he could send us a report on the number of category 1 incidents.  While the numbers involved are small, these are the most catastrophic cases which result in major claims down the road.  Mr. Lynch described the increase in reported incidents as a good thing and a reflection of a more proactive and open approach.  I get that point.  We are interested in the category 1 incidents, so I ask him to send us figures on those.  What mechanisms are in place for immediate action when category 1 incidents occur?<\/p> <p>  Open disclosure is improving and people understand that.  We were told at a previous meeting that when someone lodges a claim and names a consultant or an individual, the State Claims Agency is told to drop the names and substitute them with the HSE corporate.  When we asked whether some people had caused or been involved in several serious incidents, the State Claims Agency's response, which called to mind a fireside chat, was that it had spotted one or two names cropping up a few times and referred such cases to the HSE asking why these individuals' names had popped up a few times.  There did not seem to be any mechanism for dealing with that.  Mr. Lynch has repeatedly mentioned learning but we have not seen learning based on what we have heard so far.  What happens to people who make a mistake or do not know their job?  Are they taken off duty for six months?  Mr Lynch knows what I am getting at.  He gets my question.  That is what we want to hear.<\/p> <p>  I concur with Mr. Lynch on a final point.  Many people end up taking claims, which I blame on HSE management rather than consultants, nurses or doctors.  They may have been part of it but if something goes wrong in a hospital, the hospital manager or senior manager is eventually involved.  It is a major issue.  Group management then comes into it.  There is a policy of not being open at that stage.  The reason many people take cases is that they did not get answers in the first place.  Some of the fault lies in the management structure of the HSE.  Management probably thinks its first objective is to protect the HSE and the patients come second.  Mr. Lynch has admitted to that culture and that people did not get answers when they asked questions.  I am pleased to hear him say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#W00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I deal with and talk to patients, and at my level I tend to meet people who have gone through some of the most difficult experiences in the health service.

As well as the joint senior governance forum between us and the State Claims Agency, we now have a senior clinical risk forum between the clinical indemnity scheme in the State Claims Agency and senior management in the HSE.  We meet quarterly to look primarily at clinical risk.  It is an opportunity for the State Claims Agency to escalate concerns it has raised locally to a national level.  Its risk advisers deal with local hospitals but if it is concerned that issues are not being addressed or are not adequately responded to, there is a forum, quite apart from the interactions we have on a day-to-day basis, at which it can escalate those issues.

I do not like to be parochial about anything but I will use the example of Galway to generalise.  I thank the Chair and the secretariat of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I sought all the external reviews in University Hospital Galway, UHG, over a ten-year period.  The purpose of that was to establish the number carried out, the recommendations, the costs and the changes that could be made.  This responsibility fully falls on Mr. Lynch.  We learned from the language he has used.<\/p> <p>  An extraordinary letter came back.  I have mentioned it loads of times.  It stated that UHG did not have a system to record the number and cost of all external reviews.  That letter was dated 5 November.  On 18 December, it was followed by another, advising following a further search that the hospital did not have an electronic system to record the number and associated cost of all external reviews and investigations.  Finally, on 25 April, the committee found out that a manual search showed there were 13 external reviews concerning the hospital between 2010 and 2018, at a cost of &euro;246,883.  That seems like good value for money.  I will follow up on that.  A figure of 13 external reviews is not a great answer.  It does not show trust. <\/p> <p>  Secondly, I refer to a visit to the hospital.  I have the greatest respect for public nursing and public medicine.  I refer particularly to units five and six of Merlin Park University Hospital.  Again, this concerns management pre-empting and learning from claims.  I refer to a report of a visit by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in December and January.  I will not quote it because my time is limited.  During the inspection, the inspectorate sought written assurance that the water supply was safe for use, but this was not provided.  I remind witnesses that this is a hospital.  The report refers to inadequate signage relating to water.  I will not go into it.  I have the greatest respect for both units.  Like other members, I have made so many representations to get people in there.  I have only mentioned one of the factors that have been highlighted.  There are many more.  It is no reflection on the staff; it is a reflection on management.  It seems to have failed to act. <\/p> <p>  Separate to that is another file I have mentioned many times.  This is a file of letters from consultants who have written to us about the extraordinarily long waiting list.  This is to do with money, not health.  It is to do with the cost to the public purse that eventually arises when people are forced to sue or when people die prematurely and legal actions result.  One correspondent told us that it is intolerable and that it is a regional crisis too big for management to address.  I can hand any of this to the witnesses.  The correspondent describes a catastrophic waiting list of almost 2,000 patients, which has been accumulating since the shortfall in infrastructure.  That is not to mention the pain and suffering caused.  <\/p> <p>  I will stick with that bad word, \"money\".  People end up suffering more, which on top of all their pain and suffering costs the State more in the end, and we end up facing cases.  I refer to risk assessment, acting on risk and identifying the problems on the ground.  Capacity is the first item on the risk register for this hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019070400002#Z00900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562227200,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I cannot answer for the totality of the health service.

The Swiss cheese theory, of things going through the gap, was mentioned.  It opened a whole new regulatory process, which was very exciting for people like me but not very exciting for most people.  That gives rise to greater safety.  What have we learned from the thalidomide issue that will ensure we do not let the same thing happen again?  I acknowledge it arose in a different era.  I am referring, in particular, to the recent legislation introduced by the Minister for Health on access to medicinal cannabis, with the expansion of the compassionate access programme.

I would like the figure for previous years.  There is no need to go into the exact figures, it is just a general question.  Let us presume settlements amounted to &euro;347 million.  What would the SCA have provided for in respect of the cases that were to be settled?  Had the SCA allowed for perhaps &euro;247 million or something closer to &euro;547 million or what was provided for prospective settlements?  How close was the SCA's estimate?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen is telling us what is accumulating.  We are underestimating the costs and that leads me to ask how often does the SCA revalue its cases?  Let us take the example of a case that comes in and all of the legal papers have been served.  It is then adjudged that it is a case worth &euro;1 million.  As the months go by, however, more information may become available.  Is there a systematic method in place which is regularly used to reassess cases when more information is received?  Would a case then be adjusted to state that it might now cost &euro;2 million in light of the new information received?  Does the SCA adjust its overall figures and what is the mechanism for doing that?  I am not looking for information immediately.

On behalf of Allianz, I very much welcome the time and effort that the committee is putting into this, as it is an important topic for businesses, consumers and the economy as a whole.  I confirm for the committee and for businesses and consumers that if the cost of claims in Ireland falls, insurance premiums will fall.  Today&rsquo;s meeting is a further and important step in the continuing work to bring about a mechanism to appropriately and fairly reduce the cost of claims and, therefore, the cost of insurance.<\/p> <p>  Before looking at the claims issue, it would be appropriate to give a little background to Allianz and our long-term and deep commitment to Ireland and our customers on a 32-county basis.  I am the chief executive of Allianz in Ireland, which has had a continuous presence in general insurance in Ireland for 117 years.  We have served businesses and consumers since 1902.  Currently, we employ 660 people in the provision of general insurance.  We provide a wide variety of products serving small businesses, large companies, social, voluntary and community organisations, as well as personal consumers.  We are proud to have made a contribution to Irish business and community life over those 117 years.  Our contribution goes beyond serving the insurance needs of our customers and we do this through our long-standing programme of sponsorship and support for arts and community-related projects throughout the country.  Allianz Ireland is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Allianz group, which is one of the largest global multiline insurers.  It has a proven market leading position and a very solid capital base.  It operates high standards of governance and risk management practices and it requires all its subsidiaries to adhere to these principles.  In Ireland, the Allianz group employs a total of close to 1,700 people through its many different businesses.<\/p> <p>  Regarding today's agenda, we share the committee's concern and the concerns of many members of the public about the cost and availability of insurance in the Irish market and, in particular, the high cost of claims here compared to other jurisdictions.  Claims costs are a core driver of the availability of insurance cover and premiums charged.  Many business owners and individuals have understandably been very vocal on the topic, so how do we fix the problem?  There are a number of factors to consider, including the high level of injury awards made for claims in Ireland, the legal costs incurred through those claims and the level of fraudulent and exaggerated claims, which are a consequence of the high level of awards.<\/p> <p>  The biggest issue to be addressed is getting the high level of injury awards under control.  In case there is any doubt, we now have a clear and independently assessed picture of the scale of the problem based on the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, report published last year.  The findings of that report were clear and demonstrated that the awards for general damages, excluding special damages and legal costs, in the Republic of Ireland are 4.4 times those in the UK.  Addressing this issue is a complex challenge and it involves addressing the claims environment in Ireland.  Meaningful reform of the claims environment will ensure a stable and sustainable cost of insurance for businesses and consumers.  We welcome the progress made to date and, in particular, the recommendations of the cost of insurance working group.  These recommendations have the ability to recalibrate the level of awards and associated cost of claims in the market.  This will have a material impact on premiums paid by businesses and consumers.<\/p><p>To address the level of awards, we need to examine the role of the book of quantum currently used by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which is directly influenced by the awards set in the courts.  We welcome the provision in the Judicial Council Bill which will give the judicial council responsibility for setting new guidelines for personal injury compensation by the courts and reviewing them regularly.  In this scenario, both the courts and PIAB could use one single and consistent set of guidelines for the level of awards.  We believe such a change will bring the Republic of Ireland more in line with other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland where the judiciary establishes the guidelines for awards in the courts, known as the green book, leading to awards there which are lower than they are here for comparable injuries.  The Civil Liability (Capping of General Damages) Bill 2019 from Senator Lawlor on the capping of general damages is a significant proposal which we would like to see implemented.<\/p><p> While these changes will help to bring consistency in the awards levels, lower premiums will only be possible if the level of awards, especially soft tissue awards, are significantly reduced.  A reduction in the level of awards, coupled with the establishment of an efficient process for the settlement of claims, is vital if we are to reduce premiums.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its work in this area.  I reassure the committee that Allianz is committed to doing whatever it can to assist in the reforms that we believe are necessary in the Irish insurance market.  It is only with real and substantial reforms, especially addressing the single biggest issue, the disproportionately high level of awards, that we will be able to move away from the abnormally high cost of claims in Ireland and towards a lower cost of insurance for businesses and consumers.  I will be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019070400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>I am here today to represent AXA Insurance which is the key operating business in Ireland of one of the world's largest insurance companies, the French headquartered AXA Group.  AXA has been present in Ireland since 1999 when we acquired the Guardian Royal Exchange company which had itself previously acquired the business of PMPA, so we represent a business which has been providing insurance in this market since 1721, almost 300 years ago.  The wider AXA Group employs more than 2,000 people in Ireland in various businesses.  Those businesses include AXA Partners, AXA MPS, AXA XL, Architas, AXA Global Health and AXA Life Europe.  AXA has a long, growing and deep commitment to this market.  In AXA Insurance, we employ 1,200 staff across both the Republic and Northern Ireland.  We operate in all channels of the market here and we offer products directly to consumers and via intermediaries and partners.  Through these products, AXA provides critical support to the social and economic life of the country.  AXA has one of the widest underwriting acceptance criteria in the marketplace in motor insurance for both personal and commercial purposes and our products enable companies and individuals to go about their business with confidence.<\/p> <p>  I understand the committee is particularly interested in the difficulties being experienced with the cost and availability of motor, home, business and public liability insurance.  There has been a very significant focus in recent months on the cost and availability of insurance and some strong criticism of recent trends in the market amid suggestions of excessive profitability by insurance companies such as us.  The reality is that the Irish market is relatively small in international terms.  It is equivalent to less than 10% of the UK market and it is very competitive, with more than 30 different companies competing here.  It has also proven to be a difficult market in which to develop a sustainable and profitable business with high and volatile claims costs.  We are all aware of the high-profile companies which launched in this market only to withdraw or fail as times got tougher.<\/p> <p>  The Irish market was not profitable for motor and liability insurance between 2013 and 2017.  The Irish insurance industry paid out &euro;1.1 billion more in this period than it collected in premiums from customers for motor and liability insurance.  The overall insurance market results improved in 2017 when, for every &euro;100 we collected from customers we paid out &euro;96 in claims and expenses, leaving the industry with an underwriting profit of &euro;4 for each &euro;100 collected.  For our part, we believe we have developed a strong business model that can sustain us through various economic cycles that we expect to encounter.  In the motor and home insurance markets, we have grown to a relatively strong position compared with the market generally.  We continue to seek to compete and grow in new market areas, and we are currently competing very strongly to grow our position in the agriculture and small business sectors where traditionally we have had a small presence.<\/p> <p>  We are currently profitable, but by its nature insurance is a long-term business and we measure our performance over cycles of years rather than months.  Over these horizons, we have had good years and poor years, and on average we have made profits adequate to justify the significant investment which our parent company has made in this market.  This is an important point as there have been examples recently of companies offering insurance products in this market which were not regulated here and which went out of business, resulting in difficulties to consumers and to other market participants.<\/p> <p>  On the steps that might be taken that could facilitate reductions in premiums, I will highlight three areas which are especially relevant to our core market of motor insurance.  First, there could be reform of how the courts decide damages in cases of whiplash and soft tissue damage.  Awards for minor whiplash and soft tissue injuries in this market are 4.4 times that of our nearest neighbour and most comparable legal system.  AXA supports the efforts of the Government to set up a judicial council with the task of redrawing guidelines for awards in injury cases.  It is hoped that whatever guidelines emerge would be regarded by the public as fair and reasonable for the various categories of injuries.  The guidelines should be sufficiently well-defined that everybody should know with reasonable certainty the value of any particular claim.  Should this happen, then the problem of judicial inconsistency should cease, leading to less recourse to the court and reduced legal fees, meaning lower claims costs.<\/p> <p>  Second, there could be reform of the workings and legal basis of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  PIAB was a success when introduced and directly led to a fall in insurance premiums of approximately 40%, but in the years since the legal profession has found ways to work around PIAB and the system encourages lawyers to do just that.  Its effectiveness has been significantly undermined as a result.<\/p> <p>  Third, we should do more to contain fraud.  I am greatly encouraged by the increasing focus on this issue in the wider community and in the media.  For our part, we have invested very substantial resources to tackle fraud and to discourage those who might consider it.  Our special investigations unit was established in 2002 and was the first dedicated unit in the insurance industry set up to tackle this issue.  We note with some concern that even in cases where a judge may dismiss a case due to evidence of fraud or exaggeration, there seem to be no consequences for the plaintiff or their legal counsel.  None of these issues will transform the cost or availability of insurance but each has an important role to play.  I look forward to any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019070400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Bradley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to allow FBD to give a view on the cost and availability of insurance in Ireland.

We have 34 branches and employ 900 people in Irish towns throughout the country.  We have direct relationships with our customers, writing 95% of our business directly and not through brokers.<\/p><p>Farm, food and agriculture remains our most important customer group to this day.  Some 85% of all our premiums are with small and medium businesses - we are writing insurance for the shops, the pubs, the restaurants, the tradesmen and farms that make up the backbone of the economy.  Our customers&rsquo; businesses are predominantly those that are family-owned and managed.  We survive and prosper on Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and success and on our customers&rsquo; growth and success.  It is the strength of our relationships with these customers and the quality of the service we provide them that has underpinned our business for 50 years.  Like all good businesses, we know that our success is linked to our customers&rsquo; success.<\/p><p> We are proud of our contribution to and track record in Irish business life.  We believe in the social utility of our product.  Opening and operating a business in Ireland today is not for the faint-hearted.  There is plenty of risk in it, as any business person will say.  However, no small business could even start to hang out an \"open for business\" sign, no individual could borrow to buy a house, unless the risk of a fire or the risk of being sued if someone trips is taken away from them.  Insurance is a cornerstone of entrepreneurship.  FBD has served many Irish businesses and continues to do so.  We want to grow our business.  FBD competes through our risk selection and our pricing, and through the men and women who meet the customers, work up health-and-safety practices and underwrite those businesses and farms.  We compete again and again with the huge multinationals that operate here and also with naive foreign capacity that is not regulated here and that comes in with unrealistically low prices for a few years in the belief that Ireland will behave in the same way as the greater Manchester area, and then, after a few years, when the losses are unsustainable, they quit, leaving a destruction in their wake and the rest of the market with no background or expertise in the classes of business they wrote.  This is what happened with play centres.<\/p><p> FBD is writing difficult risks and writing some of these at a loss.  Examples of the risks include marts, piggeries, poultry farms, pubs, shops, hotels and agricultural contractors.  We are committed to our sectors and we are providing stability.  FBD very much wants to write more business.  For example, we wrote over 200 new shop accounts in 2018.  We want to grow geographically, particularly in the major urban centres, and we recently opened new offices in Limerick and Cork city and two in Dublin.<\/p><p> There are many factors which influence the cost of insurance for the Irish customer but chief among these is the high cost of bodily injury claims.  Injury awards are also significantly higher in Ireland than elsewhere.  At the simplest level, and if we take the example of the play centres again, the average public liability award at the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, is &euro;27,000.  If the premium for a business is &euro;2,500, then, if there is even one claim in ten years, the ten-year premium will not exceed one single average PIAB award, never mind a claim that goes to court.  How many businesses in today&rsquo;s environment, where the courts apply a duty of care so high and where modern standards for health and safety place all onus on the operator - and, sadly, in the context of the absence of individual responsibility once the person walks onto the business premises, not to mention those who may be trying it on - will withstand that test of one claim in ten years, let alone one where minors are involved?<\/p><p> It is our belief that structural reforms are necessary in order to moderate the cost of such claims in the future.  The current one-way bet in the courts system must change.  It provides an incentive for those who want to have a go and each and every case, no matter how spurious, must be defended.  That costs money.  Absent such structural reform and in this prevailing interest rate environment, the current high cost of insurance is solely a function of the cost of its current inputs, which means predominantly claims costs, particularly soft tissue claims.  As a society, we have a choice: we can encourage entrepreneurship and business through lowering the cost of insurance or we can continue to be the most generous payer in Europe.  Our current injury compensation system is directly at odds with business.  We cannot have it all.  Cheap insurance is an economic impossibility in this environment.  Society must choose.<\/p><p> FBD is charging more than it was five years ago &ndash; that is incontrovertible.  However, I would like to tackle the false idea that we are making outsize profits at the expense of our customers.  It is difficult to sell price increases and no business likes to lose customers.  However, if we take it as a given that, unlike other businesses, on the day we make a sale, we do not know the cost of goods sold because we do not know how many claims we will have, we can see that an insurance business can be inherently risky and difficult to get right.  FBD has come out of a period of five years in which we have written cumulatively &euro;1.8 billion in insurance premia.  Our underwriting profit for that period was &euro;22 million.  This represents a tiny net margin of 1.2%.<\/p><p> FBD is an open book in transparency terms.  As a result of the fact that we are a public company, all of this information is published on our website.  These are not outsize profits.  The company and its employees have completed a major turnaround to make a profit of &euro;50 million in the last two years, and we are proud of that.  For these two years, this represents a normal double-digit return on equity.  What we have accomplished has been difficult.  All our customers are paying more, we have lost some customers, we have lost 150 jobs, we shut down some businesses, we sold our hotels, we raised capital, we stopped our dividend, we changed our board structure and changed management and we invested in technology and skills.  We are now healthy and stable and paying a dividend again.  FBD is a business.  It has shareholders who put their money at risk and they expect us to make a return.  Like all businesses, we do not apologise for making a profit.<\/p><p> FBD is ambitious for growth and success.  We are targeting specific markets for growth, including farms, homes, shops, pubs, restaurants and motor.  However, if we are to survive as the last remaining Irish company competing with gigantic international names, like some of those the committee has just heard from, we must observe the rules of business, reward those who put their capital at risk and provide a service that differentiates us from the competition.  FBD does this by being close to its customers, understanding their business and operating alongside them in our communities.  We are open for business.  We want more customers but we do not and will not sell below cost.<\/p><p> We believe the economy and the customer are best served by a strong, independent local operator focused on long-term relationships with its customers.  In other words, a company just like ours.  This means that we must continue to survive and thrive in this crowded market, where lawyers take home 40% of all court awards made, where international names disclose little and operate to different capital standards and where foreign-regulated competitors come and go at will, with little thought for the market disruption they leave in their wake.<\/p><p> FBD is charging an economic price for an excellent product and service.  We are contributing to the economy.  After much work, we are finally making a fair profit.  FBD shares the frustrations of our customers.  I have been in this job for more than four years, calling for reform.  To encourage business and entrepreneurship, to lower insurance costs, there is no quick win.  Tackle the legal system, the level of awards, the speed of access to court and the amount it costs to access it.  Tackle the impossible standards that small businesses are held to in a personal injury court case, and the total responsibility they must take for anyone crossing their threshold.  Look at the enormous sums of money being made by the legal profession on bodily injury awards.  Look at the vested interests.  This is not an easy problem to solve and only hard yards on complex issues will solve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019070400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Muldoon for reading here her statement into the record.

In that time, it is subject to many influences and variations, whether due to inflation, changes in the courts, changes in regulations and so on.

We know there are too many claims and that those claims are costing too much.  One part of this equation is the discussion around too many people taking claims, the awards being too high and then the cost of getting to a decision being too high.  Of those three elements, if we focus on the award being too high, the compensation element, we have discussed the need for the judicial council, the need for it to come up with a book of quantum, the need for that book to value claims at approximately one fifth of what they are now, and the need for the courts to apply that consistently.<\/p> <p>  The other side of the equation, which probably is the subject of less debate, is the cost of getting to a decision.  That is quite onerous and expensive.  To colour it, so to speak, I will give some quick examples around the cost versus the settlement amount.  What I am talking about here is the need for reform of the legal system.  These are recent enough cases.  The settlement amount in a work related stress claim was &euro;60,000.  The plaintiff costs were &euro;73,000.  Compensation of &euro;15,500 was awarded for a slip and fall in a car park.  The plaintiff costs were &euro;16,200.  The settlement amount for a finger injured unloading a product from a lorry was &euro;12,500.  The agreed plaintiff costs were &euro;20,000.

There are a host of other reports before and after that.  It is an absolute requirement to grab that nettle to bring down costs of insurance.

The Deputy asked an interesting question on fraud versus exaggeration and where the line can be drawn between fraud, for example, staging an accident, and a case where someone is exaggerating significantly.  First and foremost, we are in the job to pay claims and look after people who are injured and suffer loss or damage.  The amount of exaggeration and how our system is feeding that is much more significant than what I might call the pure fraud, although I do not like to use that term.  To give an example, we hardly see a soft tissue injury in a very minor accident that does not have psychological trauma associated with it.  MRI scans are being widely used to look for degenerative change and beef up the claims that are coming through to us.  There is much more use of pain management consultants to find the pain and then treat it.  This all feeds into a very long process that can be stretched out over three, four, five, six or seven years.  Essentially, what is happening is that a case is being built and that case is resulting in very exaggerated claims.  One other example of exaggeration that would not have been a feature previously is the cost of care.  This care cost is absolutely necessary in cases where people are badly injured, and we pay large amounts in catastrophic and very sad, tragic cases.  What we now have are claims that are coming in for cost of care for people with very minor soft tissue injuries.  They need people to do their gardening and domestic chores.  That is not classified as fraud but to the man on the street and certainly from my perspective, that exaggeration is driving up the cost of the claim and the payouts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019070400002#H03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jackie McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>Mr. McMahon makes the point that 20% of claims are fraudulent or suspected fraudulent claims.

In October 2002, we had before the committee representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation, for example, which was the predecessor of Insurance Ireland.  They gave us a list of reforms which would match price reductions from the industry.  They told us that the road safety strategy, for example, would result in a 10% reduction in claims costs, that a reduction in the number of uninsured drivers would result in a 5% reduction, that anti-fraud measures would result in a 1.75% reduction, and so on.  The industry is completely unwilling to provide what it provided over 15 years ago.  Why?  If we are willing to bring in the reforms, why is the industry not willing to say, \"If you do this, we will reduce premiums by X, Y and Z\"?

It is a business, it seeks to make a profit.  The only alternative to that is the State provision of insurance and I suppose we would have to go nine rounds on whether the State could be as efficient as a privately run business seeking to make a profit and a return for its shareholders.  In the absence of a State run system and the inefficiencies that a State run system would be likely to bring with it, we have a heavily competitive capitalist, free market based system, where we are making modest return on equity to reward our shareholders.  Our shares are for sale everyday in the public market and our shareholders are putting their money at risk.<\/p> <p>  I believe we are heavily competitive in the farm sector, which is the sector we know best.  I apologise for using it as an example again.  We have heard from our French colleagues that they have entered the farm market.  There are others competing, including the Swiss and the British.  If we are charging a price that is unsustainable, I am sure my German colleagues will join us.  It is a competitive market and the market sets the price.

The most useful thing to come out of today's meeting relates to causation and fraud.  If one sees somebody commit a crime, whether an assault or otherwise, one will report it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What makes insurance fraud any different?  We see from the numbers that fraud is a minute number so we need to take it off the table.  We need transparency.  We have been working on this for approximately three years to try to get to the bottom of things and achieve transparency.  The messages we get all the time, depending on who is before us, is \"Do not look here, we need you to look there.\"  The media have a role to play in terms of the headline figures and in investigating, in drilling down, like my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, did this morning, and obtaining actual facts and not headline figures.  I think our session this morning has been useful.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms Muldoon's comments on profits.  There is nothing whatsoever wrong with any company making a profit.  That is what companies do, profit maximisation.  There is no problem with that whatsoever, but the industry has to take cognisance of the very many businesses, some operating for generations, the insurance industry has pushed out of business.  The mental and financial stress that these small businesses have had to go through because of the significant premiums, although it is not the only contributing factor, imposed on them by Government in the first instance because insurance is compulsory and by insurance companies which set the premiums without any explanation as to why they have to pay the amount.  We have said right from the beginning, in terms of the mistakes of the industry, the consumers are the collateral damage.<\/p> <p>  If one is looking at a 50% profit, people do not expect to get a 50% increase in their wages in one year.  It is too much and too soon and it is not reflected in the premiums.

I am looking at 50 divided by 370, which is approximately 13.4%.  This is the question I am posing.  The company representatives say they are looking to make margins of 6% for Allianz, 5% for AXA and 8% approximately for FBD.  They have made well above those margins in 2018.  Why was some element of the profit above the margin sought not passed back to reduced premiums?  The companies cannot simply blame it on legal fees or the fraudulent aspect.  The company representatives need to explain it to me and to the ordinary person.  The companies are profitable.<\/p> <p>  Insurance companies have to make a profit but they cannot be fleecing the customer.  This is the question for us.  We have a body of work to do.  It is not personal.  This is an issue.  We have had the legal profession in.  Their fees are excessive.  I also believe there is an issue within the insurance industry.  We are coming here looking at figures on the day.  I have not had hours to prepare but we can see the figures in stark terms.  The companies are profitable.  In fact, I would say they were super-profitable in 2018.  The companies earn well above the margins they are required to make.  Why was that increased profit in some element not passed back to the consumer?  The company representatives might deal with that question.  I have limited time.<\/p> <p>  I am being specific for a reason because I think it is all about facts.  The facts are that the insurance industry is before us today.  We have to probe the figures.  The figures show that the companies are profitable above the margins they are required to make.  Allianz got approximately 7.4%.  It was looking for 6% and made &euro;37 million.  AXA made &euro;89 million and looked for 5% marginal but secured 11.5%.  FBD looked for 8% and got 13.4%, which is well above the target and corresponds to &euro;50 million.  Will the company representatives deal with that specific point?

These figures do not match Ms Muldoon&rsquo;s figure, which appears to be consistent with those of both AXA and Allianz and which point to proportions of roughly 70% in awards and 30% in legal costs.  Mr. McMahon might comment on that.  He might also indicate which of the four cases went to court and which were settled outside court.<\/p> <p>  I am probably being somewhat bit direct but my main purpose is to get to the truth.  The problem is that we are led to believe by the insurance companies that it is all about legal costs and we are led to believe by the legal profession that it is all about insurance costs.

I am very pleased to be here to discuss my supplementary report which was published a couple of weeks ago.  As the committee knows, when I started the scoping inquiry in May last year, there were six laboratories that we knew about.  By the time I had finished and published my main report in September the number was 11.  We had only uncovered some of them shortly before I published the report.  As I was not convinced that we had got to the bottom of the matters to do with the additional laboratories, I suggested to the Minister that there be a supplementary report on them.  That is what is before the committee.  As committee members know, by the time I had finished my supplementary report the number of laboratories had risen to 16.  As well as dealing with those issues, the report also deals with the accreditation systems.<\/p><p>We found out that there were two accreditation systems.  Questions were raised about the comparability of those two systems, and rightly so.  That is an issue we looked at and reported on in the supplementary report.  At the heart of much of what the report deals with are the issues of procurement, contracting and how those were conducted and enforced, or not enforced and not operated.  There is one final section, which is short, but which outlines how we deal with error and my concern that the system for dealing with clinical error is not fit for purpose.  That is a brief summary of what is in the report.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1524,"content":"<p>We will try to keep it to one round of questions.

I want to start by thanking the witnesses and acknowledging the work they have done.  They were brought into the eye of a storm with a lot of political heat, but much more importantly, there were a lot of women all over the country who were very worried and scared about questions on the clinical quality of the testing that had been done, the labs that were being used and so forth.  The expertise and hard work of the witnesses over the past year on several reports has gone a long way to addressing that, so I acknowledge that work and thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  In a few minutes I will get into some of the questions on these extra labs.  Many of us were shocked, as I imagine the witnesses were, that we went from six labs to 11 labs to 16 labs.  That raised serious questions around how this happened and if the labs were of sufficient quality and so forth.  That was detailed in the report and I will move to that in a second but before I do that, I want to step back from the detail.  There are still many women around the country whose confidence in this programme has been shaken.  My understanding of the programme is that it has been highly effective in terms of clinical outcomes, with about a 7% reduction year on year in cervical cancer that can be linked back to the start of the programme.  It was not happening anyway.  There is a link there that presumably is a causal relationship.  As an ancillary, there will be many other people looking at the other screening services and asking if bowel screening and breast screening are in good shape because these questions have been raised about CervicalCheck.<\/p> <p>  My understanding of Dr. Scally's first report is that at a clinical level, putting aside the real issues around governance that were uncovered, the programme as it ran and as it still runs to this day, is of the highest quality and the issues that have surfaced are issues of governance and non-disclosure, which are very real issues around a patient's right to know.  Ultimately, however, at a clinical level, this has been and remains clinically sound at the top international levels and women in Ireland who are looking at CervicalCheck have every reason to have confidence in the clinical efficacy of the programme and its ability, imperfect as it is, to help to detect and treat cervical cancer and pre-cancer.  That is my understanding but I would really like the witnesses' views.  Is that still the view of the witnesses, having had many more months to look into the weeds even further?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#C00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>That is a good point and it is worthwhile to reinforce that it is a good programme and that is has produced real results.  The potential for it produce outstanding results is great.  That is ironic because it is almost as a result of the attention that has been paid to it in recent years.  I know from talking to the women and the affected families that they want it to be an excellent programme and they are totally committed to it.  At some of the meetings, it has been interesting to see that if there is criticism of the programme, it is not about the principle of the programme or the general operation of same, it is about the way this particular issue was handled.<\/p> <p>  On international comparability, CervicalCheck stands up well.  We looked at the quality assurances around the other screening programmes during the main report but we did so on a very superficial level.  As the Deputy will appreciate, we got into far more problematic areas in the cervical screening programme than I could have ever imagined so that is where our concentration was.  We did not find majorly problematic areas in the other programmes.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that some of the changes the HSE has put in place have not just been around the cervical screening programme, but across the whole management of the programmes.  It has brought in people who I am convinced will improve the situation, improve the management and improve the coherence of it.<\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Denton to comment on this because she has a considerable amount of international experience and this issue of comparability is something that she and I discussed recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1527,"content":"<p>It compares well with cervical cancer prevention strategies that are operable in many other countries.

There are not so many countries that have an organised screening programme like that.  It is starting off in a positive position and, as Dr. Scally said, the moves to improve the sensitivity of the test by moving towards HPV screening as a primary screening test are under way as I understand it.

That is where the problem is in terms of clinical services, which is why I have always advocated for an attempt at reconciliation between the clinician and the woman.  I know women who have taken the matter into their own hands.  I have spoken to their clinicians and made it a point specifically to discuss what happened and find the truth about the non-disclosures.

Obviously, many women are very uncertain and anxious about delayed tests and they may question the accuracy of the test results when they get them.

In my main report, I identified that one of the major problems was that very few staff members had a current job description.  I have discussed that with the HSE.  The Chair's question is a good one and it should be addressed to the HSE.  I will continue to discuss the matter with it.

In the supplementary report, I pointed out the difference between screening programmes and normal healthcare.  Screening programmes are done on a mass basis and are reliant on the quality of the tests and those who read them when there is a visual element.  They are also reliant on the cost-benefit aspect.  A very good example is the decision of the United States to shift its guidelines from having annual tests to having three yearly or five yearly tests.  It did so on the basis that if it tested too often, such as annually, more women would be identified with problems which, over time, would resolve by themselves.  Those women would undergo unnecessary treatment.  The side effects of some of that treatment, such as premature labour and miscarriage, may outweigh any potential benefit from a problem being picked up on in the test.  There is a balance to be struck, although that does not enter into a judgment in an individual case in which an issue that ought to have been identified was not.<\/p><p>The overall balance of a screening programme is different from the balance of any one case.<\/p><p> I refer to the question of the absolute certainty of someone carrying out a screening test.

It is very welcome.  The witnesses have said that CervicalCheck is a decent programme for an organised screening programme.  That is true.  I am more than happy to say that I am a beneficiary of that programme in more ways than one and am grateful for it in many respects.  When this issue first came to light, many disrespectful comments were directed at the women who use the service, implying that we did not understand that it was a screening service or that we thought it was diagnostic.  We did not think that, because most of us speak to our doctors.  We are adults, otherwise we would not be having the test in the first place.  The problems lay in the withholding of information, which is a fundamental aspect of this report.<\/p><p>It strikes me that Dr. Scally's job in chasing down where the issues were would have been much easier if those laboratories had been based here in Ireland.  The decision to outsource the testing was political rather than clinical, according to the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine, which never advised it.  In fact, the opposite is true, in that it sought a small amount of investment from the Government at the time to upskill labs and make them fit for purpose in order that we could continue to test here.  That is not to say that the same issues regarding withholding information would not have occurred here.  That may have still been an issue but we would have had the capacity to cite the laboratories and find out exactly where the tests were.  Many women were concerned when they found out first that there was outsourcing, which was bad enough, but that the tests were then re-outsourced and in some instances even re-outsourced again.  That is worrying.  I refer to page 36 of Dr. Scally's supplementary report, which states:<\/p><blockquote>The NCSS specifically stated that they would &lsquo;<i>not be supportive of this aspect of the plan<\/i>&rsquo;, but when issuing a new request for tender later in the same year, the NCSS reduced the focus on capacity by almost eliminating it from the scoring despite these issues having occurred.<\/blockquote> <p>The report also shows that quality assurance declined from a 25% weighting in 2008 to a 15% weighting by 2012.  That is screening on the cheap, to use layman's terms.  It reduces the emphasis on quality and capacity and increases the emphasis on price.  CervicalCheck was chasing down costs and was not keeping a close eye on quality.  My understanding is that site visits for quality assurance purposes were not conducted.  That is clear, because if they had been conducted we would have known where the sites were.  I asked Dr. Scally about this when we met previously, but I am interested in why price reductions were pursued instead of quality and capacity.  The outsourcing of the tests occurred because we were told there was a capacity issue at the time.  That could have been dealt with here in this State but was not, and was then outsourced for that reason.  Are the witnesses confident that, when the television cameras are shut off, a heavier emphasis on quality will now prevail, in order to ensure this does not happen again?  Could they also offer a view as to who was driving the agenda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#E00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1547,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. McQuillan would like to come in on this at some point.  The situation is slightly worse than it would appear on the bald reading of the figures.  Some things would have changed regardless, because certain factors were altered during subsequent tenders so that instead of giving a weighting, they became pass or fail issues.  One would then expect the factors that were left to have an increased percentage rather than staying still or decreasing.  The Deputy is quite right on that.  We did not come across any reason in the documentation for why those factors were subject to such substantial reductions in weighting.  One can only assume that price became a much more important factor in the process and CervicalCheck was seeking to stimulate as much competition as possible and to drive down the price.  I cannot see how there could be any other explanation for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1548,"content":"<p>It was stated in the final report from September of last year that much of the original procurement process documentation, from ten or more years ago, was incomplete.

That suggests the service was seen more as a commodity than as something driven by quality.  It is surprising that it was at such a low level.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Scally mentioned earlier, we have been engaging recently with the HSE to look at the implementation of the recommendations from September of last year.  We believe there is now a much greater focus within the HSE on the qualitative aspects of the tests, both in the arrangements it is currently entering into with laboratories and in the inspections and detailed work it is undertaking to visit sites and examine the arrangements in place.

If we are comparing with other jurisdictions, I would like us to fare well in comparison with jurisdictions which emphasise quality.  I say this as someone with a material interest in this screening programme.  We can tick the box of the administrative stuff, in that women get their letters, their results, their follow-ups, and their next letters, and it is not easy for someone to slip through the system.  If someone moves house and misses their letter, there is even an advertisement on the radio to remind them.  It is well organised in that way.  However, to compare favourably with other jurisdictions we should be doing well, not just on the administrative side, which we clearly are, but also in driving quality and capacity upfront, rather than focusing on price all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#E00600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1550,"content":"<p>Yes.

We now know what happened in Manchester in January and the process in which he subsequently had to find out that there were issues with accreditation even though Dr. Scally had to take MedLab's word for it previously.  The women of Ireland and patient representatives really want to know if there was a thorough investigation by the team of all the laboratories rather than taking the word of the laboratories.

I recall that on the day I was appointed I made the point that when things go wrong people generally want three things: they want to know the truth about what went on; they want to know that it will not happen to anyone else; and they would really like someone who was responsible and involved to say sorry to them.  All of the evidence shows that achieving those three things can resolve a huge number of the concerns of the patients involved.  My experience in dealing with the CervicalCheck problem is that people are often resorting to legal action because they cannot get any answers any other way.  I think that is a terrible pity.  It should not be like that.  I am not convinced that, having gone through a legal action, it necessarily gets a person to the truth either because judges are in a very difficult position in that they can only make a judgment on the basis of the evidence that is placed before them.  They cannot have an investigatory element to their work and so they have to decide a case for or against.  I do not think this necessarily brings closure for people.  I know from talking to the women and the relatives that they are interested in knowing what went wrong and why it went wrong, and they would really like someone to say sorry, particularly to the women who were so badly treated in the open disclosure.  They would like an apology, not in a letter from someone they have never heard of high up in the organisation but from the people who did not treat them properly.  I think those are all reasonable things.

They were both talking about how the non-disclosure had affected them and they had lost confidence in their clinician.  They were both, independently, thinking of shifting to the other woman's clinician.  They told that story and it was the only humorous part of that entire meeting.  Those women found it humorous but it was also tragic because they had lost confidence in their clinicians.

I hope someone at some stage in the next year or two reviews all of the codes of conduct for all health professionals to see what is in there and ensure that expectations of all our health professionals include that they are open, frank and honest with patients.

We all have different roles here so I apologise in advance.  I want to focus on the guy in the laboratory in Salford or Manchester first.

To my mind, accreditation is the competence to do a test, and it is a bit late to get it when the test has already been done.<\/p> <p>  I read the report when it came out and read it again last night.  How could Dr. Scally assume that a lack of accreditation had no impact?  I hope I am wrong but my argument would be the following.  There is a test with an accuracy rate of 70% and someone in a laboratory is getting a certain number of slides which then go into the mix with the rest of the medical laboratory slides.  I know, from our most recent meeting, that it says on the slide which laboratory it was tested in.  I imagine that is how our guests found out although perhaps it is not.  Those slides are then thrown in with all the other slides and all the different cohorts of patients as we have discussed over the past year.  I am trying to be as helpful as possible, but if the man from that laboratory in Salford had just left those slides in the boot of his car and, when the deadline to return them arrived, brought them in, signed his name on them and never tested them, it would make no material difference to the end figures because he was doing so few of them.  That man's baseline, or that of his laboratory, was never tested.  How can our guests definitively say it had no impact?

Would Dr. Scally be concerned about the retrospective accreditation issue as somebody who, I am sure, is all about standards?  Following on from Deputy Kelly's questioning about how we could have ended up where the lab was never visited, there are limitations in INAB's role outside the jurisdiction - it ticks so many boxes that are wrong.  I am really concerned.  That is why we have to bring INAB into the committee.

It is very clear in the history of the correspondence that it takes about a year to get INAB accreditation.  It is a long process.  It is not a case of the lab in Sandyford ringing up and asking if it is good to go and being told yes.  It is not like that.

If two separate people are screening a slide, then more abnormalities will be detected than if only one person screens it.  The US requirement is for only one person to screen the US-derived slides and to do a 10% rescreen.  Therefore 90% of its negative slides are only being screened by one person.  What was, and still is, being offered to Irish women in those settings is better because they are all having two screens.<\/p> <p>  We are not able to say that the sensitivity of the test in country A is one thing and in country B is another because it is simply not measurable.

The Irish women's slides which went to the United States had two primary level screens which involved the cytoscreener examining the slide for a longer period.

However, it fails to think through some of the consequences or to plan in advance with how they will deal with the information.  I believe that anonymised audits have been done in some places.  It is not normal practice in the UK or any European country that I am aware of.  The challenge is that it cannot be done in a completely anonymised way because it is not only about reviewing the cervical cytology preparations but also examining the patient history, when they attended for screening, whether they were invited correctly, whether the colposcopy and follow on investigations were done correctly, and so on.  It is not possible to take one bit of the pathway and do that.  To link all that information, it must de-anonymise it.

Dr. Scally has stated that this provision is already in the contracts but that he would like it to be made more explicit.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Scally's second recommendation is that a consistent quality assurance process be developed and implemented globally so that, rather than consider the accreditation from another country, CervicalCheck or the HSE would not be interested in that accreditation and would instead set out the accreditation in Ireland that people would have to meet.<\/p> <p>  I am curious to know why what happened with the subcontracting happened.  The HSE contracted in good faith, but it turns out that the lab subcontracted.  I am not going to say whether that was in bad faith, but it certainly seems to have been in breach of contract.  I have reached an observation from our examination of CervicalCheck.  We all think of these State programmes as well-resourced, well-financed and slick operations with plenty of staff, doctors, accountants, lawyers and administrators to do all the work that needs to be done.  CervicalCheck was a world-class programme, but it was actually being run on spit and boot polish.  It was about half of Dr. Flannelly's time and there was a very small staff, including the staff processing the slides and the management staff.  Is it Dr. Scally's conclusion that the HSE and CervicalCheck never spotted this subcontracting because they did not have the required legal expertise?  This is serious stuff involving contract enforcement and supervision and carrying out on-site audits.  Is it the case that the HSE and CervicalCheck did not have the facilities to do that?  If they did, is this something that they should have spotted but failed in their duty to do so?  Where do matters stand today?  It is one thing for us all to talk about what the good people of CervicalCheck should be doing in terms of contract enforcement.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Scally's second recommendation was on developing a robust global quality assurance protocol and enforcing it.  There is no point in just having a document on the shelf.  There must be the scientists, doctors, lawyers, accountants and so on to get on planes and physically travel.  Did CervicalCheck have the requisite firepower to do this?  Does it now have the firepower to implement these recommendations properly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#N00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1796,"content":"<p>Those are good points.  I do not believe that CervicalCheck had the capacity in terms of the quantum of staff nor the skill mix.  Deputy Donnelly mentioned Dr. Flannelly.  She worked on this two days per week.  She was a colposcopist, yet this programme was heavily based on cytopathology.  CervicalCheck had no in-house cytopathology expertise, which was a difficulty.  It is a public health programme, yet there was no consistent public health input.  That would have avoided some of the problems with the construction of the audit.  All of that left CervicalCheck weak in the contracting and tendering arena.  Mr. McQuillan might comment on its capacity in that regard, but it looked to me to be light as well.  CervicalCheck did not manage these contracts.  The contracts should have been actively managed.  CervicalCheck was a passive recipient of what the laboratories chose to give it.  That is my summary.  CervicalCheck needs the capacity to manage contracts actively.<\/p> <p>  There is a positive.  For a long time on behalf of the Department of Health, Mr. McQuillan and I have been examining the public health system and the organisation of public health medicine in the State.

However, we are still examining the issue and will report on it in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane McQuillan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1800,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#N01000","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1801,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy O'Connell, whom I know does not want to be responsible for our witnesses missing their flights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#N01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1802,"content":"<p>When was the San Antonio visit that Mr. McQuillan referenced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#N01200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1803,"content":"<p>CervicalCheck did not visit San Antonio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019070400002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane McQuillan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1804,"content":"<p>I apologise.

The IWA has a vision of an Ireland where people with disabilities enjoy equal rights, choices and opportunities in how they live their lives, and where our country is a model worldwide for a truly inclusive society.  Since the IWA&rsquo;s foundation in 1960 by ten people who were all wheelchair users, one of the single biggest issues facing people with physical disabilities has been access to the built environment, including public buildings such as Leinster House, hotels, retail outlets and footpaths to name but a few.  Over the decades, considerable progress has been achieved with the revision of building regulations, the design of new buildings and retrofitting of older buildings - again such as Leinster House, where there has been much improvement - and the upgrading of roads and footpaths.  This work has supported people with physical disabilities to have more access to the community and to participate in and contribute to society and the economy.<\/p> <p>  However, one of the remaining and ongoing challenges for people with physical disabilities, particularly for people who are wheelchair users, is the distinct lack of suitable and affordable housing, social housing, private housing and private rental housing.  Despite the many achievements of the national housing strategy for people with a disability, IWA members who are wheelchair users and who are registered and approved for social housing have not been receiving offers of housing.  Many people having been on local authority housing lists for years and years with no offer in sight, including some of my colleagues who are present today.  The contribution and recommendations made by the IWA to the Oireachtas committee today are based on the long-standing experiences of its members; on the IWA&rsquo;s experiences as an approved housing body, AHB, and member of the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH; on IWA membership of local housing and disability steering groups, HDSGs, in local authorities; on its membership of the advisory group and monitoring committee to the national housing strategy; and, mainly, from the experiences of IWA members who are full-time wheelchair users.<\/p> <p>  People who are full-time wheelchair users need housing that is designed differently from standard housing, and I do not mean in the form of extras or adaptions.  Standard housing is not built to this type of design, but is built to comply with Part M of the building regulations which requires housing to be visitable.  We would all love to be able to visit a house but we would also like to live in such a house.  In Part M of the building regulations 2010, \"visitable housing\" means where people can safely and conveniently approach and gain access, people can have access to the main habitable rooms at entry level and a WC is provided at entry level.<\/p> <p>  The strategic design and delivery of fully wheelchair accessible social housing is the IWA&rsquo;s focus today in making recommendations to the committee.  The recommendations are intended to support the strategic planning, design and delivery of wheelchair accessible social housing to meet the identified housing needs of people with disabilities who require wheelchair accessible housing.  The IWA recommends the following actions.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should ensure that the local authority application form for social housing support, which is currently being revised, has a specific question to record a wheelchair accessible housing requirement.  Currently, it is quite complex to extract the information on wheelchair accessibility and there are at least three questions to be answered, combined with a general practitioner, GP, and occupational therapist, OT, report, to get the relevant information.  The IWA&rsquo;s recommendation is to include one question asking whether the respondent requires a wheelchair accessible house.<\/p> <p>  The IWA also recommends that the local authority housing IT system be reviewed to reflect the details of the form and have the capacity to generate the relevant reports to support strategic planning and reporting on the delivery of housing.<\/p><p>Every local authority would review its current approved social housing list to identify the number of people who require wheelchair accessible housing.  As we understand it, that information is not readily available in all local authorities.<\/p><p> The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has agreed wheelchair accessible housing design specifications with the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA and other stakeholders, and local authorities will plan strategically to ensure that 7% of every social housing development funded by the Exchequer is designed to be wheelchair accessible, thus promoting sustainable communities.<\/p><p> The Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010 should be reviewed to include wheelchair accessible housing design, similar to the UK.  I look forward to discussing these in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1838,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Siobh&aacute;n Barron to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#E00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1839,"content":"<p>On behalf of the National Disability Authority, NDA, I thank the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for the opportunity to make a presentation on housing for persons with disabilities.  The NDA is an independent statutory body, and while it is not a representative body, it was established to provide independent and evidence-informed advice to the Minister for Justice and Equality on matters of policy and practice relevant to the lives of persons with disabilities.  A function of the NDA is to promote the adoption of a universal design approach to the built environment, products, services and ICT so that they can be easily accessed, understood and used independently to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their age, size, ability or disability.  That broadens the remit of the NDA beyond disability.  The NDA engages with many stakeholders, in particular the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Housing Agency, on issues relevant to persons with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>Based on the returns from Census 2016, we know there are more than 640,000 persons with disabilities in Ireland.  Most persons with a disability will have acquired their disability, especially in adult life.  We are talking about all types of disability, from physical, sensory and intellectual disability to mental health, autism and sensory impairments.  Persons with disabilities are more likely to rely on local authority housing than other citizens - 12.8% compared with 8.3% of the general population.  This arises particularly where persons with disabilities have poorer employment prospects than others, and it is also due to higher costs they may have related to their disability.  Therefore they may be more dependent on the State for support in securing a permanent home.  This generates a demand for more social housing options.<br\/><br\/>The right to adequate housing has its origins in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 and the international conventions that followed.  In particular, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006, UNCRPD, which was ratified by the Government last year, further elaborates on the meaning of the right to adequate housing as it relates to persons with disabilities.  The convention creates a new benchmark for the realisation of the right of persons with disabilities to adequate housing through Article 19, which refers to living independently and being included in the community.  This requires that Ireland delivers on the rights of persons with disabilities to &ldquo;live in the community with choices equal to others&rdquo; and to &ldquo;have the opportunity to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live&rdquo;.  This is at the heart of the policy of decongregation being progressed by the HSE, but is also relevant to persons with disabilities in the community who, for example, may wish to move out of the family home.  Article 28 of the UNCRPD requires the State to deliver on the right to &ldquo;adequate housing&rdquo; and to &ldquo;ensure access by persons with disabilities to public housing programmes&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has made a number of commitments regarding persons with disabilities under various strategies on housing, including the <b>S<\/b>ocial Housing Strategy 2020, Rebuilding Ireland, and in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, NDIS, 2017-2021.  The Department&rsquo;s National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016 has been incorporated into Rebuilding Ireland<b><\/b>and extended to 2020 for delivery.  The NDA was on the Department&rsquo;s advisory group and related subgroups on the development of that strategy, and is on the Department&rsquo;s implementation monitoring group for that strategy.<br\/><br\/>The Department affirms the commitment to implementing the national housing strategy in the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS.  The NDIS is undergoing a mid-term review, and the NDA suggests that there is an opportunity to strengthen actions therein on housing for persons with disabilities.  To date we know a number of actions have been progressed under the national housing strategy, including for example, the designing housing to meet the needs of all toolkit and website as a resource for housing authorities, developers and housing providers to develop and design housing projects to be inclusive, adaptive and accessible.  There are also actions progressed to promote the take-up of the capital assistance scheme, CAS, for persons with disabilities and to streamline the application and decision process.  There was the production of a summary of social housing assessments on households qualified for social housing support who have yet to have their needs met.  A guide by the Housing Agency on the housing assessment and allocation process for persons with disabilities was produced to assist local authority staff in applications and managing waiting lists.  There has been some streamlining of the housing adaptation grants scheme, with rising numbers of grants paid each year.  There have been advances in making housing related application processes more accessible.  Housing and disability steering committees were established in each local authority.  These are just a few examples of what has been achieved, and even within those, further work will be needed to achieve greater impact on access to housing for persons with disabilities.  The NDA has been advising on the various initiatives and will continue to do so within its independent role.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, the NDA notes that there are more goals that have yet to be realised within the national housing strategy, given that it has to be completed next year.  While decongregation of persons with disabilities from institutional living arrangements to community living continues, it has been acknowledged that the original timeframe of 2019 for decongregation will not be met, so that timeframe will need to be extended.  Some of the delays relating in part to access to housing are due to the need to tender and retender for refurbishments and to planning permission issues.  The NDA continues to advise on such matters, including conducting an evaluation project for learning from decongregation. <br\/><br\/>Changes in the structure and delivery of housing benefits cannot alone make it easier for persons with disabilities to secure accommodation.  There are difficulties accessing private rental accommodation not only because of the lack of accessible properties but also because many persons with disabilities are priced out of the rental market.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC&rsquo;s recently published annual report states that it is apparent that there is systemic discrimination against people in general in receipt of housing social welfare payments and that persons with disabilities are more than twice as likely to report discrimination relating to housing and over 1.6 times more likely to live in poor conditions.<br\/><br\/>Scarce resources are, understandably, being directed to dealing with those in emergency accommodation and experiencing homelessness.  The issue of homelessness for those with disabilities and mental health difficulties needs particular attention and the NDA will be funding research on this shortly.  There have been difficulties with a lack of uniformity across the country on combining an offer of housing with the availability of an appropriate care package.<br\/><br\/>We recognise the housing crisis means not enough houses are being built to meet needs, but it is important in addressing this that the right type of housing is being built to meet the needs of persons with disabilities and the changing needs of householders who may acquire a disability over time.  We advise that Part M of the building regulations of 2010 needs to be reviewed and updated, with due regard to the NDA&rsquo;s universal design homes guidelines so that the accessibility standard for new builds would be higher.<br\/><br\/>While we have a summary of social housing needs assessment, further work is required to ensure robust data to plan housing to meet housing needs.  Actively considering the potential for better collection of data on accessible housing and the range of housing available would also be helpful.<br\/><br\/>The type of housing we build, how it is designed and where it is located all impact on the individual.  The long-term benefits from housing, following a universal design approach, could realise savings to the State in health and social care, could help alleviate the challenges presented by climate change and could help improve the well-being and fabric of communities.  The NDA has been engaging with many stakeholders, including local authorities and the Department, on the adoption of a universal design approach to housing.  We welcome the recent commitment by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health, in their recent policy statement on Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, to ensuring that 30% of all new dwellings will be built to incorporate universal design principles to accommodate our ageing population.  We also welcome the report last year of this joint committee in which it recommended looking at universal design and a cost-benefit analysis.  That is included in the NDA's work plan and we will be commencing a scoping exercise on that shortly.  The focus on universal design in older housing stock sets an important precedent that should also prove to be important for persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>The NDA will continue to engage with professional bodies such as Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and third level institutions like the Technological University of Dublin to embed a universal design approach in the relevant academic and professional courses, in order to provide the skilled practitioners that will be required to plan, design and construct universal design homes.  We are also working with bodies and continuous professional development in this regard.<\/p><p> The NDA is also aware of the particular needs of persons with mental health difficulties and the needs of persons with autism.  We have previously published guidelines for persons with mental health difficulties as well as guidance for local authority officers to assist persons with autism. <\/p><p> The NDA has also briefed the Housing Agency about the importance of preparing officials working in local authorities on their potential roles under the Assisted Decision Making Capacity Act 2015.  When the Act is operational, it will be up to local authority housing officers to be as supportive as they can to applicants who may have capacity issues in making decisions on housing.  The Housing Agency has been very proactive in engaging with the NDA about the development of its own guidance in this regard.<\/p><p> Like other countries, our population is living longer and the number of older persons is growing.  It is expected that the numbers of persons with disabilities will increase by approximately 20% by 2026.  This has particular implications for housing and supported living in the community, and the need to ensure a sustainable housing model in Ireland.  There is, therefore, an obligation on all stakeholders involved in planning, design and construction to take action to achieve this.  There are various strategies and policies in place that when fully implemented can help progress access to housing for persons with disabilities in Ireland, particularly as part of mainstream housing developments.  As well as the greater need for social housing, we advise that there should be a greater emphasis on creating liveable and sustainable neighbourhoods where persons with disabilities can live full and active lives as part of a real community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562194800,"counter":1841,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1842,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Barron for her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#F00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1843,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the National Disability Authority and everyone else for their presence.  In particular, I welcome Senator John Dolan who has an amazing track record in advocating for the disability sector, which I am sure is acknowledged by everyone in both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Cunningham and Ms Barron for their quality submissions.  We received other submissions that we have circulated and read.  I thank the representatives for taking us through them again.  The strong message that has come across from all of this is that we should provide the capacity to live independently with dignity and respect in the community.  A home is more than just a house.  Living is more than just a roof over one's head.  Living is about being able to access one's community facilities.  It is about meaningful engagement in one's community.  It is about having equal access to that engagement be it to partake in one's community, employment or whatever.  A lot of the committee's emphasis can be about housing, and bricks and mortar but the organisations present went further and rightly so.  <\/p> <p>  Today's meeting is the first of two meetings on housing for people with disabilities and the second meeting is scheduled for 10 July.  There will be other representatives from local government and Dublin City Council.  Housing is part of a process and what the representatives have shared with us today will feed into the bigger picture of policy, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by recent research conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that shows people with disabilities were twice as likely to experience discrimination when accessing housing, which is profound and disturbing.  We need to do something about the situation.  I make that point because it came out in the literature.  I was not fully aware of such discrimination and only had anecdotal evidence.  However, the other day I spoke to a woman who lives in one of the Dublin local authority areas and she has waited nearly 12 years for housing.  Every time she approaches her authority she is told she can have accommodation eight or nine miles away from where her supports are located.  I mean the people who care about her, love her and are there for her.  When she makes her case she is told that she is choosy and difficult, which she finds very frustrating.  She needs to live on the groundfloor.  She also needs to be able to access a community on the street because that is where she goes out to read her newspaper.  Her limited access allows her to get out in and around there.<\/p> <p>  Earlier today it was clearly confirmed that the targets and timelines to transition people with disabilities away from congregated settings have not been reached.  That is extremely disappointing because this is a group of people who have historically had other issues and difficulties.  The decongregation and transference of people from institutional care back into the community was flagged as being a progressive bit of work.  I live near one of these institutions that is now closed.  The people did not have happy experiences on many occasions and were forced out.  The move was not altogether about making facilities better for them.  They were taken many miles away from where they had lived for ten years and away from where they had built friendships and relationships.  Clearly this is a very important issue so what is the problem with accessing housing?  These people live in congregated settings.  The Government policy is to close these places down and get people out.  I always argue that there will be some people who want to stay in more formal residential settings.  Housing has to be all about rights and choices.  I have met people who have been forced to move from  community settings into independent living arrangements but were not given supports and, therefore, did not like the new arrangement.  We must respect all aspects of this issue.  This is about empowering a person to make decisions about where he or she wants to live.  I ask the witnesses to share their views on this matter.  Is there a process of review?  If so, what is the review mechanism?  What do the witnesses think about Departments and relevant agencies in terms of people being moved from congregated settings into communities?  Why is the transition not happening as fast as first envisioned?  What are the pitfalls and problems?  How does one overcome the pitfalls and problems?<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses share with us their experiences of how local authorities have addressed the public housing needs for people with disabilities?  In my experience, some local authorities are good and progressive yet other authorities tell people they do not have the facilities.  The Part V obligation was mentioned by one of the witnesses.  Sometimes local authorities offset developments, particularly small one-off developments by taking money or by dealing with other issues but these strike me as ideal situations.  <\/p> <p>  The following point was well made in one of the submissions.  We do not want disability zones.  We want people living meaningfully right across the community so it strikes me that there are opportunities for one-off units, particularly in the private sector.  We need to ensure that the target of 7% happens in both the public and private sectors.  Also, there are elderly people who have different degrees of disability.  I ask the witnesses to talk me through this aspect. <\/p> <p>  The Part V obligation is very contentious in some local authorities and they are not delivering.  I ask the witnesses to comment further on the issue. <\/p> <p>  The RIAI has given us a brief questions and answers submission, which the witnesses have not seen.  I am sure that the committee will be happy to circulate it to the witnesses.  The RIAI compared this country with other European countries and said: \"We understand that Ireland has no mandatory standards for either accessible or adaptable housing\", and it is badly needed, with which I agree.  I ask the witnesses to talk us through how they advocate for that because if the work of this committee is to have meaning and take the work of the delegations further, then clearly we need mandatory standards in legislation.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I wish to draw attention to Fingal County Council as it has recently drawn up an excellent document entitled 10 Ways To Construct A More Lifetime Adaptable and Age Friendly Home.  The document is really positive and conveys its message simply.  I appeal to the organisations present to not only engage with local authorities but to engage with the elected members of local authorities because they will find them to be advocates who will advocate for the objectives that we all want.  Sometimes we tend to rely on the executive, architects and housing officials, be they in local authorities or Departments.  I suggest that the organisations present would be much more effective as well as keeping them onboard to advocate and to have a similar engagement with them as they are having with us here.  I urge them to have that engagement with local authorities because it would be fruitful and generate good results.  <\/p> <p>  Again, well done.  I thank the witnesses for their very detailed submissions and ask them to address the few queries that I have raised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#F00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1844,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for acknowledging our input and for his questions.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of decongregation, it is established Government policy to move away from institutional care.  The National Disability Authority has over many years undertaken research, considered the experience in other countries and the quality of life that can be achieved.<\/p><p>We have come across cases where it was believed it would not be possible or it would not work out and people were reluctant to move.  Where it has been done effectively and people have been well supported, it has had immense and incredible benefits for them.  It immensely improved their quality of life.  Effective transition and how people are supported through the process is important.  Decongregating and lining up the right package of supports in the community is a complex process.  The move from traditional services and a culture of care in segregated service provision to an independent living arrangement in a community is a big move.  There is a lot of work to be done with the staff, the services and the community to make that work.  We heard from a stakeholder from another European country that there is a lead-in period of one year for any individual for it to work effectively.  It takes time for a person to get accustomed to the idea, to work through the options in terms of with whom they want to live and where they want to live and to put all of that in place.  We know that sometimes there is inconsistency in terms of lining up care packages and finding accommodation.  In the current housing crisis, finding the right kind of accessible accommodation is proving difficult.  In terms of other policy areas, universal design, for example, can help alleviate some of those pressures.  There are many actors that have a role to play in making decongregation work.<\/p><p> We are engaged in an evaluation project in regard to the situation for 600 persons with disabilities, one quarter of whom are people moving from institutions to the community.  We are interviewing them before they move and after they move to the community to understand the impact the move has had on their lives, their experience and so on.  We are also examining the cost of those new models of support.  The big challenge is access to adequate investment to fund the type of support packages that are needed and funding to support transition and to ensure access to mainstream services within the community.  There are a lot of issues at stake to make decongregation effective.<\/p><p> We are familiar with the ESRI research and other research which indicates that more people with disabilities are living with deprivation.  They are living in poor accommodation and in some of the more deprived areas as well.  This is an issue of affordability of accommodation.  There is even more need to focus on access to housing for persons with disabilities.  We have been engaging with a lot of local authorities.  I take the point in terms of broadening that engagement.  We have had some good experience.  We are very familiar with the Fingal County Council document.  We work closely with the council in that regard.  We welcome that initiative to progress that.  We have seen other positive initiatives by other local authorities, including in Wexford where the authority has set a target of 20% in respect of all housing developments of more than five houses to be of universal design with a focus on access to housing for persons with disabilities.  We need more consistency in this regard.  We have developed technical guidelines in regard to the universal design, which cover three levels of housing.  There is information and guidance to support some type of development of standards and templates for housing for the future.<\/p><p> I hope I have covered all of the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1846,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Barron and I invite Mr. Cunningham to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#G00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1847,"content":"<p>I will start with the congregated settings element, although it is not an area with which we work directly.  In terms of housing, the members of the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, are community-based.  We are talking about people who could be living with their parents and their siblings who have never had the opportunity to have a home of their own due to lack of finance to purchase or build, lack of social housing, lack of available housing to rent and high renting cost.  We are also talking about people who are inappropriately placed in nursing homes and hospitals, people who are homeless who are wheelchair users, and people who have a disability.  These are two very different groups of people.  What is common to everybody is humanity and a person's right to have a home.  We all get institutionalised one way or another, be that in a large institution of 100 rooms or one's family home with one's family, but we get used to that.  As a country, we have an obligation to lead and to encourage people to flourish, to become independent and to experience that which they do not necessarily know.  Many of us can be sheltered within our own workspace, living environment or social environment.  It is through new experiences that one builds confidence.  If someone had asked me 20 years ago to attend a meeting in Leinster House to talk to this committee I would have replied, \"not on your nanny\", yet here I am.  Experiences bring growth.  The Government has to encourage growth and give people the opportunities to grow.<\/p> <p>  IWA's vision is one of Ireland being a country that would lead in terms of its inclusivity.  We are not doing that.  We should be ashamed in terms of the lack of housing for people with disabilities.  In terms of Part 8, an approved housing body can engage with a local authority in regard to the purchase of a housing estate that is being developed that does not comprise any wheelchair accessible housing.  The Irish Wheelchair Association would also like to be able to engage under Part 8 but at the design stage to acquire some units for wheelchair users through capital assistance scheme, CAS, funding.  However, the design and planning stages are completed before the houses are released for purchase to the approved housing bodies or the local authorities.  The local authority, with the support of the Department, will give the go-ahead for these estates because they might comprise 100 three-bedroom, semi-detached, two-storey houses that will house families.  There is no sustainable community in terms of people with disabilities or older people.  Anecdotally, many local authorities would have accepted the funding from the Part V obligation or a one-off house in another location.  For obvious reasons, it could be two or three years before the development comes to its end.  We have an immediate housing need now such that when developers offer one or two units in another location or in an apartment block, the local authorities seize the opportunity to provide somebody with housing immediately.  In my view and that of the Irish Wheelchair Association, we need strategic planning at the early stages to ensure we have inclusive communities throughout Ireland.  Where State funding is being used to provide housing, there must be investment in sustainable housing developments of mixed tenure.  This is provided for in policy.<\/p> <p>  In preparing for this meeting, the thought crossed my mind that we could build a few houses with all of the documentation on this issue.  The intent and the policies exist but early stage design is not happening.  Following on from discussions with various disability organisations, we have proposed that 7% of every development be wheelchair accessible, but not wheelchair exclusive, homes.  This is about the structural design being such that it caters for wheelchair users.  In regard to Part V opportunities, I am sure some of them are availed of but many of them are being lost.<\/p> <p>  On personal assistance, PA, services, the IWA pre-budget submission, which I am sure members have received, calls for an additional 500,000 personal assistance hours nationally for people with disabilities to touch the need that is not being met currently.  There is definitely a clear link between the two issues.  In theory, it all stands up.  We need houses for the personal assistants to kick in but there is no housing.  It is not being designed or built and there does not appear to be any strategic planning around it.  The goodwill is there but the offers are not coming out.  We need both.  We need the PA hours and houses.  Incidentally, all of these issues are contributing to the economy.  If people get their independence, they can work.  Personal assistants are employees as well.  All of this generates income and inclusive societies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1848,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunningham.

All of us here are aware of the importance of housing for people with disabilities.  I sat on the board of the Carlow branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association for eight or nine years and I still attend its AGMs.<\/p><p>At every annual general meeting the first things to come up are lack of housing, footpaths, entrances to buildings and awareness.  Today we need to go forward because, as some of the centre users say, it not until a person is in the position of using a wheelchair or a buggy that he or she realises how bad it is to go to town using footpaths.  Again, that is life and it is not until one's own family is hit by it through having someone with a disability or an elderly person, that we realise.  Awareness of what is happening is so important.<\/p><p> I have constantly said that when it comes to housing we need to talk about what is being built in Ireland and to address the issues.  We seem to be building only one type of housing.  That is concerning because we have many people who are living longer and we have more people with disabilities.  Many houses being built seem tight, especially for wheelchairs.  I notice many of the houses being built recently are not suitable.  I have dealt with older people, people with disabilities and maybe people who have got multiple sclerosis later in life or something like that.  The houses they are actually living in are not able to take a wheelchair.  This is a long-term issue.  These are houses that were built privately or by the local authority.  We need to look at the issue of people who have to use a wheelchair in the long term.  If we build a house, whether it is two-storey house or whatever, it should be fitted on the lower floor for wheelchair accessibility, but many are not.<\/p><p> I have a concern in dealing with local authorities that children with disabilities are not given a preference.  It is concerning that a child might have particular needs within a family.  We need to ensure that happens.  It is a priority for me anyway.<\/p><p> My colleague, Senator John Dolan, has gone to all the local authorities.  I wish to compliment him on the work he has done.  I will outline the figures for my area of Carlow.  We have a population of 56,932 living in Carlow.  Of this, 8,237, or 14%, have at least one disability.  That is why we need to ensure we improve on this for people.  There is definitely an issue with housing.  Over 8,000 people have disabilities.  That is so unfair.  I find in my work representing people with disabilities or those in a wheelchair that they are not made the priority they should be.  We need to look at that.  We may even need to look at legislating or else ensure that priority is given to every local authority such that a wheelchair user or anyone with a disability has first priority.  Then we need to look at building.  Again, building is a major issue given that 17% of people with a disability are in social housing compared with 11% of the general population.  A total of 17% of people with a disability in Carlow live in social housing compared to 11% of the general population.  That really concerns me.  Moreover, people with disabilities are more than twice as likely to report discrimination in housing.  They are 1.6 times more likely to live in poor conditions.  These are important considerations when we are looking at providing good homes for good people.<\/p><p> I wish to ask a question of the National Disability Authority about something that concerns me.  What are the most important housing issues now that need to be addressed in the short term?<\/p><p> I want to speak about disability grants because that is a major issue.  There should be some sort of scheme whereby most houses have a wet room.  I find that, whether for people with disabilities or elderly people, we are fighting constantly to get grants.  A wet room in particular is so important.  People could be waiting for months and months.  People are lucky if they only have to wait for months.  People with a disability need to be prioritised.  These are simple things in life but, as the witnesses said, it is about quality of life.  Families have become so disheartened because we are not building in the right way and we find it difficult to get the grant money for them.  They are being forgotten.  Again, it is a matter of awareness.  What could the NDA do in the short term to ensure we prioritise people with disabilities and give them better access?<\/p><p> The biggest question I have is for both organisations.  Do the NDA and the Irish Wheelchair Association believe it would be beneficial to have a person with a disability on the board of every affordable housing agency in every planning department of our local authorities?  I believe that is where we are falling down.  I think every board should have it.  There should be one person with a disability on every board to do with housing.  Unless someone is in that position, they really do not know what it is like.  Unless we have someone from all the different agencies on all these boards, then I think we are not going to get the proper mix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#G00500","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1851,"content":"<p>I thank both organisations for their submissions.  I wish to acknowledge that we got other written submissions, including a submission from Independent Living Movement Ireland, which are useful to us.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge two people in particular for the record.  One is Ms Joan Carthy, who is present.  Joan has been remarkably effective in lobbying members of this committee, myself included, to ensure the issues that we are discussing formally stay on our radar.  It is important that we acknowledge that.  I wish to echo the comments of Senator Boyhan about Senator John Dolan.  His efforts not only individually but through the work he has done with his informal committee have ensured that the parties and some of us who many not otherwise have made the issue central to the work we are doing keep our focus.  I want to genuinely acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  One word no one has mentioned yet is \"discrimination\".  It is important that we name it.  People do not have to deliberately go out of their way to discriminate to allow a system to be in place that discriminates.  People with disabilities are among two or three groups who have always been disadvantaged in our housing system.  It is a form of institutional discrimination.  Those of us on the committee need to understand how to get over this problem.  It is not simply about a little extra money there or a little rule change here; it is about recognising the series of institutional barriers that have been in place for decades.  Unless we remove these in policy, legislation and funding, we will remain stuck in this problem.  That is not to accuse any official or Minister of intentionally going out of their way but by virtue of the fact that they allow the barriers to remain in place, the discrimination and extraordinary negative impact on the lives of people are perpetuated.<\/p> <p>  This committee looks at two things.  The first is housing and planning.  I will come back to that in a moment.  These hearings are not simply about having a nice conversation.  Our intention as a committee is to produce a report with clear recommendations to go to the Minister.  That is why it is really important, in the answers to the questions, that we focus on the key priorities to push the Minister on.  We can do a report and have a shopping list of 100 requests, but the longer the list of requests the less likely it is that Minister and the Department will respond.  If we focus sharply on the key things that, if done, would make a substantial difference, then I think our report could have an impact.<\/p> <p>  We are all constituency politicians.  It is not only about people with disabilities or wheelchair users and access to housing.  Along with Travellers, people with disabilities and wheelchair users are the people who spend longest in emergency accommodation.  When it comes to getting out of inappropriate private rental accommodation or getting into the private sector, as with Travellers, but for different reasons, wheelchair users and people with disabilities are more disadvantaged.  That is really important in terms of how we think about the recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The fact some of the recommendations from the Irish Wheelchair Association are so basic but the association still has to ask for them is astonishing.  The idea that we would not have in our housing needs assessment forms a box to tick to specify that the applicant is in need of accommodation suitable to live with a wheelchair is 1960s stuff.  Likewise, the idea that the housing delivery plans of local authorities do not have to assess the level of need for people with disabilities and wheelchairs in their administrative areas and five-year plans beggars belief.  The demands of the association are so minimal - I do not mean in any way to disparage what the association is asking for.  I would like to think that the five demands in the Irish Wheelchair Association form the absolute minimum that we ask for in our report.<\/p> <p>  While I absolutely support the 7% I want to make one caveat.  It takes approximately six years to get a transfer from one local authority property to another.  That is the position in South Dublin County Council.  In a sense the 7% figure should be the absolute minimum.  As the speakers know far better than committee members, the lifecycle changes.  A person might not need to be among the 7% of houses for the first ten, 20 or 30 years of a local authority tenancy.  However, when something changes, the person may have to go on a transfer list.  I acknowledge that some local authorities have a medical priority transfer list and it might take three years instead of six years - that is the waiting time in my local authority.  In a sense, we really need to move to exactly what the association representatives have said, that is, universal design whereby the core structure of all new houses are easily adaptable in future.<\/p><p>That just makes sense.  It cannot cost any more in real terms for the structural basis of the house to have those key adaptable features.  Obviously, the house must then be retrofitted to meet very specific needs and that involves an additional cost.  While 7% is a good target, universal design is what the committee should support, at the maximal end rather than the minimal end the Department often talks about.<\/p><p> County and city development plans are up for review.  Local authorities will all start their reviews in September.  In some senses the county and city development plans are absolutely key to meeting our guests' demands.  If through their plans local authorities make some of the things our guests are asking into mandatory planning requirements for both public and private sector housing stock, nobody will be able to get out of them.  They will become the norm.  We are having conversations at the Joint Committee on Climate Action on how to improve energy efficiency standards through building regulations and planning requirements.  I would like to hear our guests' views on how our report's recommendations to the Minister can best argue for the reviews of the county and city development plans to incorporate some of these considerations so that they simply become requirements.  That goes back to a point Senator Murnane O'Connor made, namely, that it is not just the design of the house, the local authority is also responsible for all other aspects of planning, including footpaths, roads and zebra crossings.  Do the witnesses have specific and tight recommendations on those things?<\/p><p> We obviously have a lot of old stock.  The adaptation grants are a perpetual source of dissatisfaction for people.  Firstly the application process is very onerous, whether for a local authority tenant or a private homeowner.  Even when an applicant is approved for the grant, the wait for the application can be up to three years.  I only speak for my own local authority.  Somebody who due to age or a change in life circumstances can no longer use the upstairs in his or her home spends nine to 12 months going though the application and approval process.  He or she is then approved.  In South Dublin County Council it can take two to three years for such a person to get the funding unless he or she is in the most acute circumstances.  I would like to the hear our guests' thoughts on how that plays out in other local authorities and what recommendations they have for it.<\/p><p> I would be interested to know if the National Disability Authority proactively supports and pushes central and local government to implement the recommendations in the Irish Wheelchair Association's report.  They seem eminently sensible and they are not the only requirements.  I would also like to ask our guests what three or four key demands they would recommend for our report.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has five.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#H00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1853,"content":"<p>I will start with the key demands because I think they cover a lot of the points that have been raised.  Some of the issues we see relate to housing planning.  I refer for example to decisions on the site of very small apartments.  One would question whether they would be habitable by many persons with disabilities given their different needs.  That applies particularly to persons with wheelchairs, but also concerns the wider needs of others.  We have always advised that there should be a universal design approach to that.  We have submitted guidance on how to approach it and we feel that it would make a significant difference if it could be addressed in the future because many large developments are being planned and invested in.  We gave the example of the approach taken by one local authority which set a target for the number of universal design homes.  As the Deputy noted, they can be designed in such a way that they can be easily and very cost-effectively adapted over time.  We are hearing from at least one local authority area that by effective design, a standard 100 sq. m three-bedroom house can be a really accessible home.  It does not represent a huge extra cost.  We also hear anecdotally that the cost of developing a universal design home is about &euro;4,500 more than the cost of an average home.  We are going to carry out a cost-benefit analysis exercise, but that is the information we are hearing anecdotally.  The long-term savings that can be derived from that by avoiding expensive relocation, alternative types of residential care and future retrofitting would very easily meet the increase in cost.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, a revision of Part M is urgently required and could provide the basis for making a lot of these requirements mandatory.  There are potential ways to incentivise the market, particularly developers.  Perhaps there could be a VAT measure to encourage more universal design developments.  As pointed out earlier, the plans coming forward are sometimes already so advanced that it is difficult to row back.<\/p> <p>  We believe that a lot could be done through disability impact assessments of rules, regulations, policies and programmes.  For example, we hear about cases where people have gone for affordable housing and taken out the loan, supported by the local authority, before acquiring a disability later in life.  They find that the clawback provision prevents them from moving to alternative accommodation.  Disability-proofing would involve looking at the rules in black and white and realising that they have a discriminatory effect on some people.<\/p> <p>  Promoting and enforcing a universal design approach is about the sustainability of communities.  It allows people to live within a community rather than an area where a group of homes for persons with disabilities or older persons is clustered together.  Universal design provides for that integrated approach.  It allows older persons to stay in their homes for longer instead of going into nursing care.  There are interesting examples of this.  We operated a joint project with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, namely, the homes for smart ageing universal design challenge.  The winning project looked at how an older person could remain living in a three-bedroom house, close to neighbours, services and facilities, by converting the upstairs area to a separate apartment.  This could accommodate somebody who needs housing while providing an opportunity for company, a bit of security and better use of accommodation.  The winning solution went on to be progressed and the Department is now funding five further projects on that.  There are lots of practical things we can do, but rather than big projects it is about rolling this approach out as some kind of national programme.<\/p> <p>  In the transport sector there are good examples of persons with disabilities on boards.  However it is important that there are effective means of engaging with persons with disabilities in design and planning.  There are housing and disability steering committees in each local authority.  We must consider how they could be more effective in their engagement, the action plans they devise and the targets in those plans.  I refer also to cross-agency work.  National strategies are in place but cross-departmental work must happen.  In the past, each Department had a sectoral plan outlining how it would progress issues for people with disabilities, inclusion, accessibility matters and other issues.  Within those plans Departments were obliged to outline how they would work collaboratively with other Departments and agencies on particular issues.  There are many ways to progress housing accessibility in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Barron"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1854,"content":"<p>I would like to come back to Senator Murnane O'Connor's comment.  She raised what is the gateway to a very important concern by referring to children with disabilities throughout the country.  They will have needs in the future.  Historically, the Irish Wheelchair Association was very aware of the huge under-representation of people with physical disabilities on the approved housing list.  In 2011, we had a national campaign on that and worked with local authorities to encourage people to think ahead and register their housing need with the local authorities.  Following that campaign there was an increase of more than 200% in the number of people who registered their needs with a local authority.  Given the number of adults out there we still feel there is huge under-representation on the approved housing list, not to mention the children who cannot apply at this point but will have a housing need in the future.<\/p><p>That must be considered in terms of our bigger vision for sustainable communities.  We are operating very much on a reactive basis at the moment going on the existing approved housing lists.  We look at who is next on the list and how long they are on it and meet the need from that perspective.  We will not have sustainable communities if the committee couples that with what I said earlier about the housing development of three-bed, semi-detached, two-storey houses with no wheelchair accessible house included among them and maps that around the country.  We will have exclusive communities and more of them.  That is not a society we want.  We must consider children and adults and unmet need.  I suggest that we step out of the immediate need and look sustainably into the coming decades to see where we want to go.  I repeat what I said earlier that we are not talking about exclusively wheelchair-accessible houses.  Reference was made earlier to the need to build them but before that we must focus on design.  That is the key to what we are talking about here.  We heard a lot about universal design, Irish Wheelchair Association standards and OT standards.  It is all about the person and different levels of need.  My perspective is that of a full-time wheelchair user.  Advance planning is required.<\/p><p> On whether it is beneficial to have someone with a disability on the boards, it is a bit like talking about one's neighbour when he or she is not there; it is easy.  I suggest when he or she is in front of one, one is more considered.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's observation earlier, it is a simple thing to have a person with a disability on any committee or board and it is always a good thing.<\/p><p> For those who have not seen it already, I extend an invitation to members of the committee who have not had the experience of living accommodation for people who are full-time wheelchair users in inappropriate accommodation.  We would be happy to co-ordinate visits to inappropriate and best practice housing developments.  We could talk until the cows come home, but it is when one gets the experience of people and how they live that it will impact.  I extend the invitation and I will leave it with the Chair to come back if there is an interest.  We would be happy to facilitate that.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s question was directed at the NDA, but I will respond from my experience of working with the housing and disability steering groups.  Honestly, the good intention is there.  Very often, I wonder if some of them are a complete waste of time in terms of outcomes.  One has travel expenses and time and people must come from all over the place, but I question what the outcomes are in a lot of cases.  There are great outcomes in some areas, but it is questionable in others.  From my experience, people do what they are required to do.  I would bring that back to the Minister and to the Department.  That is what people will target.  I am not so sure about going straight to the county development plans to review them.  What will go into them is what has to go into them from a policy perspective higher than the local authorities and back to the Department.<\/p><p> I will finish by bringing the Senator back to our recommendations on the 7% target and housing specification design.  I have an interesting practical point to make.  We built seven houses under CAS funding.  We had a site in Belmullet in Mayo.  We built seven wheelchair-accessible houses there which we opened in 2017.  They are fabulous houses.  They have afforded great independence to the tenants who are in them.  Some have started working since they moved into the house.  It would do one's heart good to hear the transformation in their lives.  One of the things that was a battle as we went along was the size and the extra cost of doing what was needed.  On one of my visits with a tenant I was in the main bedroom of the house which has a second small bedroom.  The size was reduced from the original size because the houses were too expensive and they were an extra cost to the Exchequer.  What they effectively might have said to some people is that they would remain single.  They would not get a double bed and they or others would not go around both sides of the bed.  It was about extras, not about living or independence.  There is good practice and bad practice.  We must agree a specification for the various types of housing - one bed, two bed and three bed - and accept the fact there is a requirement for a certain space, not extra space.  The houses must be designed to meet the needs of the person and it must be accepted that they cost more than standard housing.  I suggest that must be done at ministerial and departmental level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1856,"content":"<p>I extend a warm welcome to Senator Dolan and acknowledge the work he has done in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#K00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1857,"content":"<p>I am being embarrassed this morning.  I am delighted to be here.  I welcome the witnesses and, equally, the contributions of my three Oireachtas colleagues.  I am in and out of various committees on a regular basis and on this occasion every one of them brought not just an interest but knowledge, expertise and a commitment to the issue.  I understand that not everyone on an Oireachtas committee has a depth of information and expertise on a given issue but we had three master classes from Oireachtas colleagues this morning.  The synergy between what came from the witnesses and the committee members is rarely seen and I wish to underline it.  I understand that other members do not have in-depth knowledge.  It is not a veiled criticism of other colleagues.  This is a rare moment and I hope we will have more of them in various committees.  This is the third committee meeting I have attended this week.  I was at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on Tuesday and the Joint Committee on Health yesterday.  It is the first time I attended three committees in the one week.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association's pre-budget submission contains three recommendations for budget 2020.  It is interesting that housing is in the middle.  Assisted living is to one side of it and transport is to the other.  It is a picture of interlocking pieces that outline the support people need to be able to effectively live in the community.  One lives in a house to be part of a community.  Some people will need the assisted living supports for that and they will need adaptations in their accommodation.  It is all about not spending 24 hours a day, seven days a week in the house.  As I often say, it is about being out and about.<\/p> <p>  I have been involved with both organisations.  I was on the board of the NDA for a number of years when it commenced and I was an employee of the IWA for 20 years from 1980 to 2000.  The IWA has a magnificent track record in the D&aacute;il.  In the early 1970s it was raising the building regulations for housing, footpaths and a range of issues.  We did not get Part M until it was legislated for in the 1990s.  The mobility allowance is another initiative supported by the IWA.  In the mid-1960s, a man who is now long deceased, Liam Maguire, was a champion of driving and accommodation for people with disabilities.  The current benefits date back to the work he did in the 1960s.  He kicked off the movement to make air travel accessible.  They are part of the legacy of the organisation.  In other spaces, we think about the IWA as being a big service provider, but it has had a marvellous track record over 15 or more years in practical advocacy for people to be out and about and this is a lovely opportunity for me to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  The committee has another suite of hearings coming up and it will produce a report.  In many ways, Deputy &Oacute; Broin almost did a first draft of the foreword or introduction to the report.  Many of the points he mentioned are important.  I became aware of an issue that arose at the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport that fits very nicely with this whole area.<\/p><p>It published a report after meeting disabled organisations and so on.  One of its recommendations was for the Minister to appear before it every six months and respond to the overall list of recommendations, thereby keeping the issue alive and giving it traction.  That is an important element.<\/p><p> I was struck by another couple of elements that might go into the report.  The NDA mentioned the issue of demographics and the 20% increase in the number of people with disabilities within the next seven years.  We had better wake up.  The number of people with disabilities in local authority accommodation as a percentage of the population is 50% higher compared with the rest of the population.  Deprivation is a concern in that regard.  These issues need to be set out in the report.<\/p><p> Turning to the active involvement of other Departments, I undertook a piece of work last year with the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We examined interconnections in terms of job activation and so on.  There are 15 or 16 Departments, so please do not name them all, but will the witnesses name the two or, at most, three that need to pull together if we are to move this on more effectively?  Given the demographics involved in this issue specifically but also more broadly, and in light of the interconnectedness between that and the value for money of investments, we must view this in terms of investment in services as distinct from the micro cost of a square foot of space or whatever.<\/p><p> Rebuilding Ireland was launched in July 2016.  I cannot remember the page number, but halfway through there was a section on disability.  My analysis of it has been echoed by Mr. Cunningham, if I am interpreting his comments correctly.  Rebuilding Ireland was strong on processes, with this and that committee feeding into one another.  However, all I could see was officials putting documents in a wheelbarrow and taking them to one committee and then to a subcommittee of same.  Rebuilding Ireland was weak on what it was going to do.  The evidence to date has shown that not much has happened for people with disabilities in the past three years.  I was amazed that it did not even mention the number of people with disabilities - I believe it was 3,919 - enumerated in the local authorities' 2013 surveys of who was seeking housing.  To me, this looked like an attempt to solve the macro problem of housing and homelessness while avoiding dealing with people whom we know have had issues with housing for generations.  I would be interested in the witnesses' comments on this point.<\/p><p> Are we making progress?  If someone is earning the exact same amount that he or she earned five years ago, we cannot credibly tell that person that his or her income has not dropped.  Even if we did not include the issue of housing, the cost of living has increased.  There will be press releases about further investment of 10% or 15% on last year's amount for this, that and the other, but what is the witnesses' assessment?  Are we draining the swamp or are we falling back even if more funding is being provided?  I am thinking about the demographics, unmet needs and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#K00300","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1859,"content":"<p>The Deputy should ask his final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#L00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1860,"content":"<p>I will conclude on the grant waiting lists.  Marvellous things have happened in the past ten or 20 years in terms of kids being able to attend regular schools and being educated with their brothers and sisters, but most adaptation grant applications are from families that are trying to kick off family formation, pay high mortgages and rents, etc.  They are living in houses that are not adapted and do not have significant capacity to be easily adapted.  That is a fact of life.  As such, families join the waiting list but the income criteria and so on make it virtually impossible for such families to have houses in which their children can live and operate.  That is a vignette.<\/p> <p>  Regarding decongregation, there are a further 1,300-plus young people, that is, under 65 years of age, in nursing homes.  The HSE has accepted that some of them should not be there.  None of them should be, given that nursing homes are designed for people who, on average, are 80 years of age plus and who live just two years of their lives there.  Someone aged 60, 50, 40 or 30 years could be put in one of those homes.  What is being done to maximise independent living?<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee members for their work on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#L00300","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1861,"content":"<p>I call Ms Barron.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#L00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1862,"content":"<p>I apologise, as I meant to respond to the question on the grant scheme waiting list.  Clearly, there are issues with it.  Some of them are down to how agencies line up services, for example, lining up occupational therapists with the system.  Sometimes, it is about the level of understanding about disability and the different types of disability and need.  We do not deal with information queries, but they sometimes come our way.  We hear about cases where, for example, a child has autism and the housing authority has made a decision that does not understand the situation for the family or the child.  Instead, it is very black and white.  We produced some guidelines on autism, but they must be embedded in the system.  The processes and decisions to support that embedding must be examined.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the level of grant available.  Senator Dolan referred to the cost of living.  The cost of making adaptations has increased, particularly where the building of extensions is concerned.  Since the alternative costs are significantly higher, it would make more sense to review the level of the grant.  The timeframe involved should also be reviewed, as costs arise over an extended timeframe.  If a universal design approach could be applied under the grant scheme to the standards the works must achieve, it would have long-term benefits.  Where a local authority is undertaking upgrading works and repairs in various buildings, it should always apply a standard of universal design.  There might not be an immediate need in those properties, but it may become a need further down the road.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to identify and agree an increase in the availability of social housing for persons with disabilities.  As to whether there have been improvements under the national housing strategy, some good foundations are being put in place by way of practical guidelines and structures, but what is required is the next level, namely, the implementation of actions, the setting of targets, and accountability for the delivery of same.  Given that the housing strategy is coming to an end next year and the mid-term review is under way, there is an opportunity to look for something more concrete and ambitious.<\/p><p>It fits within the ambit of the existing strategies but there is something to deliver on the ground in that regard.<\/p><p> The Senator also asked about persons with disabilities in nursing homes who should not be there.  We are very aware of that.  It has to be factored in, particularly in respect of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but also in terms of their right to be part of the community and live full lives.  Within the next year, Ireland will be due to report on how it is progressing actions in respect of the UN convention and Article 19 is very much about independent living.  These are the issues on which progress will have to be demonstrated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1864,"content":"<p>On the grants scheme, I have a copy of the pre-budget submission that the Irish Wheelchair Association submitted for this year.  One item relates directly to the housing adaptation grant.  I just noticed yesterday that the fourth report on the implementation of the national housing strategy for people with disabilities cites expenditure on the grants as &euro;60 million.  While that sounds enormous, it actually averaged out at about &euro;6,000 per person.  A practical example of that is when the needs of one of our own tenants changed.  She had a profound physical disability and applied for the grant because she needed an extra bedroom built onto a small, one bedroom house.  After tendering and going out for a number of prices, the cost to complete the extension - an en suite bedroom and a bit of reconfiguration - was &euro;63,000.  The maximum grant was &euro;30,000.  Fortunately in that case, the person contributed the other &euro;30,000 which luckily came to her at that point in time.  That is my understanding.  Otherwise, it would not have gone ahead.  That is a typical example.<\/p> <p>  The grant is a figure that somebody set and stood back from.  It does not deal with the reality of life, the economy or the increasing costs that have been referred to again and again.  It is wonderful for the small adaptations in a house but for more substantial work, there needs to be serious consideration given to it.  The flexibility should be given to the local authorities to deal with it.  Expenditure is needed and the grant creates savings elsewhere.  These adaptations cut back on the requirement for personal assistance if someone has a house that meets their needs.  For example, someone could have a ceiling tracking hoist which would mean they would only need one personal assistant, PA, to support them as opposed to two.  It is a complex set-up.  It is a figures game but somebody has just turned the other way and is not looking at it.  How long are we going to continue with expenditure of &euro;60 million on the housing adaptation grant and not build houses that are wheelchair accessible in the first place?  A high degree of universal design could allow for simple adaptations over time.  If we look at sustainable communities, if we do some long-term planning and design these houses to a degree of specification, over time we will be reducing the requirement for the housing adaptation grant.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about what Departments come into play.  The obvious one is the Department of Health in terms of the funding of PAs and the protocols and all that.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform holds the purse strings.  Everyone needs to talk and realise there are verified costs here so that it is not a battle every time we go back to something.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was referred to earlier.  Going back to our pre-budget submission, personal assistants, housing and transport are obvious ones and I am sure there are others we can bring into the loop.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to 1,300 people inappropriately placed in nursing homes.  I referred to that earlier.  I would be encouraging that the unmet need for housing be recorded in order that we get a full picture.  Some local authorities are resisting a call from people to register their housing need to plan for the next five years or whatever, because they have such numbers as they are they do not want it to grow.  The Government does not want to see the numbers grow, it wants to see them coming down.  There is a lot of need there, including among people in nursing homes.  Many others are sleeping on couches or living in family homes with siblings, elderly parents and so on.  It is only a snapshot of a bigger number.  Going back to the housing design issue, there is room for creativity in terms of the models of housing.  There are many models that could lie in between that of a two-bed house with one person living in it with their PA, and that of a nursing home with 50 or 100 bedrooms.  For example, we could have two houses sharing a PA room so they can share the one PA at night on whom they can call.  There could be three or four houses sharing a PA room.  Instead of four separate PAs in four separate locations, or a nursing home, there could be a facility designed and funded and provided with assistive technology, which we have not mentioned today.  A short-term outlay would have long-term savings for the Exchequer.  There is a lot of creativity that can be brought into that loop to bring people out of nursing homes into set-ups that support them socially, emotionally and physically within a nice environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1865,"content":"<p>I have two questions.

That had a specific investment programme to support it.<\/p> <p>  I might come back on the other question about the Departments now as I did not answer it earlier.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is critical.  The focus in all Government Departments now is on financial sustainability.  Universal design provides a financially sustainable approach to housing across the board.  The whole area of housing in the community is about the development of the community as a whole, so the Departments with responsibility for community development have a key role.  I would include the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the context of supporting families, what happens in the community and holding units together.  There are many Departments with this in their remit.  Living in the community, good living arrangements and so on are also relevant.  I suspect that many Departments and agencies are involved to some degree.  Disability is part of everybody's agenda.  On living in the community, having access to a home and what that means even in terms of getting access to employment, for example, having a fixed address, they would all have relevant roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Barron"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1867,"content":"<p>I was just consulting my colleague, Ms Carthy.

However, we have been progressing in other areas, particularly in the design of goods, services and products.  We have been working with EU standard bodies and the ISO on standards and we are starting to see a buy-in to a universal design focus generally in manufacturing and goods.  A standard was launched in recent weeks which promotes and rewards anyone who signs up to a standard on universal design in producing goods and services.  We are starting to see support for universal design at international level, which is a helpful opening for adoption at local level.  Our role in the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design is to promote the adoption of standards by different bodies, voluntary and non-voluntary, and we engage with that proactively.  We often develop practical guidelines to support the implementation of those standards.  We have worked with the tourism sector, for example, and have developed a suite of guidelines called Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach.  We have designed universal design homes.  We have also developed a set of guidelines for homes for people with dementia in order that they can continue to live in their own homes.

I acknowledge the standards of the NDA and the different levels there.  I also acknowledge the standards and guidelines of occupational therapists and I present the Irish Wheelchair Association's best practice standards.  I emphasise, based on 60 years of experience that we are, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, a very practical organisation grounded in the experiences of people with disabilities.  Our standards are all required in order for someone to live independently, but they are only standards.  Part M only allows people to visit houses but not live in them.  In practice, that means someone can get into the house where possible, access the downstairs living room and the Part M toilet, which a person in a wheelchair may not fit into depending on the size of the chair.  God forbid someone would want to stay in that house or live in it, because Part M does not provide for that.  The UK building regulations have different levels of regulation, including wheelchair accessible housing.  Standards, as Ms Barron said, are not mandatory, which is the reason they need a complete overhaul.  Do we have to wait for that or do we get the Department to fast-track an agreed specification for wheelchair accessible housing, for instance?

That is compatible with the three levels we have built in to our universal design home guidelines.  Our home guidelines would be above both the UK standard and the new Part M in the UK.  A standard has been developed and many developers and agencies use the BS 8300 as a reference.  However, as learned colleagues have noted, the regulation is the mandatory part.

Her email handle is \"murphyinmotion\".<\/p> <p>  I also recall my mother's experience in having to retrofit her 1960s house.  There is no point denying that the combination of living with and working closely with someone with a disability changes one's mindset and how one thinks, because it does.  Ms Murphy had a huge role to play when she sat on the board of Wicklow County Tourism.  She brought a disabled perspective to the whole tourism industry in Wicklow and it is now feeding down into our tourism plan, which considers people with disabilities.  My mother is very proud of the home she lives in.  She now has to negotiate a wheelchair through narrow doors which is causing the paint to come off.  I know this is upsetting her but she will not show it.  Those are practical things and when one lives through them, it makes a difference in how one thinks.  I want to put that on record because people who do not live with these things do not routinely think of them.<\/p> <p>  As the owner of an old hotel built in the 1820s, which I have extended, I know the difference between trying to retrofit something and designing with disability in mind.<\/p><p>One accessible toilet could be put in the 1800s building or ten could put in for the same cost when designing with a new build in mind.  There was a figure of approximately &euro;4,500 to try to put into the design of a house some features that would make it more livable for a person with a disability.  What percentage of our housing stock has had to be adapted overall?  Would the &euro;4,500 be an extra burden or would it amount to a long-term saving in the context of the housing stock?  There are no two ways about it because designing a new build with these features makes the process much easier and cheaper, ultimately delivering a better result.<\/p><p> Mr. Cunningham stated that we should design 7% of our housing stock for people with disabilities and Ms Barron indicated that nearly 13% of people on lower incomes or the social housing list have such needs.  The private sector proportion is 8%.  Is the 7% figure too low?  Should we aim for a higher percentage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#N01500","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562194800,"counter":1884,"content":"<p>I was referring specifically to wheelchair users as opposed to people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1885,"content":"<p>That is fine..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070400002#O00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562194800,"counter":1886,"content":"<p>We had a session a couple of weeks back on retrofitting.

It may be worthwhile, in the context of the report, to look at making the same argument for a blended funding model to make it easier to access adaptation grants coupled with long-term low interest loans where the household does not have the means.
