My Department and the contractor have had a number of discussions in recent days, but, unfortunately, it has not been possible to agree an extension to the contract that would comply with public procurement regulations.  The welfare of the residents was at the centre of the discussions.  I assure the Deputy that the Reception and Integration Agency is acutely aware of the hardship caused for residents in potentially having to move centre before Christmas.  Residents at the centre were all formally informed by personal letter delivered last Friday morning, 12 October, that it had not proved possible to secure an extension of the contract to 30 June 2019 and that, unfortunately, the centre would close when the contract came to an end on 3 December.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of a wider scheme to seek additional accommodation for those in the international protection process, on 16 September my Department advertised a public procurement competition for premises within 40 km of Newbridge.  The contractor may submit the accommodation centre in question for inclusion in this competition if it chooses to do so.  In the light of the most recent developments, I have arranged to extend the closing date for the competitive process to 31 October.  I hope this will enable interested contractors to submit premises for inclusion in the tender process. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, we will continue to work with the residents of the Towers who are still in the international protection process in order to identify alternative accommodation within the accommodation portfolio of my Department.  The Department has commenced the process of identifying additional capacity, both by way of the public procurement competition referenced and an advertisement placed in the national press seeking expressions of interest in providing accommodation on an emergency basis for persons in the international protection process.  <\/p>  <p>  My aim is to limit, to the greatest extent possible, the disruption caused for families and residents relying on Dublin-based services.  We are examining whether this objective can be strengthened in contracts.  The Reception and Integration Agency is working on contingency plans to facilitate schoolgoing children to continue in their schools for the current school year.  Many Deputies from the constituency, including Deputy Fitzgerald and others, have contacted me about the matter.  The children are living in the centre in question.  However, the Reception and Integration Agency is constrained by the current demands on its accommodation and the absence of bed capacity within its system.  Considerable work has been done to support residents with status to move out of accommodation centres and provide permanent accommodation.  I have been in contact with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government about the implications of this and the wider issue of providing accommodation for persons who have been granted permission to remain in Ireland. These discussions are ongoing.  My Department also provides funding for NGOs to deal with accommodation issues affecting those who have been granted permission to remain, including the approximately 60 such persons affected in this instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700004#B00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1539769200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and acknowledge the work he is doing in this regard and that he has made himself available to discuss the matter with those of us who are Deputies for the constituency.

It is a matter for any contractor, including the contractor involved, to make a submission in response to the procurement process.  By the same token, it would be completely inappropriate for me to intervene in any way in that process, as the Deputy will understand.  In this instance the contractor sought a longer term extension that would not have been in compliance with procurement law which we could not breach by agreeing to the request.  The Reception and Integration Agency sought a short term extension to the contract to June 2019 to allow for a structured and orderly exit from the centre, taking schooling, etc. into account, but this was not acceptable to the contractor.  However, we and the RIA remains open to any approach or suggestion from the contractor.  The door has not by any means been closed.

He also deserves an apology for what he and his family had to endure for over a decade.<\/p>  <p>  Since the report was published, I have spoken with Sergeant McCabe and apologised on behalf of the State to him and his family for the manner in which he was treated over a number of years.  I will arrange to meet the sergeant in the near future to reiterate this apology to him in person.  I understand the Garda Commissioner has also been in touch with him and I welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the tribunal is, in many respects, a damning report that goes to the heart of how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na handles allegations of wrongdoing within the organisation.  It is a lengthy report which requires and deserves careful study.  Indeed, Mr. Justice Charleton says in his report that it is important to read it in its entirety to appreciate the sense of its overall findings.  I urge Members of the House to take that common sense advice on board and to read the report in its entirety, rather than be selective.<\/p>  <p>  My officials and I are currently examining the report to see what actions are required in the light of its contents and conclusions.  I expect others will do likewise.

Mr. Justice Charleton has reminded us of the obligations of the Garda, in particular: the obligation to be honest; to serve the people of Ireland; and to treat their obligation to the public as superior to any false sense that individual policemen and policewomen should stick up for each other.

Key among the controversial ones is the emphasis on structures, in particular, the moving away from the system that we were in the process of developing of external oversight initiated through the vehicle of the Policing Authority, albeit a vehicle which was not given sufficient legislative powers to really play that accountability role accurately, and replacing that with an internal governance body, which actually brings more power back internally inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This proposal is for a board which is similar to those which exist right across the public sector and can be supportive of the Garda Commissioner in managing the programme of change.<\/p> <p> This Oireachtas must take on board what the Charleton report said about the political response to tribunal reports in general.  We all know there can be heated debate and furore about the setting up of tribunals, but little or no considered debate when the reports are published.

To the best of our knowledge, no manufacturer to date has sought such licensing by gambling regulators in Ireland or in other EU member states.  If a game offers in-game purchases advertised to increase the chances of success in the game and does not fall within the current Irish legal definition of gambling, such purchases are essentially an e-commerce activity.

It is a whole-of-Government support system for those seeking international protection in Ireland.   However, I will assume that the Deputy is referring primarily to the accommodation centres provided by the Reception and Integration Agency of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the criticisms levelled at the system, particularly in terms of length of stay, it has proven effective in ensuring that those who come to our country seeking international protection receive food and shelter and have immediate access to these and other State services and supports.  More than 60,000 people, including many children, have been provided with shelter since its inception.  It is not possible to predict how many people seeking international protection will arrive in any given year.  It can vary substantially from year to year.  However, the system generally, with some recent small exceptions, ensures that all applicants, including children, are offered immediate shelter, full-board accommodation and a range of services such as health and education while their applications are being processed.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will give serious consideration to any alternative system that can provide immediate shelter and access to State services in the instance of the spontaneous arrival of families and children with unestablished needs who unexpectedly turn up in Ireland seeking protection.  To date, no alternative has been put forward, but I will continue to keep an open mind on the matter. <\/p> <p> The Deputy has asked about the number of children in care who are being looked after or living in direct provision accommodation.  At the end of August, there was a total of 1,591 children &ndash; 822 males and 769 females - in direct provision accommodation, all of whom reside with their parents or guardians.  Unaccompanied minors are the responsibility of Tusla.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, on 30 June this year, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, signed the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations to transpose the directive into national law.  The directive includes important provisions in regard to rights to gain access to health and education services, as well as in regard to children's rights and material reception conditions for applicants which include housing, food, clothing and a daily expense allowance which, as we know, has gone up.  This represents a major change in managing the reception conditions for those seeking international protection in Ireland.  I am pleased that the standards that must be reached in how we treat those seeking international protection are now underpinned by law.  Any replacement proposed for direct provision would have to meet all of these standards.  Significant improvements to the living conditions of applicants have been made in recent years.

I can think of one.  Offering immediately shelter, food and safety to children and their parents who come here is a challenge, but leaving them in direct provision accommodation for up to seven years is absolutely obscene.  There is an alternative to the system, namely, not having the meeting of the needs of the homeless compete with the meeting of the needs of those who come here seeking asylum.  The only reason they compete is the housing crisis, which involves a separate but not unrelated discussion.  The problem is that the parents of the children, many of whom have been in direct provision accommodation for up to seven years, are not given access to work.  We have seen the meat industry open its doors to allow new workers to come into the country.  There is an appeal from the care industry and the hospitality sector to do likewise.  Despite this, someone cannot apply for work if he or she has been here for less than nine months.  If someone's case is being appealed, he or she cannot apply.  This relates to a significant cohort of parents.<\/p>  <p>  Let me return to the circumstances of the children.  Let us recall how touched the entire country was by the story of the young woman who went on \"Morning Ireland\" having lived in a hotel for two years.

It means entire families would not have to share rooms with other families and that different genders would not have to share the same room.

The long stay in direct provision accommodation and the confined space have led to an increase in mental health problems and depression among the children.  Therefore, there are two concerns.

When necessary, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  I confirm the Government's commitment to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensuring the organisation is appropriately resourced.<\/p>  <p>  Garda recruitment was effectively discontinued from 2010 until 2014.  I am very pleased that 2,200 recruits have since been attested as members, of whom 57 have been assigned to the Kilkenny&ndash;Carlow division.

While I am glad that there has been an increase in the numbers, I contest that the Government sometimes underestimates the value of community garda&iacute; and their effectiveness in fighting crime, rural crime in particular.  The community garda is a confidant and trusted liaison between the man on the street and the man on the beat.  Members of the public are far more comfortable in relaying potentially sensitive and confidential information on a crime to a garda they know and trust.<\/p><p>It is important to have a garda operating in this capacity who knows the community and the people of the community.  The community garda can collect and convey vital crime-solving information to his or her colleagues.  The single greatest deterrent to crime is a well informed garda on the beat.  It is my firm belief that we should aim to have a community garda in every Garda station in the State.  That is the level of importance that I place on this crucial policing position.  Every parish in any part of Ireland, and in rural Ireland in particular, should have a community garda in place to fight the crime that we all know is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700010#H01700","speaker":"1368","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539773400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Deputy Aylward makes an important point.

That uncertainty is hugely worrying for all citizens on this island, but it is especially worrying and urgent for businesses across the island which are crucially dependent on certainty, especially on supply chains to the United Kingdom.  There is uncertainty about a hassle-free landbridge across the United Kingdom into markets in continental Europe and beyond.  Owing to the uncertainty businesses on this island are already losing contracts because they cannot ensure certainty in 2019 on their supply chain to the United Kingdom and beyond.

Our preference is still for an overall UK-EU relationship which would resolve all of the issues, but it remains essential that the agreement on the backstop be fully maintained because it provides certainty that there will be no hard border in any circumstance.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years we have had opportunities to debate and assess our position on contingencies, but the Government continues to work with our EU partners to secure the best deal possible.  In that regard, the budget announced last week provided significant additional funding for the preparations for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  A new &euro;300 million future growth loan scheme was provided for, in addition to the &euro;300 million Brexit working capital scheme.  We have increased the budget for InterTradeIreland by more than &euro;1 million.  We have also increased the budget for local enterprise offices across the country by &euro;5 million.  A cross-government awareness campaign is well under way and being led by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney; the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and others entitled, Getting Ireland Brexit Ready.  Events have taken place in Cork and Galway and further events are planned for this week and next in Monaghan and Dublin.  A considerable number of positive actions have been taken by the Government to ensure we can mitigate the consequences of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear: there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  It will be a difficult challenge, but in the next few days the focus must be on encouraging the parties to continue their negotiations to find a settlement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700012#K00600","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1539774000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I appreciate that all of those supports are in place, but what we and businesses need is certainty.

I again ask the Minister for his views on Ambassador O'Neill's remarks, in particular, that the British are backsliding on the Northern Ireland backstop and that their position is not consistent with what was agreed to.  Is that a shared Government position?  What is the Minister's instinct on the timeline?  He was involved in the early stages of the Brexit talks and is still involved from a security point of view.

I do not need to remind the Minister of the importance of this and of what is at stake at the heart of these negotiations.  In December last year the British Government signed up to an agreement that included the provision of a backstop aimed at avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and that would safeguard the Good Friday Agreement.  We know the backstop in and of itself did not fully provide the protections that were required but it was an important step forward and an acknowledgement of the unique circumstances that apply to our island, North and South.<\/p>  <p>  Since that agreement there has been, regrettably, no clarity on the legal text forthcoming in respect of the implementation of the backstop, despite assurances that it would be in place as of March of this year.  Instead, we have a British Government that is backsliding, has ignored deadlines, has avoided living up to its obligations and has shirked its responsibility.  The latest British Government proposal is for a time-limited backstop, which, in reality, would mean no backstop.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Government's dismissal of that proposal yesterday, but unfortunately the Tories' toxic deal with the DUP has undermined the progress that we should have made by now.  The DUP and the far right of the Tory Party have sought to undermine the agreement the British Government previously signed up to.  The DUP has moved from a position of not wanting a hard border to one of now seeking a hard border.  That is absolutely reckless.  It is an irresponsible position to take, but the reality is &ndash; we know as much in this House &ndash; that the DUP does not represent the majority of the people in the North, who voted to remain.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to defend the position of citizens in the North and across the island who want the best deal possible.  People want a frictionless border.  They want full protections for the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.  They want to be sure that the backstop is the bottom line and that it is the absolute minimum we will accept.  The T&aacute;naiste said on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning that the transition period could now be extended.  That proposal may have merit and we are open to that, but the crux of the matter is that time is running out in respect of delivery.  The Government has said it is not into deadlines.  I appreciate that, but there needs to be a deadline at some stage because there has to be ratification of this deal and that will not be a straightforward process.  Earlier this week, the European Parliament was clear when it said that it will not support the withdrawal agreement without a workable and legally operable backstop.  I welcome that statement.<\/p>  <p>  I am looking for insight that the Government and Ministers may have picked up yesterday in Luxembourg or this morning.  Does the Government expect any meaningful progress to occur at the European Council meeting this week?  Can the Minister for Justice and Equality outline to the D&aacute;il when the absolute deadline arises for a backstop to be agreed for the ratification process to take place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700013#L00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1539774600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I will neither impose deadlines from Dublin during a critical phase of the negotiations nor pre-empt what might happen over the next 48 hours.

They are satisfied with EU 27 solidarity towards Ireland and in respect of our key priorities, which have been made clear since the day the British voted to leave the European Union.  That solidarity remains totally in place and united.  For there to be a withdrawal agreement of any description there has to be an Irish backstop, as committed to by the UK in December and as repeated by the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, on several occasions since.  That backstop, as an insurance policy, will hopefully never be called upon to come into effect, but it cannot be temporary and it cannot have an end date.  As has already been committed by the UK, it must apply unless and until a future trade relationship is negotiated.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have the full support and backing of this House in the challenge that lies ahead for the UK, the European Union and for us here in Ireland as well.  I acknowledge the support of Sinn F&eacute;in but I have to say, a Cheann Comhairle, that Sinn F&eacute;in can do more.  It criticises the DUP as well as the disposition of the British Government and the relationship with the DUP.  Deputy Doherty and his party can do more work to ensure that there is a voice for Northern Ireland and that the decision on the part of the people - who voted to elect the Northern Assembly, which would consequently elect the Northern Executive - could be realised.  However, that did not happen because of intransigence on the part of the DUP and responsibilities being abdicated by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Therefore, it is a little rich for Sinn F&eacute;in to look to the Government and criticise the relationship between North and South when Sinn F&eacute;in has specific responsibilities, experience and, dare I say it, expertise in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700013#L00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1539774600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I advise the Minister to have a word with the T&aacute;naiste in respect of what is going on in the Northern Assembly because the T&aacute;naiste has addressed this House on numerous occasions in respect of the difficulties in the North.

He was kind enough to visit Garda stations where he listened attentively to the issues and concerns raised by  local garda&iacute; on the ground, including senior members of the Garda.  I very much appreciated that.  However, the position has worsened in respect of some of the issues we discussed with the Minister at that time.  Since taking up his position, the new Garda Commissioner has said that things cannot continue as they were.  For things to continue as they were, the Garda would need to have their existing resources maintained.  However, cuts in overtime have resulted in many areas in County Kerry having a non-existent service.  I know the Minister is not happy with that and does not want to stand over it.  Unfortunately, it has led to members of the force being injured during their work.  There have also been a number of assaults on garda&iacute;, both male and female, in County Kerry.  That is not acceptable, either in the past, present or future.  I want the public to be assured in that regard.  Whether it is from Valentia Island to Tarbert or from Ballyferriter to Gneeveguilla or Scartaglen, County Kerry is a massive county.  It is a beautiful county but it is massive, and it takes a great deal of resources to police it properly.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister may remember we discussed situations that arise at night when garda&iacute; are in a patrol car.  He fully understood the need to have three rather than two garda&iacute; in a Garda vehicle in such circumstances.  We asked him for that at the time but even two garda&iacute; in one car would be a luxury.  We were looking for three garda&iacute; as a necessity but now we realise it would be a luxury because many parts of the county do not have a Garda car with one garda in it, never mind three garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  Those are my concerns and those of the people on the ground.  As the Minister knows, unfortunately, drugs have become an issue in places where we never had a drug culture or a drug problem previously.  I remind him again that in late May or early June, we had a large public meeting in Cahirciveen in County Kerry, which was attended by hundreds of people and also senior garda&iacute;.  I appreciate and acknowledge their attendance.  They were kind enough to come and give of their time and answer all the questions asked of them at a public forum, which was very worthwhile.

Notwithstanding what Deputy Healy has said about unacceptable levels of unemployment in towns across south Tipperary, including Carrick-on-Suir, Cahir and Clonmel, I point out that there has been something of a favourable change in the live register figures for south Tipperary since 2012, where live register figures have dropped by over 50%.  It is important that Government policies for the regions continue to focus on regional development through the local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to ensure that people in the regions and in south Tipperary have an opportunity to live and work in areas they have chosen.

It is not a political decision to decide what drugs are prescribed, although I am not suggesting the Deputy is unaware of that.  It is a very prescribed process under the HSE and the drugs procurement agency, which both have a role to play.  As I understand it, we expect the senior team in the HSE to make a decision.  As the Deputy knows, it was not approved at the initial attempt.<\/p>  <p>  It is a difficult balance to get right when dealing with multibillion euro drug companies which are coming to the Government and effectively charging what they want.  We cannot say \"Yes\" because if we can get a better price for this drug, and if it is approved, then we can see so many more people treated.  As with any other drug, there are cost efficiencies and clinical evidence to be considered.  The process is at an acute stage.

I submitted it over the weekend on foot of Bord na gCon's threat to move a feature greyhound race from Mullingar greyhound stadium to Galway greyhound stadium.  The Irish Cesarewitch, a premier 600 yd classic, has been held successfully in Mullingar for the past 18 years and it appears that the threat to move it to Galway has since been rescinded.  I compliment the members of the board of the greyhound track, the breeders who use the track and my constituency colleague who in recent days have been highlighting the regrettable proposal that emanated last week.  I thank the Minister for taking a call over the weekend.  I wonder why the decision to move the race to Galway was not formally notified to the board of Mullingar greyhound stadium.  While it is most welcome that Bord na gCon has changed its mind in advance of tomorrow evening's meeting, at which the decision was due to be ratified, it raises questions about the governance of Bord na gCon.  Did someone in Galway put pressure on Bord na gCon to move the race in the first instance?  Did the decision to rescind the proposal to move the race to Galway result from the pressure exerted in recent days by the directors, the political representatives and the breeders?<\/p>  <p>  We were told that it was proposed to move the Cesarewitch to Galway because of capacity issues at Mullingar.  I consider this to be a very lame excuse because the capacity issues with the fire escape were definitely present last year and may have been present for the past two years when there was no proposal to move the race.  All of this shows Bord na gCon's clear lack of support for Mullingar greyhound stadium.  We know that Bord na gCon has invested in greyhound stadiums in regional locations such as Thurles, Clonmel, Galway and Tralee and wonder why Mullingar is not on that list.  In February 2017 Bord na gCon received Government approval to dispose of Harold's Cross greyhound stadium.  Part of the reason for that decision was the need to clear the substantial debts Bord na gCon had built up in the preceding years.  It was also intended that some of the money raised from the sale of the Harold's Cross facility would be used to invest in other stadiums.  We cannot interfere in the fire officer's decision and should not seek to do so because health and safety are paramount.<\/p><p>However, the board's lack of support for the directors of the Mullingar stadium making the necessary physical improvements is hampering the dog track's ability to reach its full potential.  Consequently, the stadium is losing revenue weekly.  The track is turning down highly profitable benefit nights and is no longer available to the sports clubs from surrounding counties that once travelled to use it.  I understand that Bord na gCon turned down a recent request for funding to replace the advertising board at the centre of the track, a further indication of its lack of support for the stadium.<\/p> <p> Bord na gCon is responsible for presenting a business case to the Government and the latter has representatives on the board.  When will funding be made available to carry out the essential capital works that will enable the stadium to generate its own revenue and put it on a sustainable footing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700020#X00300","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539779100,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for raising this issue.

I hope that the Bill will modernise the greyhound industry by underpinning it with legislation that is fit for purpose in the 21st century.  The Deputy mentioned a colleague.  I presume he meant Deputy Burke, who has also been in touch and made representations on this matter, including to the track's board directly.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na gCon is a commercial semi-State body established in 1958 under that year's Greyhound Industry Act, chiefly to control greyhound racing and improve and develop the greyhound industry.  It is a body corporate and separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  I have made inquiries with Bord na gCon and have been informed that, due to issues around attendance capacity at the Mullingar greyhound stadium owing to fire safety restrictions, the 2019 Irish Cesarewitch is proposed to be run in Galway over 575 yd.  The intention behind this proposal is to move the event to Galway temporarily.<\/p>  <p>  Approval of any significant capital project at individual stadia is subject to the completion of a systematic review of the industry footprint, as proposed in the IGB Strategic Plan 2018-2022.  I have been advised that the procurement process for appointment of an independent consultant to undertake this study will commence shortly, and it is anticipated that a final report will be completed by next March.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that, in the interim, it has engaged consultant architects to prepare a proposal to address the deficiencies at Mullingar and that this proposal will shortly be put forward for planning approval.  On receipt of same, it will be necessary to obtain fire safety and disability access certificates regarding the proposed works.  A sum of &euro;100,000 has been assigned for works under the board's business plan regarding the use of some of the surplus proceeds from the Harold's Cross sale.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity of the restaurant is limited to 126 people on the upper floor and 130 on the ground floor.  The suggested proposal involves the demolition of the existing fire exit at the southern end of the building and the construction of a new, larger fire exit staircase.  Subject to fire authority approval, this solution would increase capacity on the upper floor to 240, with ground floor capacity remaining unchanged, representing a net increase of 114 patrons.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that, at the national greyhound consultative forum meeting held on 26 September, it indicated that a review of the fixtures and events calendar was under way and submissions were invited in respect of that calendar.  The necessity to review the calendar was based on the changes in the industry in general and to provide for an optimum racing calendar throughout the year.  A number of detailed submissions were received.  These were considered by a sub-committee established to make recommendations to the board.  The sub-committee met on three occasions and gave detailed consideration to a range of factors which have an impact on the events calendar.  A draft calendar was formulated and put forward for consultation on 11 October.  Submissions were invited on it by 16 October so that the matter could be considered at the board meeting scheduled for 18 October, which is tomorrow.

It was the first opportunity for the Minister, Deputy McHugh, to address the house in his ministerial capacity, and I must say that I am disappointed that he has not shown up.  I am more disappointed for the schools that we will reference in this debate that he has not shown up for them.<\/p>  <p>  There are many challenges in the education sector in Donegal, for example, the three school campus projects and the schools building projects for Gaelscoil na gCeithre M&aacute;istr&iacute; in Donegal town and St. Mary's in Stranorlar, to name but a few.  There are many other challenges in terms of the pay and conditions of the staff who work within our school environments.<\/p><p>However, today I want to revisit an issue the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I have jointly addressed in the House numerous times, namely, the issue of DEIS schools and the failure to afford DEIS status to a number of schools in Donegal.  Last year, we raised the issue of four schools in particular, Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair, of which I was a pupil many years ago, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Ghort an Choirce, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Rann na Feirste, and Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Mh&iacute;n Tine D&eacute;.  Despite the fact that an additional 79 schools were added to the DEIS scheme last year, these four schools were not part of the complement awarded DEIS status.<\/p> <p> I will address with the Minister of State the issue of some of those schools.  It is of note that all the national schools in the parish of Gaoth Dobhair have DEIS status.  When children advance to second level in Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair, however, they lose the advantage of attending a school with DEIS status.  The reason that is the case is due to the educational attainment of the students as a result of the professionalism of the staff in that school who have supported students to achieve their best.  They are being punished because of their success in that respect.  Notwithstanding that, the pupils who enter that school every morning at a few minutes past nine come from a disadvantaged area.  The 2016 census indicates the area is now more disadvantaged that it was in 2011.<\/p> <p> Gort an Choirce national school has not secured disadvantaged status, despite the fact that the secondary school in the area, Pobalscoil Chloich Cheannfhaola, has disadvantaged status.  The area of Gort an Choirce is disadvantaged.  The index score from the 2016 census shows that levels of disadvantage in the area increased dramatically between 2011 and 2016.  The school in Rann na Feirste is in a similar position, as is the school in M&iacute;n Tine D&eacute;.<\/p> <p> When we raised this issue last year - I raised it again earlier this year - we were told by the Minister that a review of all schools would be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018.  We were also told it would take account of the updated census data, which I have just cited showing that the areas in which these schools are located have become more disadvantaged than they were previously.  Account was to be taken of the new data and we were told a decision would be made as soon as possible. <\/p> <p> Children have been back in school since September and their schools still do not have the supports that should be in place for children attending schools in disadvantaged areas.  Such supports include additional resources, school meals programmes and additional teaching capacity to make sure that all the challenges the children face are addressed in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p> If the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, had shown the decency to turn up in the Chamber, I would have taken the opportunity to congratulate him, his family and our county on his elevation to the position of Minister.  However, that also involves turning up and delivering.  I have a question for the new Minister.  When will these four schools be awarded DEIS status?  It is blindingly obvious that they are entitled to and should be awarded DEIS status and ridiculous we have had to wait this long.  Children are not meeting their full potential because of the degree of red tape within the Department of Education of Skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700021#Y00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539779700,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh.  I am delighted he has been appointed to that office.  I take this opportunity in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to wish him the very best.<\/p>  <p>  I was a school principal for 31 years and I understand what Deputy Pearse Doherty is saying.  I have taught thousands of children and in my ministerial role I always put the child at the epicentre of any agenda I have.  Therefore, I hear what he is saying.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of the Government to address educational disadvantage at school level.  The DEIS plan 2017 sets out the vision for future interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy and builds on what has already been achieved by schools which have benefited from the additional supports available under the initial DEIS programme introduced in 2005.  The DEIS plan 2017 is based on the findings of an extensive review of the DEIS programme, which involved consultations with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  There are two key elements to the 2017 pIan.  The first is the development of a new identification process for the assessment of schools in terms of the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data, including the Department of Education and Skills primary and post-primary online databases and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, small area of population statistics from the national census of population 2011, as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index.  The second is the updating of the DEIS school programme, which represents the overall package of supports available to schools participating in the programme to improve educational outcomes for pupils at greatest risk of not reaching their full potential by virtue of their socio-economic circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  As of September 2017 following the application of the new identification process, 79 additional schools were designated as DEIS and 30 urban post-primary schools were upgraded from DEIS band 2 to DEIS band 1.  These were schools that were identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The DEIS plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme, but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This is turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.<\/p>  <p>  Work is continuing on the implementation of the various actions under the DEIS plan 2017, with a focus on targeting extra resources as closely as possible at those students with the greatest level of need.  Work has also commenced on identifying such interventions that are having the greatest impact on tackling educational disadvantage.  This will involve testing new approaches in groups of schools and working closely with schools in school self-evaluation and planning improvements.<\/p>  <p>  We need to ensure the current identification model is as accurate as possible and this requires the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses.  Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  To ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, the Department has decided to conduct additional quality assurance on the model before extending these envisaged uses of the model.  It is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700022#Z00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1539779700,"counter":247,"content":"<p>This is new information, which the House has not been given previously.  We were told something very different, namely, that there would be an update of all schools using the 2016 census data.  The Department is still using the 2011 census data, which is already seven years out of date.  As I said, all of these areas have become more disadvantaged, according to the HP deprivation index.  The schools, which are in disadvantaged areas, should have been awarded DEIS status in the first instance.  They have since become more disadvantaged.  It appears the Department has been reviewing the programme it is running to categorise whether a school should be in the scheme or not for the past year.  In the meantime, students and teachers have to wait and potential outcomes will not be reached.  The Minister of State is shaking her head.<\/p><p>We were told last year that an update of the associated HP index was recently published and that the timeline for the process of assessment to be completed was the end of the first quarter of 2018.  We are now in the third quarter and about to enter the fourth quarter of 2018 and the process is still not complete.  Now the Minister of State, on behalf of the new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, is telling me and telling the students of Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Ghort an Choirce, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Rann na Feirste and Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Mh&iacute;n Tine D&eacute;, as well as the other schools that should be afforded DEIS status, that it is not intended to extend the scheme to any further schools until quality assurance work on the model is complete.  When did this start?  Last year we were told that work would be done on this and a full year has passed.  When will these students get certainty?  When will the Department recognise that their areas have fallen into more disadvantage and therefore their schools, and through their schools the students themselves, need to be supported in the way that many other hundreds of schools have been supported through the DEIS programme.  That is the key question that parents, pupils and teachers are asking.  The Minister of State has a background as an educator and will understand that the teachers concerned at both primary and secondary level are tearing their hair out because they recognise where their pupils are coming from, understand they are from disadvantaged areas and cannot understand the red tape exercise that has been going on in the Department for over a year that is preventing them and their pupils from getting what they should have been given in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700022#Z00300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539780300,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and hear him clearly but I point out that the 2019 budget saw the largest Vote ever for education of &euro;10.8 billion.

As I said earlier, the underlying principle for inclusion in the DEIS school programme is evidenced by the need to make provision of key supports to schools catering for very concentrated levels of disadvantaged pupils.

I note that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has other commitments and is unavailable today and I thank her office for contacting me to inform me of that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that the domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment to the carer of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care, attention and supervision substantially in excess of that needed by another child of the same age who does not have a disability.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to get on with the activities of daily living.  The allowance is a great help to parents and enables them to help their child and pay for some of the additional costs incurred due to the child's disability.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the parliamentary question that I submitted last week, the Minister stated that for domiciliary care allowance to be payable, a child must be resident with the qualified person for at least five days per week and that there is no provision under the legislation to support the splitting of the domiciliary care allowance between two parents.  I appreciate that, as with every scheme, there are objective guidelines for determining eligibility.  Until two weeks ago, however, I was not aware of an issue that baffles me, quite honestly.  To refuse this payment to the carers of a child with disabilities because he or she spends half of the week with one parent and the second half with the other parent is discriminatory.  There are many such cases in this country because marriages break down for many reasons and it is not for us to ask why.  Having a child with disabilities has massive financial implications for any household.  There are cases where a judge rules that parents be given joint custody of a child or children.  In those cases, one or other of the parents gets the domiciliary care allowance but it should be split between both parents.<\/p>  <p>  Under the domiciliary allowance scheme, payment is not payable if the child is resident full time in an institution.  However, if the child comes home for not less than two days and for more than four days in any one week, a half-rate payment can be made to the qualified person.  Given that, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to split the allowance between two parents in cases of separation, which would be of major help to both.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate Fianna F&aacute;il's call for medical cards to be provided for all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  More than 33,000 parents are in receipt of this allowance on behalf of their children but currently there are approximately 10,000 children whose parents are in receipt of the allowance who do not have a full medical card.  Their parents are paying for medical care that is not covered by this scheme.  Extending the medical card to these children would remove a significant financial burden on their parents, particularly those children with disabilities and serious conditions.  It is imperative that we ensure that those experiencing financial hardship due to very serious illnesses receive a discretionary medical card and it is regrettable that this has not happened to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700023#AA00900","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1539780300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising this very important issue.  I accept that he has made some very valid points.  I will give the Deputy the detailed response from the Department and will answer any further questions he may have then.<\/p><p>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a payment made in respect of a child with a disability who requires care and attention substantially in excess of another child of the same age without a disability.  Eligibility for the allowance is not based on the child&rsquo;s disability but on the resultant additional care needs.  No disability excludes a child from qualifying but neither does a particular disability automatically qualify a child.<\/p><p>DCA is currently paid to over 38,000 parents or guardians in respect of over 42,000 children at a cost in excess of &euro;213 million per annum, when the cost of the associated carer's support grant is included.  DCA was first introduced by the Minister for Health in 1973.  The payment was specifically designed to help parents or guardians of severely disabled children between two and 16 years of age who were being cared for at home.  To qualify, the child had to have a severe disability requiring constant care and attention substantially in excess of that needed by a child of the same age, which was likely to last for at least 12 months.  In 2000, the scheme was reformed and was extended to include children under two years of age.  The scheme transferred to the Department of Social Protection in 2009.  The scheme is not means tested and is paid at the rate of &euro;309.50 per month.  The carer&rsquo;s support grant of &euro;1,700, is also automatically payable to all DCA recipients in June each year.  Some 60% of DCA recipients are also in receipt of the carer's allowance.<\/p><p>  Claim volumes have been increasing over recent years.  In 2017 over 8,000 applications were received, 763 more than in 2016 and 1,012 more than 2015.  Following the full application process, that is, the initial application, the provision of further medical information by the applicant, revised decisions and appeals, over 80% of applications are allowed.<\/p><p>Applications are normally decided within ten weeks.  Children who qualify for the allowance also qualify automatically for a medical card.  Domiciliary care allowance is payable to whoever is considered to be the qualified person to receive the allowance.  Section 186D of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 defines a qualified person as the person with whom the child normally resides and who cares for him or her.  In order for domiciliary care allowance to be payable, a child must be resident with the qualified person for at least five days per week as per section 140C of SI 162 of 2009.  The rationale for this condition - this touches on the point raised by the Deputy - is to ensure the payment is made to the person who is the main carer of the child and with whom he or she is considered to reside.  There is no provision under the legislation to support the splitting of the domiciliary care allowance payment between two parents.<\/p> <p> Domiciliary care allowance is a payment made in respect of the care of a child and can be taken into account when parents are agreeing maintenance or other arrangements for the care of the child.  While it remains payable to one parent only, the amount paid can be considered as part of the overall care package for the support of the child.  Therein lies part of the solution.  <\/p> <p> I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy, but I am listening on the broader issue because I take the points made by the Deputy in his introductory speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700023#AA01000","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539780900,"counter":259,"content":"<p>There are major financial implications in having a child with severe disabilities in a household.

In cases in which judges have decided joint custody is best for the child, nobody receives the domiciliary care allowance because the child spends half of the week with one parent and the other half with the other.

That is another reason we pushed in the Estimates debate for an increase in the weekly rate of carer's allowance, carer's benefit, blind pension, disability allowance and invalidity pension because we accept the argument - the Deputy's argument - that the parents of children with disabilities need more support.  <\/p>  <p>  On the broader debate, the legislation in place requires a child to be resident with one parent for five days per week in order to qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  It is important to note that under the legislation, where parents insist on a child residing fewer than five days per week with one or other parent, the allowance is not payable.  Is there a possibility that such families, as part of the separation agreement, could negotiate a settlement in that regard?  If a child is resident full time in an institution such as a hospital, the domiciliary care allowance is not payable.  If, however, the child goes home for not fewer than two days or not more than four in any one week, half of the allowance is paid to the qualified person, that is, the person with whom the child is considered to be normally residing, if not in the institution. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised a very important issue which I will follow up with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection because the argument he has made has a certain validity.  We must ensure that if there are two parents providing care on a 50:50 basis, there will be some scheme in place.  In the meantime, while we are having the debate about legislation or changing the system, I encourage parents who are making settlements and if they are responsible and care about their children, to sit down and hammer out a deal to go 50:50 on the allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700024#BB00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Road Traffic (Quads and Scramblers) (Amendment) Bill 2017: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1539780900,"counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700024#BB00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1539780900,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I think we can all agree that in recent years the use of quad bikes and scramblers has become not just a nuisance but also a real danger to ordinary people who use public spaces such as parks and even when just walking through their own housing estate.  Without exaggeration, it is a major problem that is particularly prevalent in urban areas and one about which I hear increasingly when I meet people from my constituency and elsewhere and the Garda seems to be powerless to stop it.  At safety forum and joint policing committee meetings and community events, with residents, I have repeatedly raised the issue.  People have a real fear in taking their children to the park to play ball, walking their dog or even just going to the local shop because of the activities engaged in by those who use quad bikes and scramblers.  We have just had one of the hottest summers on record when people took advantage of the good weather, as did those who own quad bikes and scramblers.  How can any family with children relax when there is the real possibility and fear of being injured by such vehicles?  Quad bikes and scramblers have caused a number of fatalities and serious injuries.  The most recent and shocking example was when Ilabek Avetian received serious head injuries in Darndale Park when a scrambler landed on him while he was sunbathing.  This innocent man is now in a vegetative state in hospital.  His wife, Anzhela, was also injured in the incident when she suffered a broken pelvis.  Her life has been turned upside down and she is facing the real prospect of being made homeless while caring for her seriously injured husband because she has no income to pay the rent or on which even to live.<\/p><p>Communities believe they are effectively being terrorised by those who use quad bikes and scramblers in public places, especially local parks.  Such vehicles are repeatedly being used by some to damage property and football pitches and even to threaten people, while also engaging in other anti-social activity.  It is every parent's nightmare that the next casualty will be their child run down while playing in a public space.  Families and communities should be able to enjoy a public amenity during the week or at the weekend without having to fear for their safety.  It is hard to believe I have been raising this issue since I was a Dublin City councillor years ago.  It is disheartening to think the problems and issues have multiplied.<\/p><p>Shockingly, quad bikes and scramblers are readily available and cheap to buy.  A casual search on <i>DoneDeal.ie<\/i>today showed that a person could buy a quad bike for as little as &euro;180 and a scrambler for as little as &euro;200.  One can even buy a child's mini scrambler for &euro;300 or less.  Who would buy a child such a bike that could pose a danger, not only to the child but also to the general public?  With Christmas around the corner, I appeal to parents not to buy mini bikes, quad bikes or scramblers for their children.<\/p><p>The Road Traffic Act 2004 makes it an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a person under 16 years of age, including as a loan or a gift.  That does not seem to deter many people as I have seen myself that many of those who are riding such vehicles around parks and estates can be as young as six or seven years of age.  Last year, Deputy Imelda Munster, Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for transport, and I submitted a Bill to amend the Road Traffic Act 1994, which would allow garda&iacute; to deal effectively with quad and scrambler users who continue to flout the rules of the road and who do not have a licence, insurance or the vehicle registered in any way.<\/p> <p> Currently the law prohibits the use of these vehicles on public roads unless fully insured and taxed.  However, there is a clear gap in the legislation allowing people who use these vehicles for antisocial behaviour to get around the limited powers garda&iacute; have and avoid any penalties.  Under current legislation garda&iacute; have found it difficult to deal with the use of quads and scramblers in public places from an enforcement perspective.  Crucially, garda&iacute; have limited power to seize and keep vehicles engaged in the sort of antisocial activity I have described.  Housing estates, greens and parks are not considered public space under current legislation and this is clearly an anomaly in the law that needs to be corrected in legislation.  The law as it stands now means that many vehicles seized by garda&iacute; in public spaces are returned to the registered owners with little or no sanction on the owners because current legislation does not consider these areas as public spaces.  Therefore those who ride their quads and scramblers in such areas are not in breach of the law.<\/p> <p> This Bill, which Deputy Munster and I introduced last year, will extend the powers the garda&iacute; have to include public spaces.  The Bill will address the definition of public space, giving garda&iacute; power to deal with vehicles being used in such a manner.  This Bill is designed to correct anomalies.  There is clearly something missing in the definition of public spaces.  I hope that the Minister, the Government and others in this House will support us.  The indicators are different.  I feel that we need support with this.  I have been at safety forums and policing forums where garda&iacute;, including senior garda&iacute;, have indicated that there is a major problem.  I know the Minister has indicated that he will oppose this and I have heard his excuse.  I feel that this needs to be looked at.  I offer a hand to say that if the Minister lets this go to Committee Stage, we will look at whatever he has to say, whether amendments or other suggestions, and take them on board.  I do the same for his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  I hope he will think about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700024#BB00500","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539781500,"counter":264,"content":"<p>This Bill will amend the Road Traffic Act 1994.  It will correct an anomaly in road traffic legislation to allow garda&iacute; to deal with those who operate quad and scrambler bikes illegally.  This is a serious problem in many urban areas.  It is certainly an issue in my constituency and my town, Drogheda.  It is dangerous and frightening for local residents and for those operating the vehicles, many of whom are minors.  This Bill is not against scramblers or quads or those who operate them.  It is not an attack on any legitimate road user.  It is a road safety measure that has the potential to bring enormous benefits to communities affected by this problem.<\/p><p>In some urban areas we have a situation where people, many of them underage, are operating quads and scramblers illegally.  They are being driven without a licence, insurance or registration.  In many cases these vehicles are being driven dangerously, damaging property, injuring other road users and causing havoc in local communities.  Currently, the use of all terrain vehicles, ATVs, on public roads is prohibited by law unless the vehicle is fully insured, taxed and meets all other regulatory requirements.  There is a legal loophole which means the garda&iacute; cannot take action if these vehicles are operated in residential greens and public parks as these are not currently defined in law as public spaces.  This has led to a situation where people are engaging in antisocial and dangerous behaviour in residential areas.  The Bill aims to rectify this.  We are filling the gap to redefine &quot;public space&quot; to ensure that garda&iacute; can take action when people are driving recklessly, no more and no less.  We think this is a practical solution to the problem and we hope that other parties and the Government will support it.<\/p><p>There is a significant amount of regulation in the area of road traffic legislation.  However, it remains a problem.  Garda&iacute; have said that they seriously struggle to manage this issue in public greens and parks, finding the existing laws very difficult to enforce.  Garda&iacute; simply do not have the power to confiscate and detain ATVs that are operated illegally in public spaces.  The Government has said on many occasions that garda&iacute; have this power but local community and safety forums, the garda&iacute; and others have contradicted this.  They say that garda&iacute; cannot currently stop people operating quads on housing estates and in parks as these areas are not strictly defined in legislation as public property or public roads.  When garda&iacute; seize these vehicles, they have to return them to their owners without sanctioning the driver or the owner as they are technically not in breach of the law, as the greens and parks they are driving on are not covered in legislation.<\/p><p>In December 2016, then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, seemed to acknowledge the difficulty, saying:<\/p><blockquote>Despite the legislative provisions in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective.  Garda members are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers, etc. owing to the inherent safety issues involved and the risk of serious injury or death.  Therefore the opportunity to actually bring these vehicles to a stop is rare.<\/blockquote><p>That is a remarkable statement.  Does that mean garda&iacute; are no longer able to pursue or chase people who have broken the law?  The Government is clearly grasping at straws looking for reasons to oppose this legislation.  This Bill includes these areas under the definition of &quot;public space&quot;, thus giving the garda&iacute; the power to take action to deal with this illegal and dangerous activity.  If this Bill is successful, it means that garda&iacute; will be able to impound those vehicles.  The Minister knows it is a problem.  People are living in fear in some housing estates because of the antisocial behaviour and dangerous driving of these ATVs.<\/p><p>I have been raising this issue since I was elected and my colleague Deputy Ellis has been raising it for many years.  It is almost a year and a half, as Deputy Ellis said, since we introduced the Bill.  The problem remains.  It is getting much worse in some areas.  Between 2015 and 2017, 189 people were injured by these vehicles.  These figures do not take into account those injured this year.  The urgency of this issue was made loud and clear this summer when a man and his wife were run over by a scrambler when they were sunbathing in a park in Darndale.  The woman had injuries.  Her husband suffered catastrophic head injuries.  His doctors said he suffered &quot;severe traumatic brain injury&quot; and his injuries are understood to be life-changing.  His wife has said that their lives have been ruined.  His wife has also said that there is no law prohibiting the use of scrambler bikes in a public park and she wants to see this changed.  How long will the Minister ignore this for?  We need to step up.  We cannot risk another tragedy.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, said that he will oppose the Bill in case there are unintended consequences.  We requested a note from his office to explain these consequences and we received it about an hour ago.  The note we received says the Bill will potentially affect intoxicated driving cases.<\/p><p>We have all known for years that thousands of people get away with road traffic offences because the legislation is a patchwork of Acts going back to the 1960s and, as a result, it is full of loopholes.  The legislation must be consolidated to close those loopholes.  That is the job of the Minister.  I have been asking him to do that for the past two years.  It is the Minister's job and he does not need expensive consultants to do it.  He should make sure the expertise is within his Department.<\/p> <p> The note also says that if our Bill passed it would risk increasing road traffic fatalities.  That is an outrageous conclusion to draw.  If the Department wants to reduce fatalities on the roads, it should consolidate road traffic legislation to make it easier to convict people and it should invest in the traffic corps.  It is as simple as that, and the Minister is aware of that.<\/p> <p> The Minister has also said that a multi-pronged approach is being looked at.  The former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, however, said the same thing in 2016, two years ago.  An example of that approach, given by the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, was \"engineering solutions\" such as enhanced fencing and bike gates.  That is not a solution.  It will not work in open green spaces in residential areas.  The Minister knows that fine well.  Is he proposing to enclose entire green spaces in residential areas to stop quad bikes?  That is ridiculous and the Minister knows that is the case.  The solution is in the Bill but the Minister refuses to support it.<\/p> <p> The Minister has ignored many things in his portfolio and I implore him not to let this be another one.  I sincerely hope that Fianna F&aacute;il will support this legislation.  There is no concern about this Bill that could not be addressed on Committee Stage.  We have repeatedly said we will work with other parties that are willing to get this Bill through.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il does not take the cowardly approach and abstain or, worse, vote against the Bill.  That would show the party is out of touch with the public and their concerns about antisocial and reckless driving on public spaces and greens.<\/p> <p> Last week Fianna F&aacute;il issued a press statement asking what the point was of the Minister, Deputy Ross.  If Fianna F&aacute;il abstains or votes against the Bill, the same question could be asked of it.  As Members are aware, this is a growing problem in many towns across the State.  Christmas is coming, which means we will see more scramblers and quad bikes showing up in urban areas.  Every year the problem gets worse.  We have laws to deal with it, but they cannot be enforced in some areas because of the legislative anomaly.  I urge the Minister to support the Bill today.  If there are minor issues that require change, we can do that on Committee Stage, but it is most important to those affected that this matter is addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700025#CC00200","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539782100,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that this Bill has been brought to the House.  It is only appropriate that I should acknowledge the sentiments behind it because I support most of what has been said by the proposers, as does the Government.  I acknowledge both the role Deputy Ellis has played for a long period in pioneering this legislation and the sentiments behind it.  I share those sentiments.  I fully support what Deputy Ellis is trying to do.  The passion with which he spoke today and when I met him last night is not lost on anyone involved in promoting the legislation and trying to outlaw the activities he outlined.<\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge what Deputy Munster said.  I agree that this is a real and urgent problem that must be addressed.  I and others have identified that this is something that must be tackled by the Government.  That said, I do not retreat in the face of anybody who says that we have avoided difficulties on issues of road safety and the safety of lives.  That is a top priority of mine, the Department and anyone involved in the transport portfolio.  Road safety and the saving of lives must come first because that is what it is all about.  It is unfair of Deputy Munster to say that we have not been addressing those issues adequately.  She knows full well that the road safety legislation, which thankfully Sinn F&eacute;in supported and for which we are very grateful, has changed the atmosphere and I hope will save more lives.  Road deaths were down last year because it is a Government priority and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has been running some very effective campaigns.  It is too early to say whether the numbers will be down this year again but I hope that will be the case.  As of today, they are down by six.  That is not adequate.  Nothing is adequate, but the problem is being addressed with the same passion with which Deputy Ellis addressed this issue.  I support him.  The only problem we have here is the way of addressing it, which could perhaps have been tackled earlier given that the Bill has been in the legislative lottery process for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700026#DD00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1539782100,"counter":267,"content":"<p>It has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700026#DD00300","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1539782100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I am happy to concede that one looks on these issues differently when one gets into government because one has to look at the legalities of things rather than the objectives and the route which one will take there.  We are on the same journey.  I suggest Deputy Ellis is taking the wrong route because of the difficulties to which the wording would give rise.  Having studied the Bill, the conclusion is that it is not a matter for road traffic legislation but it is something that is being addressed elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in's contribution and if I can do anything to arrange a meeting of minds on the issue in the near future, I will do so.  I would be happy to do that because we want to pursue the same objectives, see lives saved and address the scourge of illegal activities by those who use quads and scramblers in the manner outlined.<\/p>  <p>  In the light of the serious injuries received by a man caused by a scrambler bike in a park in north Dublin in June of this year, and because of other incidents concerning such vehicles, it is critically important that we all redouble our efforts, including an examination of the powers available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under public order and criminal justice legislation.  It is not appropriate, however, to tackle this issue by changing the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in the Road Traffic Acts or in part of the Road Traffic Acts.  The Private Members' Bill seeks to expand the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; for the purposes of section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 to include any outdoor area, including public parks, to which members of the public have or are permitted to have access, whether as of right or as a trespasser or otherwise, and which is used for public recreational purposes.  The definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is central to the application of road traffic legislation, particularly in the area of intoxicated driving.  An amendment such as that proposed puts that definition at significant risk.  The consequences of that would be very serious.  The definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in current road traffic legislation has been the subject of many legal challenges to intoxicated driving prosecutions.  That has resulted in the current legal definition being robust and widely accepted in terms of the enforcement and subsequent prosecution of road traffic legislation.  Such enforcement has been a significant contributor to saving lives on our roads, with 2017 being the year with the lowest number of fatalities since records began.  Rather than risk increasing road traffic fatalities and undermining the current acceptance of the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in road traffic legislation, the issue of inappropriate use of scramblers in publicly owned parks or spaces would be more properly dealt with under public order and criminal justice legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, earlier this year, the Department of Justice and Equality convened meetings with key Departments and agencies on the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes, and a multi-agency task force was established, including representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the local authorities and other bodies concerned.  As part of the work of the interagency group, the Department of Justice and Equality is reviewing criminal justice and public order legislation to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na possesses the necessary powers to deal with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in public places other than those covered in the Road Traffic Acts.  The Department of Justice and Equality has sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General on quads and scrambler bikes, in particular concerning a number of provisions contained in public order legislation.  That will determine whether any legislative amendments are necessary to criminal justice and public order legislation to assist in curbing antisocial activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned.  For example, section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended, includes a definition of the term &ldquo;public place&rdquo;, which includes all areas of a public or local authority park.  Legal advice has been sought from the Office of the Attorney General as to the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under criminal justice legislation when it comes to the use of scramblers and quad bikes in these areas.<\/p><p>These include search and seizure of scramblers and quad bikes by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to identifying potential legislative solutions.  The public safety and public order concerns relating to scramblers and quad bikes are best addressed through the multi-pronged response being pursued by the interagency group.  The approach includes a review of appropriate criminal justice and public order legislation, education and awareness-raising measures, engagement at local community level, etc.  It was agreed by this task force that the issue must be tackled by a number of means, including consideration of enforcement measures, education and awareness-raising measures, relevant legislation, if necessary, and the potential provision of designated facilities where such vehicles could be used in a safe environment.  At the most recent meeting, it was agreed that road safety officers from the local authorities would organise a campaign urging parents not to buy scramblers or quad bikes as Christmas presents for minors.  The Road Safety Authority will run a similar campaign in the run-up to Christmas.  The local authorities will log complaints and incidents relating to scramblers and quad bikes in open spaces and parks during a particular week in the latter part of 2018 to attempt to gauge the scale of the issue.  The task force is due to meet again next month to review progress and will engage again with local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to fully understand the difficulties encountered in dealing with this type of anti-social behaviour and to learn from community policing successes in this area.<\/p> <p> The Department of Justice and Equality is consulting further with local authorities in the context of the many examples of positive engagement fostered by local authorities with local communities.  A number of initiatives and projects are of potential interest insofar as the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes are concerned.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that I am fully behind the excellent intentions of the movers of this Bill.  However, I do not believe it is appropriate to tackle the issue by changing the definition of \"public place\" in the Road Traffic Acts.  I see a solution to this issue coming from the work of the interagency group, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality and established earlier this year to deal with the misuse of quads and scramblers.  The legal advice the Department of Justice and Equality receives from the Office of the Attorney General with regard to these matters will be instructive in providing a solution as well.<\/p> <p> The intentions of Deputy Ellis and Sinn F&eacute;in are correct and we support them.  We simply believe that the risks attached to changing the definition and the associated approach are high.  There is also a danger of undermining other legislation, a point to which Senator Munster referred.  I meant to say Deputy Munster - that was a Freudian slip and I hope it never comes to pass.  In any event, those risks are not worth taking.  The consequences of undermining other legislation would be unforgivable.  Therefore, as a matter of urgency we are addressing other ways of ensuring that the measures Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing can be secured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700026#DD00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539782700,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I intend to share time with Deputy Curran and Deputy John Brassil by permission of the House.<\/p><p>I compliment Deputy Ellis on using Sinn F&eacute;in's Private Members' time to bring forward this Bill in his attempt to try to address the current lacuna in the law.  Deputy Ellis referred to the urgency of the matter.  He also noted that he introduced the Bill in the D&aacute;il a year and a half ago, but it has taken Sinn F&eacute;in 18 months to use Private Members' business to bring the Bill to the floor of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>My colleague, Deputy John Curran, raised the matter in a parliamentary question to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in December 2016.  In his reply, the Minister stated the Garda had sufficient powers to deal with this menace.  We know that is not the case.  The delay in the Minister coming to the realisation that there needs to be a change in this law has resulted in the ongoing illegal use of these quads by people who are terrorising others in public places, often causing serious injury.  My colleague, Councillor Paul McAuliffe, has raised this issue on several occasions at meetings of the joint policing committee.  He too is keen to see legislation to address this issue.  However, our job is to ensure that we enact robust legislation that is not open to challenge and does not undermine other legislation.<\/p><p>I realise Sinn F&eacute;in is looking over to see what Fianna F&aacute;il is doing on this.  We know Sinn F&eacute;in is a latecomer to the law of the land, but the simple fact of the matter is that we must ensure any legislation passed in the House is robust and accurate.  Not only will this legislation, if enacted, be open to challenge but it has the capacity to render all other traffic legislation vulnerable to legal challenge and impede enforcement of the law of the land.  I cannot imagine anyone wants to see such an outcome.<\/p><p>Several legal challenges have been brought against prosecutions of road traffic offences on the basis of whether the alleged offences took place in a private place.  Over the years, the definition of &quot;public place&quot; in the context of road traffic law has been strengthened as a result of these cases and the understanding of the courts has been deeply enriched.  Amending the definition of &quot;public place&quot;, as this Bill proposes, would potentially undo much of the work that has been done.  The current definition of a &quot;public place&quot; in the road traffic legislation is &quot;any public road&quot; and &quot;any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge&quot;.<\/p><p>This Private Members' Bill proposes to amend section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, which concerns the detention of vehicles, and expand the definition of &quot;public place&quot; by adding the following meaning: &quot;any outdoor area including public parks to which members of the public have or are permitted to have access, whether as of right or as a trespasser or otherwise and which is used for public recreational purposes&quot;.<\/p><p>It took the Minister months, if not years, to bring forward an amendment to the road traffic laws.  As I indicated, 18 months ago he took the view there was no need to address this issue.  There was, however, a clear need to address the issue.  In December 2017, the Law Society of Ireland called on the Government to tear up the current road traffic laws and start again.  Its chief executive, Ken Murphy, stated:<\/p><blockquote>Road Traffic Acts in Ireland are needlessly complex and confusing and need urgent consolidation and simplification.<br \/><br \/>There is consensus within the legal profession that Road Traffic legislation is needlessly complex and confusing, as they were described by the late Supreme Court judge, Justice Adrian Hardiman.  There are 22 different Acts on the books that deal with road traffic laws, with hundreds of other tangentially-related pieces of legislation that require consideration when judges are adjudicating on road law violations.<br \/><br \/>David Staunton, the barrister and author of the book &ldquo;Drunken Driving&rdquo;, has argued that we need to tear up the current system and start again. That is a conclusion that our profession would support.<br \/><br \/>Such needless complexity in legislation undermines public confidence in the justice system.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister stated he supports the principle of the Bill.  We on this side also want to see the principle realised.  I have no doubt Deputy Ellis is sincere and genuine about the legislation and we want the matter addressed.  Earlier, I asked Deputy Ellis whether he would be prepared to withdraw this Bill for two months to enable the Department of Justice and Equality to work with him and other Deputies to bring forward legislation that will not leave other road traffic legislation open to challenge.  That might be a way to move this forward.  Will the Minister give such a commitment?<\/p><p>The Minister said that road safety is of paramount concern to him in his role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To be fair, it is one of few areas on which he has been able to bring forward legislation in the D&aacute;il in the two years since his appointment.  When does he intend to follow the advice of the Law Society of Ireland and begin working as a matter of priority to address the complexities of the road traffic legislation?<\/p><p>Does he intend to consolidate it to ensure it is fit for purpose, not open to challenge and that it will reduce the number of serious injuries and fatalities on our roads?<\/p> <p> The other recommendation the Law Society made to the Government in December last year was the need to increase the number of judges because of the backlog in getting cases addressed by the judicial system.  We know that the only intervention from the Minister, Deputy Ross, regarding the appointment of judges is the prevention and holding up of the appointment of judges.  If we want people convicted of road traffic offences put off the road, we need more judges in the District Court to hear those cases and ensure that offenders are suspended and put off the road.<\/p> <p> Deputy Curran and Councillor Paul McAuliffe have raised this issue previously.  My colleague and our deputy party leader, Deputy Dara Calleary, produced a Bill on it.  There is cross-party support for ensuring that a solution can be achieved in regard to this menace on our roads and in public spaces, but we have to be conscious that we do it right, that it is fit for purpose and not open to legal challenge.

It is an issue that I and others have raised consistently in this House over the past two and a half years yet the problem of the dangerous use of quad and scrambler bikes in parks, other public areas and housing estates is getting worse.  The problem is growing year on year.  During the summer there was a very serious case in one of our parks in Darndale, and there have been fatalities also.  Their use is not just a nuisance factor; it involves real danger.<\/p>  <p>  This is an issue local authorities are acutely aware of as it comes up regularly at all their meetings.  I sit on the joint policing committee in South Dublin County Council's administrative area.  At every meeting, this issue is top of the agenda as the most problematic to deal with, and the problem is not getting any better.  Local authorities take as many preventative steps as they can to deal with this problem in terms of boundary treatments of parks, kissing gates and so forth but, inevitably, regardless of the physical actions and engineering solutions they try to implement, they do not achieve the target.  They are vandalised, broken down, rammed and so on, and the problem persists.  When one attends a joint policing committee, it is interesting to see that everybody is singing off the same hymn sheet in terms of this problem.  A legislative solution to it has to be found.

Many open areas in our parks that should be recreational areas are now no-go areas.  People are afraid to use them.  I am involved with all my colleagues from the area but in particular with one colleague in South Dublin County Council, who is here today.  We have a high-level group.  I will not name the park for obvious reasons but a substantial effort is being made involving the garda&iacute;, the council officials and the elected representatives to try to gain public ownership of our park, bring it back into use and deal with the scourge of the illegal and dangerous use of quad bikes and scramblers.<\/p>  <p>  While my colleague, Deputy Troy, and the Minister set out the challenges this legislation would pose in terms of other road traffic legislation and identifying public open spaces, I do not believe the legislation would be as effective as we might think.  I say that because at every joint policing committee meeting I have attended the garda&iacute; indicate clearly, and these are public meetings so it is a matter of public record, that they have been instructed not to stop people physically using those bikes.  If someone is using quad or scrambler bikes on a public road or in a park, the garda&iacute; are not in a position to enforce the laws physically.  Currently, it is illegal for such bikes to be on the roads but from a practical enforcement point of view, the garda&iacute; cannot enforce the laws for their own health and safety and that of those engaged in the activity.  From that point of view, I do not believe the legislation as presented is sufficient.  We need to go further than that.<\/p>  <p>  I was glad to hear the Minister singing off the same page as everybody else and that he is interested in trying to develop a solution.  I have been frustrated.  The first record I have of raising this issue with the Minister was on 7 December 2016.  Frankly, when I read the answer at the time I could see he was oblivious to the fact that there was an issue with these bikes.  He outlined all the existing laws in the reply.  He stated that various quads and other bikes in a public place must have insurance, road tax, a driving licence, the driver must wear a helmet and that there are severe penalties under the road traffic laws.  He went on to state that a park can be dealt with by local authorities by way of various by-laws.  He went on to indicate that the Road Traffic Act 2004 makes it an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a person under 16, regardless of whether it is a gift.  He stated also that enforcement of the road traffic laws are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that he is informed that they are satisfied that they have the necessary powers to deal with cases concerning the use of quads, scramblers and bikes.  That is what the Minister said in his reply but at the same time in our joint policing committee, the garda&iacute; were saying something completely different.  That line persisted for a long time, so the Minister's change of view today is most welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I did not ask questions just of the Minister.  I also asked them of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I want to acknowledge the change in direction the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has taken in the past year in that he has realised that an inter-agency approach must be taken to this problem if we are to deal with it significantly.  To that end, he has convened a number of meetings on it but one in particular across Departments and agencies.  He has also engaged with the local authorities, which know at first hand the problems these vehicles are causing in our parks.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the initiative taken by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, but it is time that that now results in legislation being brought forward.  The type of legislation required must go much further than just referring to road traffic Acts.  There must be power in the legislation to have these vehicles seized when they are not in use.  Everybody living in the housing estates knows who owns them.  They have seen them in use and they see the problems they create.  There must be a mechanism from an intelligence led point of view whereby the Garda has the power to seize them when these people return to their homes and not try to apprehend them when they are in use on the streets or in parks.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the effort of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in bringing this Bill to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  This is a scourge on the environment.  I urge the Minister, irrespective of the outcome of the vote on this measure, to work in particular with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to bring concrete proposals to this House as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700028#FF00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1539783300,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I very much support the sentiment behind this Bill.

The problem of the misuse of quad bikes and scrambler motorcycles has become more and more prevalent in the past five years.  In the past three years over 180 people have been injured in accidents involving off-road vehicles.  Of the 180, we cannot forgot the terrible story of Ilabek Avetian, a 39 year old Armenian man who was hospitalised with a series of head injuries after an incident in a park when a scrambler bike landed on him as he was sunbathing with his wife last June.  The couple had moved to Ireland from Lithuania only a couple of months previously to seek a better life, but because of the accident Mr. Avetian is seriously ill, forever changing his life and that of his wife.  Before that, there was the case of 16 year old Warren Kenny from Cherry Orchard who was involved in a fatal accident on Christmas Day in 2016 and the almost identical case of 19 year old Leroy Coyle who was involved in a fatal accident on Christmas Day in 2013.  The list of stories goes on and on.<\/p>  <p>  The common problem behind these preventable accidents is that some owners of quad bikes and scrambler motorcycles believe they can get away with using their vehicle wherever and whenever they choose.  While the Road Traffic Act 1961 restricts the usage of these off-road vehicles to public places, it has always been interpreted to mean only public roads.  However, as the public knows, a percentage of owners unlawfully use their off-road vehicle in public spaces such as parks, green spaces, housing estates and other public and private properties.  When they do, they endanger pedestrians with the erratic and rash driving of their vehicle.  There have been reports on such vehicles unlawfully being used in anti-social behaviour in Ward River Valley Park in Swords in my constituency and areas in Fingal such as Balbriggan beach, Donabate and Portmarnock, to name just a few.  In Ward River Valley Park in Swords scrambler users have been known to follow a so-called \"circuit\" which involves them exiting the park on the path to make a loop in an adjoining estate and then turning sharply back into the park.  It is the most dangerous grand prix I can imagine and only a matter of time before tragedy strikes at this location.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that people do not feel safe in shared public spaces such as parks, green spaces and housing estates.  The Bill effectively includes all of these areas within the jurisdiction of the Garda to deal effectively with those who unlawfully use quad bikes and scrambler motorcycles.  I appreciate that the Bill does not criminalise all owners and drivers of quad bikes and scrambler motorcycles.  We all acknowledge that those who misuse or unlawfully use these off-road vehicles do not represent all owners and drivers.  That is why the amendment Bill does not add penalties.  Instead, it seeks to extend the Garda&rsquo;s power to the areas that were not covered in the previous legislation such that it can now seize the bikes and scramblers used unlawfully in areas that will be covered under the Bill.  The Bill, rightly, does not ban the vehicles completely because it is acknowledged that there are many owners who drive them responsibly and safely in designated areas such as motor parks and designated off-road areas.  Instead it makes sure those individuals who use them to engage in anti-social behaviour such as carelessly driving through parks or green spaces, speeding through housing estates, doing wheelies and revving their engines to irritate the inhabitants of the neighbourhood or terrorise innocent people for fun will not get away with their behaviour.  If individuals cannot drive responsibly, it not only puts others in danger but also themselves.  There have been a number of accidents, some fatal, caused by two individuals on scrambler motorcycles colliding or driving into a parked car.  Thus, by restricting where these vehicles can lawfully be driven, we can hold drivers accountable to ensure they engage in safe driving practices, not just for the safety of the public but also for their own safety.  The sad fact is that many vehicle owners who engage in anti-social behaviour are young and inexperienced drivers who are seeking the thrill of driving recklessly and who think they can beat the odds and will not be involved in an accident.  Thus, we must go above and beyond to make sure that while they may not see the imminent danger in which they are putting others and themselves, we will plan in advance to protect them from themselves.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that this issue be dealt with nationally through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is essential that the Government address the issue.  Some local councils have brought forward by-laws to try to curb the havoc created by some of these vehicles, but the Garda has little to no authority to enforce them, especially in many of the areas that have not been but will now be covered in the amending legislation.  With Christmas approaching, we know about the sad inevitability of parents buying these off-road vehicles for their children who are often much too young.  While the Garda and some city councils have led awareness campaigns on the responsible usage of these vehicles and their purchase for children, they have not affected the number of children, many under the legal age of 16 years, who take their new vehicles onto streets and roads and into parks at Christmas time.  One only has to look at the heartbreaking cases to which I have referred.  Christmas Day is a day for families, opening presents and eating a meal together, not sitting in a hospital worrying about the state of one&rsquo;s child, mother, father or friend who was involved in a quad bike or scrambler motorcycle accident.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is more important than ever and very welcome.  Let us make sure we do everything we can to make sure Christmas Day will go by without an accident occurring involving the use of these bikes.  The Labour Party supports the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700029#GG00200","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1539783900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The Bill is probably well meant, but the reality is that we need to start in ensuring the safety of quad bikes and scramblers by getting the manufacturers to place safety roll bars on them.  The statistics for the numbers of injuries and deaths show that, unfortunately, a lot of the incidents involving these vehicles occur in farmers' fields when they turn over.  Those involved who may have been driving them for a long time may lose a limb or be killed.  Therefore, we need to make sure the manufacturers place safety roll bars on them.<\/p>  <p>  In this country we think we can give the Garda every job in the world to do and that it will solve everything.  In fairness, when numbers in the Garda traffic corps have been brought down from 1,100 to 570, they cannot be everywhere.  If a garda finds someone using one of these vehicles on the road, in a lot of cases the quad bike has not been licensed for road use.  That is the first point.  The Garda can take the necessary steps to deal with that issue.  I am open to correction, but my understanding of the Bill is that we are moving more to include use in parks.  We need to be careful when legislating to avoid including private property.  I understand fully, however, that we need to tighten the legislation where these vehicles are used up and down roads.  In fairness, they are used down the country for the right purposes such as bringing cows from one place to another.  The vehicles have indicator and other lights on them and are roadworthy.  We need to concentrate first on the safety measures required to save lives.

It is unfortunate the Government is not supporting it because it is a good amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of motocross participants are very responsible.  There is a minority who are irresponsible and that is played out in housing estates where I live where young people mainly are using them recklessly without helmets, going though parks and estates. That has led to deaths and serious injuries not only for those taking part but for also members of the public and other car users.  Obviously it is a nuisance to the public.<\/p>  <p>  Some young people are looking for the adrenaline rush of being chased by the Garda and going 70 km\/h or 80 km\/h along a road.  How can we turn that into a more positive thing?  I make some comparisons.  We had, and still have, in many housing estates the problem of roaming horses.  There was legislative change in 1996, accompanied by a task force approach to trying to educate people about horses and so forth.  As a result of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regulation it has largely worked.  Regulation alone will not work.  I welcome the task force approach to the issue.  At local meetings attended by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, me and others, this issue constantly comes up.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to consider practical solutions and not just regulations.  There are many motocross tracks in Dublin and other parts of the country, more than most people might think.  Fingal County Council gave Mulhuddart Motocross Club 15 acres of land.  Club members say that there had been a problem with people using vehicles recklessly.  However, since the advent of the motocross club, incidents have reduced by 60% to 70%.  It is not a panacea by any means, but certainly it is an issue that I hope the task force will take on board.  If people have a controlled safe environment to use these motocross bikes, not only are they using them professionally, they find out how they work mechanically which helps with health and safety.<\/p>  <p>  There is another track in East Wall and a very good one in County Offaly.  I know some of the members there.  Most people who use these vehicles use them extremely responsibly and professionally.  It is a sport after all.  One of the oldest institutions in Ireland is the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland, which is 112 years old.  It has been advocating on behalf of motorcycling throughout Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I make a point about parents buying vehicles for their children.  I have come across parents buying small mopeds for children as young as seven or eight.  I do not know what the parents are thinking because this is a lethal vehicle that can go up to 70 km\/h or 80 km\/h.  Any human being who comes off at that speed, regardless of whether they are wearing a helmet, will sustain serious injury.  There are many nuances to this.  I know some people who are irresponsible with motor vehicles like this.  It is possible to bring them in and say that this is irresponsible and that they are going to kill themselves or kill somebody else.  If they want to use that approach, it should be accompanied by having a track or an environment where it is safe for them.  That will go some way towards addressing the bigger issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700030#HH00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1539784500,"counter":281,"content":"<p>In 2015 or early 2016, Deputy Gino Kenny and I organised a public gathering between Clondalkin and Ballyfermot because this was such a hot topic.  Tragically, it was after the death of the 16 year old Warren Kenny on Christmas Day.  It prompted us to push forward working with the youth groups to see what we could do to garner the energy around this as a sport.  We looked for land from South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council to develop a motocross track.  We visited the tracks in East Wall and Mulhuddart to see how it all worked.  I am sorry to say that that project does not seem to have moved forward.  I think much of it relates to holding on to the land for the housing crisis and yet not even dealing with the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, as has been said, there is a need to address the issue of motocross quad bike use as something that is part of a culture and part of what young people do instead of always looking to punish and box them off to stop them doing it.  Deputy Ellis of Sinn F&eacute;in has made a very sensible proposal that we fully support, which is to have some regulation and legislation on the use and sale of these bikes.  If the Bill reaches Committee Stage, we should look at how we can regulate the sale and the authorisation of who can buy and own these bikes and what responsibility attaches to them.  As everyone knows, when a car or a motorbike is bought, it has to have a logbook.  Therefore, there is traceability of ownership and who has responsibility for it.  There are many measures we could look at in terms of regulation attached to the Bill.  It would be shameful for the Minister and his colleagues on the Government benches to try to block the passage of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  There have been at least two deaths of young men and the destruction of a young couple's lives in Darndale very recently.  If that happened in the Minister's constituency, I am sure he would address it very rapidly.  I am not implying that he is a snob in any way, but I am saying this is an issue that seems to affect working-class areas more than others.  It must be addressed and it would be shameful for the Government to try to block the Bill.  It should be passed and proceed to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  We should look seriously at what we can do in terms of regulation and also in terms of pursuing the need to develop motocross as a sport.  Not only do young people learn a discipline around it, they also learn about mechanics and take an interest in the competitive sport in which they are involved, and it deals with the neglect of working-class areas that is wholesale in the places where we live.<\/p>  <p>  We should not penalise people who use them.  We should look to absorb it into the culture.  We are talking about how we change the culture of the Garda following last week's report.  We should also look at how we change the culture in our communities to make it better, healthier and more inclusive of everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700030#HH00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1539784500,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who is sharing time with Deputy Broughan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700030#HH00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1539784500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I have been listening to the debate both in the office and since I came into the Chamber.

The Bill before the House is one way of addressing it and I hope we can reach some consensus or there can be some collaboration to address people's genuine concerns.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge those who have quads and scramblers and use them in a very positive way, including those who have quads and scramblers because they are functional vehicles for their work on farms, on beach patrols by lifeguards or for other activities by rangers.  The problems arise when they are used in a particular urban setting.  Unfortunately, much of that is associated with an antisocial element.  These are off-road vehicles and they present problems in highly populated urban spaces, particularly in our open parks.<\/p>  <p>  People have mentioned fatalities and Dublin Central has also seen fatalities, including a few years ago on Christmas Day.  Christmas Day presents a particular problem because the roads and parks are generally much emptier, which presents an opportunity for those with scramblers and quad bikes to drive at very high speeds.  In the majority of cases, unfortunately, the users have no safety helmets and no documentation.  Of course, there is a bravado element to this.  It is part of the ego trip or whatever and they spur each other on to go even faster.<\/p><p> I also make the point that garda&iacute; have powers to stop and to confiscate.  However, garda&iacute; have been forthright at different community policing forum meetings I have attended that they are very cautious because they are aware of the dangers of giving chase.  Sometimes giving chase only fuels the activity because some young people want to be chased by garda&iacute; and, therefore, the garda&iacute; are afraid there could be a very serious accident.  Garda&iacute; must have public safety at the core of their work.  They have come in for a lot of criticism because they are not going after these young people but I can understand where they are coming from, given the thrill the bike riders get from being chased by garda&iacute;.<\/p> <p> With regard to awareness of the dangers, a public awareness campaign is something the RSA or some other body could take on.  We have had public awareness campaigns on drink driving, seat belts and mobile phones, and I believe something similar would be useful in this regard.  Like Deputy Gino Kenny, I cannot understand how parents would buy these items for small children.  I also cannot understand how the sellers of these machines can get away with selling them without having much better safety precautions and ensuring a safety helmet is bought with them.<\/p> <p> With regard to motocross, there was a very successful project on the Alfie Byrne Road run by Dublin City Council with the local motocross club, whereby people could go to a designated area with their scramblers and bikes.  This is something that should be pursued.  Let us face it: these bikes, quads and scramblers will continue to be bought, unfortunately, so we need awareness and regulation, particularly for public parks.  I was at a community policing forum meeting last week and it was very sad to listen to old people telling us they were afraid to go into the public park because these quads and scramblers would be there and they were afraid of being knocked down.<\/p> <p> We have to tackle the issue, whether it is through Deputy Ellis's Bill or otherwise.  The important point is that it is tackled.  I am sure it does not matter to Deputy Ellis how it is tackled but it has to be through a collaborative effort so something real happens.<\/p> <p> As we are on this subject, I make a plea to the Minister in regard to the legislation on rickshaws.

I commend Deputies Dessie Ellis and Imelda Munster on bringing the Bill forward and I will, of course, support it.  Figures recently released to me by the HSE showed that, on average, at least one person per week is injured by an &ldquo;all-terrain or other motor vehicle designed primarily for off-road use&rdquo;.  In fact, the Minister for Health told me there were 56 such injuries in 2015, 71 in 2016 and 62 in 2017.  Of course, earlier this year, in my constituency of Dublin Bay North, we had the tragic case of the couple, former teacher Anzhela Kotsinian and her roofer husband Ilabek Avetian, whose lives were changed dramatically after a scrambler landed on them in a local park and left Mr. Avetian with devastating injuries.  Over many years, constituents have had their peace disturbed or have been placed in acute danger by the use of scramblers in high amenity areas across the north of Dublin Bay North such as Streamville Park, Darndale Park and Riverside Green.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport many parliamentary questions about the regulation of scramblers and quad bikes and, like other Deputies, I have spoken directly with Dublin city and Fingal officials.  The replies given to me maintain there are already sufficient powers bestowed upon the Garda to enforce &ldquo;severe penalties under the road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle)&rdquo;.  In fact, a parliamentary question reply I received in 2017 stated: &ldquo;An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can also use section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to perform an examination of roadworthiness of any vehicle being used in a public place&rdquo;, which obviously should include parks and amenity open spaces.  I was also informed that local authorities can introduce necessary by-laws.<\/p>  <p>  We know from many concerned constituents that when they phone the Garda about this dangerous driving, they are often told no cars are available.  This is despite the fact there may be the whining noise of scramblers beside a house for hours on end, and there may be people who are not well in the house or children who have gone to bed, and so on.  Mr. Justice Charleton, in his report last week, stated: &ldquo;It is extraordinarily rare that garda&iacute; are seen in uniform on the streets,&rdquo; especially compared with &ldquo;other major cities, such as Rome and London and Athens, where police are visible at intersections, at junctions and in public plazas.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has told me a working group is examining a cross-agency approach to tackle the growing illegal and dangerous use of quads and scramblers.  I believe this task force is also looking at possible designated safe areas and that the group met just last month.  We look forward to seeing a result from that.  As Deputies Ellis and Munster know, however, we often get answers from Government Departments telling us there is no lacuna in legislation, although we then see the real lack of enforcement, which seems to be based on gaps in legislation.  Indeed, I referred an issue to the Minister for Justice and Equality earlier today in regard to the road traffic Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This is a short but significant Bill to amend section 41 of the Road Traffic Act to allow garda&iacute; to seize scramblers and quad bikes in instances where they are being used unlawfully.  We need to address this once and for all and I believe the new subsection (6) will be very valuable in this regard.  As with the supply of old cars and a range of illegal substances, I believe An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should target those who supply quad bikes and scramblers to children, including manufacturers, importers, retailers and everybody down the business line.  The whole area of regulation, registration, licensing, tax and driver training is very unclear or non-existent in regard to these vehicles, despite the fact such vehicles can be a shocking nuisance and, in the case of Ilabek Avetian, can leave a man seriously injured for the rest of his life.  In addition, as my colleague said, as we come towards the Christmas season, we need to be aware some youngsters will receive quads and scramblers as presents.<\/p>  <p>  I warmly commend Deputies Ellis and Munster.  The Bill is an important step towards getting to grips with this issue and I thank them for bringing it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700031#JJ00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1539785100,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I too am pleased to speak on this Bill brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in regarding quads and scramblers.

It can be horrendous, given the interference, the dangers and the damage that is done to wildlife, mountainsides and flora and fauna on the tracks.  While I do not want to be seen as a killjoy, I have to declare I used to own a quad and my son now has it on the farm.  We certainly need to regulate these vehicles and to examine this issue seriously.  We also need to restrict the speed they do.  The scramblers are very fast and the quads are hard to drive because they do not go around a bend the same as a motorbike.  They are four-wheel vehicles and if they are four-wheel drive, they pull at the front.  They are dangerous and scary.<\/p>  <p>  There must be licensing of such vehicles.  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice in regard to roll bars.  There should certainly be roll bars, as well as speed restrictions.  The Minister could use one if he had it here because they would go up the side of a wall - that is how dangerous they are.  If they lose grip and flip over, however, a person can be killed.  There have been several fatalities, including one in my county involving a young boy of 14.  His dad came home from work at 11 o'clock at night and went looking for him.  He was trapped under the quad and, unfortunately, he had been killed.  These are serious vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is probably more acute in cities and urban areas, where scramblers are being used around parks and streets, which is treacherous as a child could run out in front of them.  Those using them are thrill seekers.  Although the traffic corps has been decimated, garda&iacute; have the power under section 40 of the Road Traffic Act to seize these vehicles.  They should not be driving around in their patrol vehicles trying to apprehend them but, instead, they should be trying to find out who owns them and where they are parked, so they can seize them if there is evidence they were out on the road and being used illegally.  It is very important we have that back-up.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that more onus is put on the people who sell these vehicles.  Anyone who goes to a ploughing match or to a show of any size will know salespeople are there selling them.  As I said, quads are used for many different farming tasks, such as lambing, tending sheep and spraying, and I saw a person recently who had a little grass cutter attached to the back of one, so they can be adapted.  However, we need to have documentary evidence of when they are sold so we can clamp down on their use.  We need to know who is the registered owner.<\/p><p>As with the one I have, they should be registered and some form of tax or rather a tracing mechanism should apply as with an untaxed or uninsured vehicle.  Where minors use them, they are definitely not insured because minors could not get insurance.  It is a huge issue.<\/p> <p> The urban issue is very troublesome.  These vehicles cause a nuisance and generate noise.  TidyTowns are trying to work in areas where people get into a them-and-us way of thinking and start to skid around, tearing up grass, flowers and plants.  There needs to be some law to address that.  We should think of those who are sick and are faced with that noise and annoyance.  We should think of those working night duty, including nurses, doctors and paramedics who are trying to sleep while this is going on in their estates.  It is an area which needs a great deal of examination.  As such, the Minister, Deputy Ross, would do well to listen to all speakers, including me, rather than to have disappeared like the snow on a ditch when a bit of sun comes out.  The sun is shining today.  The Minister needs to grow up and understand all aspects of the Road Traffic (Quads and Scramblers) Bill.  He must be prepared to listen to all Deputies.<\/p> <p> I give way to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and note that I support any measured attempt to restrain the misuse of these vehicles.  That said, we must think of the upland farmers who need them.  They need to be responsible in their use and schools must get involved in educating young people about their dangers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700031#JJ00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539785700,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister will read avidly the transcript of Deputy McGrath's contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700032#KK00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1539785700,"counter":291,"content":"<p>He is probably watching on the screen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700032#KK00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1539785700,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being here earlier but I was chairing a meeting.  I have a couple of important points to make on the Bill.  When it comes to regulation, we must be careful to ensure we avoid harming people who need these vehicles.  I know first-hand of the important role quads play in many facets of life, including in farming communities and among contractors.  One even sees their use now in road traffic management where road works are being carried out.  They are a convenient vehicle for convoying during road works and escorting traffic in a managed way.  They are very important vehicles on and off our roads.  There are many farmers who would be more upset if one took their quad than if one took anything else.  Quads save their legs whether it is to repair fences or go out on the land when sheep are grazing.  There are many attachments one can use, including a box to bring a sick or pet lamb home.  We have to be very careful about regulation in those circumstances.  What worries me sometimes is that people can bring in regulations without knowing what they are talking about.  When people think of quads or vehicles like that, they may think of what they have seen where people have used them on beaches for enjoyment purposes.  I am talking, however, about purely practical uses like spraying rushes or topping on ground which cannot be covered by any other vehicle as well as for different contracting purposes.  In everything we do in the House, we must understand what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, in the years since quads came on the scene, a number of my friends have been seriously injured on them.  By their nature, quads do not have cabs or roll bars as they would not be as functional with those.  The fact that they do not have roll bars or a legal requirement for them means injuries have occurred which would not otherwise have been caused.  Things like that must be looked at also.  We must ensure that vehicles are not only practical but safe for users.  I will never forget the story Deputy Mattie McGrath told me about a very sad and horrific event involving a quad.  We must be careful about what we discuss in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700032#KK00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1539785700,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and pledge the support of the Social Democrats for it.  I commend Deputies Ellis and Munster for taking the initiative to bring it forward.  This is the second time Deputy Ellis has tabled a Bill on this matter.  Many Members, including Deputy Ellis and me, have raised this issue consistently over many years.  Unfortunately, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  Consistently, Ministers in this and the previous Government have completely ignored this emerging issue.  Because it has been ignored for so many years, it can now be described as an epidemic facing many urban communities, in particular in cities.  The use of scramblers, quads and motorcycles is the single issue most often raised with me and constituency colleagues at community meetings.  Whether the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, believes that, I do not know, but the Government's actions to date indicate that it does not recognise it as a serious problem.  Any urban Deputy who is in anyway active in his or her constituency will tell one that this is the biggest issue being raised in urban communities.  It is an absolute scourge, in particular in working class areas.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is not the legal use of these vehicles.  Some of our rural Deputies raised concerns about their farmer colleagues, but this is not about people using quads, scramblers or motorbikes legally.  It is about people using them illegally.  Principally, we are talking about people who are over 16 and using them illegally and the even bigger problem of minors using them.  These vehicles are the new urban horse as others have said.  They have taken such a grip in local communities that it is now commonplace for young people to get them as Christmas, birthday, confirmation or even communion presents.  It is standard now in local communities for this to be a huge public safety issue for the young people themselves who ride the vehicles but also for people using our streets and parks.  It is an issue for other children who have a legitimate right to go out on their own estates or local parks and greens to play safely.  Unfortunately, that is not possible in many housing estates at this stage due to this problem.  As to involving young people in sport, we receive regular complaints of pitches being churned up overnight or in recent days by youths on scramblers and quads.  They fly around pitches doing wheelies and damaging pitches, which prevents other children from playing sport in their local areas.<\/p>  <p>  These vehicles are having a huge impact.  They are also very frightening for older people.  Indeed, they are frightening for people of any age.  There is a real fear now that when one is out walking in one's local estate or park, one is putting oneself in danger of being hit by one of these vehicles.  That is one of the things the Bill seeks to address.  For a number of years, garda&iacute; have told public representatives at public meetings that it is not possible for them to take any action in respect of this activity if it is based on local greens, public parks or fields because road traffic legislation does not apply to those areas.  Garda&iacute; say their hands are tied for this reason.  That is the principal way in which the Bill proposes to deal with one aspect of this problem.  Action to deal with this is overdue but there has been no response from the Government whatsoever.  There have been literally hundreds of parliamentary questions, Topical Issues have been raised and there have been various debates in the House over the years.<\/p><p>There has been no response whatsoever from Government to date as to how to address the specific problem of this high level of activity going on in our parks and public open spaces and the law enforcement authorities being powerless to deal with it.  I do not know whether it is the Minister of State who will respond or what will happen with this Bill, but the Government must reply to us and say how it will deal with this very real problem.  It has been identified by garda&iacute; over many years.  They are precluded from taking any action in these circumstances, yet there is no response from Government as to how they can be dealt with.<\/p> <p> My principal concern is underage people using these bikes.  It is commonplace to see youngsters as young as seven or eight going around on these bikes, sometimes two or even three of them on the one small quad bike or scrambler, flying around local estates.  Nothing is being done about this because the advice to garda&iacute;, understandably, is not to give chase or to pursue young people engaged in this activity because of the potential dangers involved, but that is not good enough.  Garda&iacute; are being advised not to pursue them, but what are we going to do about this?<\/p> <p> About this time last year, I raised this with the Minister responsible at that point, Deputy Flanagan, and asked him to arrange a public awareness campaign in the lead-up to Christmas because it has now become standard practice, because of the failure of the authorities and the Government to act in this area, that these vehicles are given to children as presents.  There is a need for a public awareness campaign telling parents that they and their children will be breaking the law if they go out on these presents.  The response I got at the time was that the Garda press office issued a press statement.  Let us get real about this.  It is a really serious problem that needs to be dealt with.  There is a need for an awareness campaign and for it to be made very clear to parents that they are breaking the law if they allow their children to do this.  Equally, the law on the sale and supply of these vehicles needs to be strengthened.  The Garda's hand needs to be strengthened in terms of powers to seize and dispose of these vehicles in certain circumstances.<\/p> <p> Very many actions could be taken but, unfortunately, none has been taken to date.  The multi-agency task force was set up last April after much pressure on the Minister.  It has met twice and nothing has come out of it yet.  There is no sense of urgency whatsoever on the part of the Government, on the part of either the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  They should both be taking ownership of this.  It is only a matter of time before there are more serious accidents and other people die as a result of this.  Will the Minister of State wake up?  This is a huge public safety issue and a huge issue of disregard for the law and growth in anti-social activity.  What we need now is action from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700032#KK00500","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539786300,"counter":295,"content":"<p>In my constituency scramblers is an enormous issue.  I could today take the Minister of State to one large park which is surrounded by a number of private and council estates, a very vibrant community with very active sports clubs, boxing clubs and community sector, but in which the lives of perhaps 1,000 households are daily negatively affected by the unrestricted use of quads and scramblers.  We have a task force we set up on the council, with council officials, garda&iacute; and the local community doing everything they can within the existing legislative framework, but the problem is not getting any better.  The council is spending tens of thousands of euro on CCTV and the garda&iacute; are putting in whatever additional resources they can, but what they are all telling us - garda&iacute;, council officials, communities and residents - is that the legislative framework does not work.  The specific proposal contained in this Bill is absolutely vital to empower them to do their job.<\/p>  <p>  All I will say to the Minister of State is if he is not convinced by the merits of our arguments, he should come and spend a day with me in Clondalkin.

What they are told time and again is that the legislative framework to deal with this issue is not there.  The garda&iacute; are hampered in how they can do their job.  Most people who use quads and scramblers do so entirely without incident and appropriately, but there are those who use them in an anti-social way.  Just as my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, said, I could bring the Minister of State to Swords or Balbriggan and introduce him to people whose lives are scourged by out-of-control use of these vehicles and youths doing wheelies in playgrounds.  There are kids who cannot cross the road to go to the local playgrounds because they are afraid.

What we do not know is why there is no willingness between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il to address this problem.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Councillor Malachy Quinn, has raised this at meetings of the joint policing committee of Fingal County Council.

He said he absolutely agrees with the intention of the Bill and the objective of tackling the misuse of scramblers and quads in parks and other recreational areas.  He talked about the difficulties in this regard.  He said, \"it is critically important that we all redouble our efforts [to tackle the misuse of these vehicles], including an examination of powers available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\" and so on.  Before he left, he said we have his support.  The difficulty we have is to translate this support into action.  That is collectively what we on this side of the House, and probably some of the Government's own Deputies, are all saying.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Ellis and I raised this matter in the House in 2014.  We put forward a Bill.  Tom Hayes was a Minister of State at the time.  He said after the debate that he was not really aware of the difficulties.  I talked to him about parts of his own constituency.  Were the Minister, Deputy Ross, here, I probably could have outlined to him some of the areas in his constituency where this is a problem.  It is a huge problem - collectively, I think we know that - and it is not going away.  In 2014 we were told sufficient legislation was in place to deal with this difficulty.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, said that \"earlier this year, the Department of Justice and Equality convened meetings with key Departments and agencies on the misuse of scramblers\" and that \"a multi-agency task force was established, including representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the local authorities and other bodies concerned\".  We were told the same in 2014 by the then Minister of State, Mr. Hayes.  It is now 2018, four years later, but people are still facing this problem.<\/p>  <p>  In the past two weeks, I have received representations from different areas, not all typical working-class areas.  This is a problem in estates right across my constituency.  In one area there are about eight quads and scrambler bikes.  The majority of the people who use them are involved in drug dealing, so even if the bike is taken from them, they can replace it the following year if they are involved in that.<\/p><p>I have seen photographs taken with a camera in people's cars of quad bikes on two wheels on main roads in estates and scramblers on one wheel.  Parks and green spaces should be inclusive spaces.  The problem we face is that no elderly person, certainly nobody with a pram or in a wheelchair, would go into a park in these circumstances.  No parent would allow his or her children to do so.  Those who use these vehicles are frightening people off by intimidating and harassing them.  <\/p> <p> Other Deputies have referred to the problems people face in their homes.  Many people cannot get out of them for mobility reasons.  People were tortured for the entire summer, but it has not stopped now that the summer is over.  The \"vroom vroom\" continues at this time of the year when it gets dark earlier and earlier.  It is not as if it starts at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.  In some cases, it starts at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. and continues until midnight or 1 a.m.  Regardless of what windows someone has in his or her house, he or she will hear this noise.  It is a problem.  What do people do?  They ring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in some cases garda&iacute; come out.  In fairness, in some cases they take quad bikes off those who are using them or track those involved back to their houses.  The Garda Press Office issued a photograph after the recent incident in Darndale to show that garda&iacute; had taken some scramblers and quad bikes off the road.  That is all very well, but this problem is still arising and actually multiplying.  I recently spoke to a resident who was terrified of what would happen at Christmas because she knew that it would lead to more quad bikes being used.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to tell the House what he can do.  As Opposition Deputies, we have tried to introduce legislation, but we have been told that it would make the law more vulnerable.  The Garda Press Office told us four years ago that sufficient laws were in place, that further laws would interfere and take resources and that diversionary approaches would be taken in respect of those at risk of offending.  We were told that all sorts of system were in place.  We can agree collectively that there is a problem.  Fianna F&aacute;il has suggested we put this proposal which has been passed on First Stage on hold for two or three months.  If we do, how long will we have to wait for concrete solutions to this problem?  Are there answers in the script prepared for the Minister of State?  Does the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, have to come back in?  For how long will the task force sit?  I have referred to what we were told four years ago.  The Minister referred to a more recent development.  Perhaps it stopped when the Government fell or after the general election.  I do not know, but we need solutions as people are crying out for help.<\/p> <p> The issue is not confined to cities and towns.  It is affecting people across Ireland.  It does not have an impact in rural Ireland where it is seen as positive.  Reference has been made to quad bike safety.  We are conscious that the people who use quad bikes and scramblers are a danger to the general public, themselves and other road users.  I have mentioned some of the specific dangers.  It is time for solutions.  If the Bill is voted down, when can we expect further legislation to come from the Department?  People who are trapped in their homes are being driven mad by what is happening in fields and green spaces outside their houses.  When will they receive positive messages from the Government?  They want to hear about what it can do, rather than about what the Bill does not do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700033#LL00400","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539786900,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  While I wholeheartedly agree that the scourge of adults and minors misusing scramblers and quad bikes in public parks must be dealt with, I do not think the solution to the problem involves broadening the definition of a \"public place\", as defined in the Road Traffic Acts, to include public parks.  If we were to change the definition which is a cornerstone of all road traffic legislation, it could have incalculable consequences such as the mounting of legal challenges to prosecutions under the Road Traffic Acts, particularly in the area of intoxicated driving.  If we were to extend the definition of a \"public place\" to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain vehicles under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, it would have a contradictory effect on a number of other sections of the overall Road Traffic Acts, thereby increasing the danger of challenges to road traffic legislation being mounted and undermining the enforcement of that legislation and subsequent prosecutions under it.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the approach being taken by the task force established under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality is the correct one.  The Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local authorities are represented on the task force which is tackling the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes by a number of means, including enhanced enforcement measures, education, awareness-raising, relevant legislation and the potential use of designated facilities where such vehicles could be used in a safe environment.  I welcome the news that local authority road safety officers are about to mount a campaign to urge parents not to purchase scramblers or quad bikes for their children for Christmas.  The Road Safety Authority is always willing to engage with stakeholders to help to raise awareness and educate people on the issue of road safety, on which it will campaign in the run-up to Christmas.  Although the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in public parks must be tackled, it is not appropriate to use the Road Traffic Acts to do so.  I look forward to the review of criminal justice and public order legislation and the departmental task force's review of educational and other measures.  The reviews will determine what further measures may be necessary to assist in curbing anti-social activity involving the use of scramblers and quad bikes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700034#MM00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1539786900,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The debate will be brought to a conclusion by Deputies Denise Mitchell and Dessie Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700034#MM00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1539786900,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il intend to oppose the Bill, the aim of which is to tackle the absolute scourge that is the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.

It is totally unfair that residents are being kept up until all hours of the night as these vehicles tear through their estates.  It is totally unfair, when local football and GAA teams show up to play matches on a Saturday and Sunday morning, that they often find that their pitches have been torn up by scramblers.  It is also totally unfair that parents are afraid to let their children play in local green spaces because of the dangers posed by scramblers.

We are specifically referring to public spaces as defined under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, but if there are repercussions, let us move to the next Stage and do what is required to alleviate the problem.<\/p>  <p>  It is possible that additional issues might need to be addressed and explored, and existing legislation might cover some of them, but following are the types of matters that need to be considered: proper insurance cover and licensing; powers of confiscation and storage of illegal bikes; training and specific courses for those using such vehicles; the requirement to wear helmets and visibility vests; roller bars, as outlined by some of our rural Deputies; a proper register of such vehicles; log books that will be passed from buyer to buyer; licence plates on all bikes and quads; sellers and those advertising the sale of quads and scramblers indicating clearly that it is illegal to sell such vehicles to anyone under 16 years of age; the possibility of an NCT; the destruction of such vehicles after confiscation, in respect of which we are told legislation may be required; and using tracking units as found in cars and so on, which most people know can be done.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Troy mentioned suspending the Bill.  I remind him and his party that they had the opportunity to table an amendment.  Alternatively, they could allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage where the issues with it could be examined.  This is a cop-out by Fianna F&aacute;il in support of the Government.  That this is a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is behind that decision.<\/p>  <p>  We have raised this issue in the D&aacute;il since 2014 when we introduced a similar Bill and received a similar answer, which Deputy Crowe has outlined.  Councillor Paul McAuliffe was mentioned.  Both he and Deputy Rock of the Minister of State's party indicated to me that they would support and were in favour of this Bill.  They did that in front of safety forum and policing forum meetings, but now I find that the Bill will be opposed.  I find that hypocritical.  It is sad that such a serious issue is being kicked down the road on the grounds that a group of people will meet, given that we were told the same thing in 2014.  All the Minister of State is doing now is kicking this down the road for another few years.  We have seen the consequences of doing that, such as the recent tragedy in Darndale, and it is inevitable that there will be more.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is not about people who operate quads and scramblers lawfully, including on farms.  This is about people who operate them illegally.  No one in Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael appears to be saying that there is not a problem or that there is something wrong with what we are suggesting.  Rather, those parties are saying that the Bill will have repercussions elsewhere.  Let us tease out the repercussions on the next Stage.  What would be wrong with doing that?  That is what legislating is about.  Our simple request is to be allowed to proceed to the next Stage so that we can highlight and work on the Bill's problems and identify where legislation is required.  If there are other repercussions, let us identify and deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700035#NN00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539787500,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539787500,"counter":305,"content":"<p>The division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 18 October 2018 in accordance with Standing Order 70(2).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700035#NN00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Third Interim Report of the Disclosures Tribunal: Statements","time":1539788100,"counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700036#OO00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1539788100,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who is having an exceedingly busy day, to make his opening statement under Standing Order 45, and he has 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700036#OO00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1539788100,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased the House has decided to set aside time to debate the third interim report of the disclosures tribunal.  I must add, however, that it seems to be a very quiet House compared with the frenzied atmosphere there was around the setting up of the tribunal and associated events last year.  Having read the report in some detail, there is no doubt it is comprehensive and merits careful and close reading.<\/p>  <p>  It is very clear what the report's main findings are and what Mr. Justice Charleton considers should be foremost in our minds in formulating a response to it.  The principal finding relates to the treatment of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  The tribunal has set out in a clear and stark way the ordeal which was endured by Sergeant McCabe and his family.  Many aspects of the report make for very disturbing reading.  What shines through at all times in this report is the courage and incredible resilience of Maurice McCabe and his family.  <\/p>  <p>  As I told the House this morning, since the report was published I have spoken with Sergeant McCabe on the telephone and, on behalf of the State, I apologised to him and his family for the manner in which he was treated over a prolonged period of time.  He was extremely gracious and accepted that apology in the spirit in which it was offered.  I intend to meet Sergeant McCabe in person in the corning weeks and I look forward to those discussions.  I know the entire House joins with me in wishing him and his family well.  My sincere hope is that he, his wife, Lorraine, and their family can now put this horrendous and prolonged ordeal behind them and get on with their lives.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt in my mind that Maurice McCabe has done the State some considerable service.  While this module of the tribunal addressed Sergeant McCabe's situation, the report shines a light on many issues and events, and contains many important lessons for all of us.<\/p>  <p>  I propose to look at the report's main findings and then outline the way forward as I see it.  First, I should once again express my thanks and appreciation to Mr. Justice Charleton for the efficient and effective manner in which he conducted the business of the tribunal and the clarity of his report and the conclusions thereto.<\/p>  <p>  I also offer my thanks to Mr. Justice Sean Ryan, the former President of the Court of Appeal, who will take over the work of the tribunal in relation to the matters covered by the remaining paragraph [p] of its terms of reference.  That paragraph covers any garda who made protected disclosures and who alleged that he or she was subsequently targeted or discredited as a result.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly refer to the background to the matters before the tribunal.  The tribunal arose essentially out of two protected disclosures made by Superintendent David Taylor and Sergeant Maurice McCabe to my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in the autumn of 2016.  Those protected disclosures alleged that a campaign was being run by senior garda&iacute; to discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  Members of the House are sufficiently aware of the details, so let me just say in general terms what these were.  The primary allegations which gave rise to the tribunal related to the alleged use of an entirely false allegation of serious criminal misconduct by Sergeant McCabe and the involvement of Tusla in this regard; allegations that the then Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, sought to use these allegations to discredit Sergeant McCabe at the O'Higgins commission of investigation; and allegations that senior members of the service acted in a manner intended to discredit or traduce Sergeant Maurice McCabe.<\/p>  <p>  I have already said that the report and its findings need to be read carefully but its primary conclusions are very clear.  The report is emphatic in its vindication of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  It states that he is a genuine person who was concerned to maintain standards and that he has done the State considerable service by bringing failures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the attention of the wider public.  Sergeant Maurice McCabe deserves the gratitude of all of us for bringing serious shortcomings to public attention.  As I said, I have spoken with Sergeant McCabe and I will meet him shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The report finds that an error made in preparing a report on allegations against Sergeant McCabe was allowed to remain uncorrected.  This was a Tusla issue and will be addressed later in the debate by my colleague, the  Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  No one before the O'Higgins commission of investigation ever accused Sergeant McCabe of any crime, hinted at it or engaged in any innuendo about it.  The tribunal found that both former Commissioner Martin Callinan and Superintendent David Taylor had not been truthful in the matter of their evidence.  The tribunal accepts the evidence of my predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, that she decided not to interfere following the email of 15 May 2015 informing her that an issue had arisen at the commission of investigation.  The report emphasises that her response was a considered one.<\/p>  <p>  On a personal basis, I would like to say that Deputy Frances Fitzgerald is a loss to the Cabinet and I do not believe her resignation served any public interest, though it may have served the political interests of some people and parties in this House.  I hope to see the Deputy returned to high office in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to the tribunal&rsquo;s central findings, it accepted that the former Minister did not speak with the former Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan.  It finds that in fact no situation requiring intervention by then Minister occurred before the O'Higgins commission.  A particular allegation was made about my Department's involvement with those transcripts but the report states clearly that the transcripts provided to the tribunal from the O'Higgins commission of investigation are and always were complete despite unfounded media speculation to the contrary.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention former Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan.  The former Commissioner was the subject of a concerted campaign to undermine her position over a period of time, from the leaking of partial and misleading transcripts from the O'Higgins commission right up to the making of the two protected disclosures and even following the setting up of the tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  While I accept that the Oireachtas has a vital role to play in ensuring accountability, it is incumbent on all of us, as elected representatives, not to abuse the responsible positions we hold.  What we expect of others, we should also expect of ourselves.  During her tenure as Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan was frequently before Oireachtas committees.  She was frequently subjected to questions that sometimes crossed the line that divides robust inquiry from personalised attack.  I ask Members who were party to that process to reflect carefully on their behaviour at that time.<\/p>  <p>  In the end, it is clear these allegations, which have been found by the tribunal to be unsupported by evidence, became more than anyone could reasonably bear, particularly in an extremely pressurised, responsible and visible job, which is that of the Garda Commissioner.  The tribunal did not find any evidence that the former Commissioner was party to the calumny visited upon Sergeant McCabe or any wrongdoing on her part in relation to Superintendent Taylor.  It is important, in all the circumstances, that these findings are recorded in the House.  As I did on the occasion of her retirement, I thank former Commissioner O'Sullivan for her service and wish her well in her future endeavours.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, while some members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are revealed by the tribunal to have behaved reprehensively, Mr. Justice Charleton also highlights the diligent arid professional approach taken by many members of the organisation.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, this gives me grounds for optimism for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Charleton raises the fact that this House did not debate his second report dealing with terms of reference (n) and (o) regarding complaints made by Garda Keith Harrison.  Deputies will acknowledge that there can be a level of furore in this House in relation to a matter giving rise to a tribunal that is seldom matched by in-depth analysis on publication of the report, particularly if it makes for uncomfortable reading for Members of the House.  Hence, the fact that there is a mere handful of Deputies here for the start of this debate.  We should not shy away from self-reflection as a Parliament if we are to maintain a healthy democracy.<\/p>  <p>  Garda Harrison and his partner, Marisa Simms, alleged that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the highest level had prevailed on the HSE to intervene in their family affairs as a consequence of the making of protected disclosures by Garda Harrison.  Members will recall the media coverage of these allegations which, put together with Sergeant McCabe's experiences with Tusla, opened the appalling vista of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na colluding with the social services to target members who raised certain issues.<\/p>  <p>  Mr Justice Charleton fully investigated Garda Harrison's allegations.  He finds: \"All of the allegations of Garda Keith Harrison and Marisa Simms examined by the tribunal are entirely without any validity.\"  Mr. Justice Charteton goes on to say: \"It is appropriate here to exonerate everyone in social services and in policing accused by them of discreditable conduct.\"  His words require no further elucidation on my part.  Again, I invite Members of the House who engaged in questioning on this issue to reflect on their statements and allegations.<\/p>  <p>  Let me turn to the future.  I very much welcome the Garda Commissioner's initial response to the report last week.  I will discuss matters raised in detail with Commissioner Harris, assuring him of my support as he addresses the findings in the report.   It is clear there are consequences to be dealt with for individuals and much of that will fall to the Garda Commissioner.  It would not be helpful for me to comment directly on these matters in the course of this debate.  This House must leave any due process that arises to take its course in respect of serving employees.  I assure Deputies that any action required by me or my Department will be followed up speedily and thoroughly.  I will engage directly with the Commissioner in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Charleton also refers to protected disclosures and how they were used in the lead-up to the establishment of the tribunal.  I note that he questions, in particular, if there is a lacuna in the system whereby protected disclosures, which were properly made in accordance with the 2014 Act, are then made available to Members of the Oireachtas and the media where the subjects of the allegations have little or no opportunity to respond. <\/p><p>This has created a situation where those accused are practically considered guilty until proven innocent.  It is an abuse of an Act introduced to protect genuine whistleblowers reporting what they reasonably believed to be genuine wrongs.  This merits consideration and I will raise this with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose Department has carriage of this legislation.<\/p> <p> Mr. Justice Charleton is right when he says that new structures will not of themselves create the culture that would avoid the repetition of bad practice that has been highlighted now in a number of reports on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This requires significant cultural change, embedding consistent good practices and conscientious supervision by those in management ranks.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commissioned an independent organisation culture audit earlier this year for which the auditors spoke to many rank and file garda&iacute;.  The report also highlights many of the issues addressed by the tribunal&rsquo;s report.<\/p> <p> I strongly recommend that anyone with an interest in policing reads the Independent Policing Commission's report from cover to cover.  I am engaged in a consultation process with the Departments and agencies on which the report has had an impact, and I will be returning to Government with a high-level implementation plan in December of this year.  The report specifically recommends new oversight architecture for policing that defines and separates responsibility for governance, oversight and accountability.  It also addresses the critical issue of discipline in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, similar to Mr Justice Charleton, recommends a new disciplinary regime.  GSOC would be replaced by a new complaints body that would handle all complaints against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that raise serious issues about standards of policing or police integrity itself, such as potential breaches of the law, violation of human rights or corruption, or issues that might indicate a widespread or systemic problem within the police.  The implementation plan for the commission's report will take full account of the issues <\/p> <p> I will now return to where I began.  Sergeant Maurice McCabe has done the State a huge service and Mr. Justice Charleton has done likewise, but their service will be for nothing if we do not respond appropriately.  I was greatly taken by the set of obligations on garda&iacute; set out towards the end of the tribunal report.  Garda&iacute; are urged to take pride in their work and their uniform, always be honest, visible and polite, to serve the people, to treat their obligation to the public as superior to any false sense that garda&iacute; should stick up for each other and, finally, to engage in self-analysis.  These are simple values based on doing the right thing, but they are fundamental.  These are the standards that we should all observe, as public servants, as members of this House and as human beings.  They are certainly what the public has a right to expect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> Clearly, there are lessons here for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department, all public bodies, the Government, the Oireachtas and, not least, the media.  A central tenet for all of us is that we must learn how effectively to face up to and determine the truth of allegations while not making the mistake of treating these as facts in all circumstances.  Unfortunately, that was done on more than one occasion in this House over the past 12 months.  Above all, we as a society must respond appropriately to those who speak up to highlight a wrong.  For my part, I am determined that these lessons will be learned and applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700036#OO00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539788700,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I will start by thanking Mr. Justice Charleton and the tribunal team for conducting such an efficient and thorough investigation, as requested by the Houses of the Oireachtas in February 2017.  Mr. Justice Charleton has produced two substantive reports within a period of 20 months, and those reports have categorically answered the questions and issues of urgent public importance that this House asked him to determine.  He has produced reports which are well written, clear, decisive and erudite.  He has done exactly what we asked him to do.  That said, it is important to note the limitations of tribunals of inquiry.  As I said when we were debating the terms of reference back in February 2017, a tribunal of inquiry is just a fact-finding body.  It is not there to determine penalties or to impose sanctions on individuals.  It is simply a fact-finding body to determine what happened.<\/p>  <p>  The Houses of the Oireachtas establishes tribunals of inquiry when there are matters of urgent public importance that the D&aacute;il and Seanad believe merit investigation and report.  When one looks at the tribunals of inquiry that we have had in this country over the past 20 or 30 years, one will note that all of them derived from political controversies.  Many of the political controversies that give rise to tribunals of inquiry originate in this House.  This is true of the beef tribunal, the Flood tribunal, the Moriarty tribunal, the Smithwick tribunal or indeed the disclosures tribunal.  All of the aforementioned emanated from issues of political controversy.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth going back and recalling the political issues that led this House to determine that we needed a public inquiry.  The first was that in September 2016, a superintendent at the Garda press office made a protected disclosure in which he made very serious allegations against the then Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  There was also a protected disclosure made by Sergeant McCabe at that time.  The Government agreed at the time that there needed to be an investigation of those allegations.  At that stage, it was not thought that a tribunal of inquiry was appropriate but that there should be a commission of investigation.<\/p>  <p>  When the terms of the commission of investigation were being drawn up, a second issue arose in February 2017, namely, the broadcasting by RTE of a report on its \"Prime Time\" programme to the effect that Tusla, the child and family agency, had produced a report which contained an allegation against Sergeant McCabe that was 100% false.  It suggested that Sergeant McCabe had been involved in criminal activity for which no allegation had ever been made against him.  Mr. Justice Charleton, on page 33 of his report, says that it \"was justifiable for the people of Ireland to suspect at the time of the setting up of this tribunal in early 2017 that the ostensible capacity to destroy members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercised by Garda Headquarters extended even to using national social services for that end.\"  I recall that in February 2017 there was legitimate concern, not just on the Opposition benches but within Government, that there had been a campaign against Sergeant McCabe that resulted in the social services being used to defame him.  That was the second reason for members of this House deeming it appropriate to establish a tribunal of inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  The third issue giving rise to the setting up of a public inquiry was that at the same time, there had been selective publication of one or two pages of the report of the commission of investigation conducted by Mr. Justice O'Higgins which suggested that Sergeant McCabe had been aggressively cross-examined and that the Garda Commissioner had sought to undermine him at that commission.  These were the reasons behind the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.  These were urgent matters of public importance and it is to the benefit of this country and these Houses that we had an inquiry and a report has been produced.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note, however, that the allegations made by Superintendent Taylor against the former Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, were false.  They were untrue allegations but at the time there was a lot of pressure on people to say that N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan should resign because of them.  Fianna F&aacute;il did not say that she had to resign.  We said that she was entitled to defend herself against those allegations.  The lesson this House should learn from this is that if serious allegations are made against individuals and if those individuals deny them, they are entitled to defend themselves.  If the allegations are sufficiently serious, then we set up a public or private inquiry to determine where the truth lies.<\/p>  <p>  On the issues involving Tusla, Mr. Justice Charleton is very clear.  He says that the copy and paste mistake, whereby part of a report about a different individual was inserted into Sergeant McCabe's report, was \"an unbelievable coincidence\" but despite its bizarre nature, it was a \"genuine mistake\".  My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, will speak in due course about Tusla, but we should reflect on the fact that Mr. Justice Charleton referred to what went on in that organisation as constituting \"shocking administrative incompetence\".  That is a fairly damning condemnation of a State agency and, as policymakers, we need to determine what must be done in respect of it.<\/p><p> The second part of the allegations made by Superintendent Taylor was that there was a campaign against Sergeant McCabe, who also made this complaint.  There was a campaign against Sergeant McCabe.  It did not involve N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, but it did involve the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan.  The most deeply disturbing aspect of the report is that it reaches a finding that a Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na used his office and power to repulsively denigrate Sergeant McCabe.  It is wholly inappropriate for a Garda Commissioner to launch an attack on a member of the Garda force in that way. <\/p> <p> When people heard that Sergeant McCabe had been accused of child abuse, the most serious allegation that could be made against an individual, they were legitimately and genuinely outraged by it.  Some thought that it would constitute criminal behaviour.  It does not.  The only remedy Sergeant McCabe has is his constitutional right to his good name.  The only remedy he can have to rectify the damage is through a defamation action.  I appreciate and acknowledge that the Minister for Justice and Equality today apologised to Sergeant McCabe on behalf of the State.  It was the right thing to do and I commend the Minister for doing so.  Apologies in defamation actions, however, are just words.  Sergeant McCabe is entitled to another remedy, which may be a matter for another day.  The State needs to recognise that its most senior police officer engaged in a campaign of calumny against him, as described by Mr. Justice Charleton, and that campaign of calumny has to be rectified by the State.  <\/p> <p> The other part of the report deals with what happened at the commission of investigation before Mr. Justice O'Higgins.  The terms of reference included wanting to know whether the allegation of sexual abuse had been used against Sergeant McCabe at the commission of investigation.  We had very little to go on, one page, but there were suggestions from other quarters that, in fact, Sergeant McCabe had been aggressively questioned and this allegation had been used against him at the O'Higgins commission of investigation.  We now know from the report of Mr. Justice Charleton that there was no reference to any allegation of sexual abuse at the O'Higgins commission of inquiry and that although the transcript did indicate at the outset that there were instructions on the part of the former Garda Commissioner's senior counsel to challenge the integrity and motivation of Sergeant McCabe, in fact, was a mistake made by counsel representing the former Commissioner, Ms O'Sullivan.  Mistakes happen, which I fully accept, but it was a serious matter which merited investigation.<\/p> <p> I am conscious that the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, got caught up in the issues associated with Sergeant McCabe after we had established the terms of reference for the tribunal of inquiry in February 2017.  In November 2017 information came out which suggested that, in fact, the then Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality had been aware of the Garda strategy being used by the Garda Commissioner in the O'Higgins commission of investigation.  I bear no ill will towards Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I share the Minister's views of her in that I believe she is a very fine politician, but I cannot be insincere and go back and try to recreate what happened in November 2017.  On that occasion, inaccurate incorrect information was given to the D&aacute;il.  There was a requirement for political accountability and, unfortunately for Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, she got caught up in it.  There was nothing personal in it on my part or that of my party, but the difference between the former Minister and the former Commissioner, Ms O'Sullivan, on whom some called to give up her job, is that the former Minister was accountable to this House.  Politicians in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are only accountable to it for utterances in this House; no tribunal of inquiry is entitled to regulate what they state in this House and it was our responsibility.  <\/p> <p> I will now give my colleague, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, some time.  This is an excellent report.  The seven obligations Mr. Justice Charleton has imposed on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be set out.  People at home watching this debate who have not read the report should read it.  There is some great language in it.  I particularly like the story about the penitent who went to confession, but that is a matter for another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700037#PP00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539789300,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Mr. Justice Peter Charleton summarises:<\/p><blockquote>...a rape allegation was conjured out of nowhere [...] When the mistake was discovered nearly a year later in 2014 when Maurice McCabe was even better known, the person who made it did all she could to rectify it.  It was given continued life, notwithstanding her efforts, because of startling inefficiency [and indolence] within social services.  In consequence, serious upset was caused to Maurice McCabe and his wife and family because the rape allegation took on a life of its own and resulted in a letter from TUSLA being delivered to his household accusing him of a rape offence that no one had ever laid against him.<\/blockquote><p>What is profoundly worrying is that Tusla failed on two occasions - in 2006, when it failed to carry out a credibility assessment and interview Sergeant McCabe, and 2013, when Ms D attended Health Service Executive counselling, during which she reported the alleged incident to the counsellor.  The counsellor typed a report on the incident into another report that she had used to detail an incident which had been reported to her by another client.  The result was a jumbled written report that included details and names from Ms D's and Ms Y's allegations.  To an attentive reader, it should have been obvious that there were considerable discrepancies in the document, that it seemed to involve two clients.  This became known as the &quot;cut and paste error&quot; which resulted in a rape allegation being made against Sergeant McCabe.<\/p><p>During the course of the tribunal efforts were made to understand the system used by the HSE and later Tusla to handle child protection cases.  Essentially, the system was based on &quot;measuring the pressure&quot;, whereby high priority and urgent cases were handled immediately.  An example was a child being kept in a cage at home.  For all other cases - medium or low priority cases - files were transferred to a filing cabinet in the Cavan premises.  When a social worker had free time, he or she went and plucked out a file.  According to some social workers, there was system in place to do this chronologically or according to seriousness.  According to others, it was totally random.  The tribunal is satisfied that there was no system in place.  Aside from the ramifications for the Sergeant McCabe case, this amounts to shocking incompetence on the part of Tusla.  In the absence of a proper system to handle child protection cases, files can be left for indefinite periods of time and low priority cases can be handled ahead of medium priority cases.  All of this can result in additional harm being perpetrated against children, in so far as it can result in Tusla failing to act on live cases in a timely fashion.  <\/p><p>Are the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Taoiseach happy or comfortable with Ireland's child protection services?  The tribunal of inquiry is a fact-finding body and it is not for it to oversee any reform or changes on foot of its findings.  Implementation of changes on foot of the conclusions made in the report is a matter for the Government and we hope steps will be taken without delay to implement reform.  Does the House agree that it is time we had a branch and root review of Tusla?  It is not all a question of a shortage of social workers or management.  It is a matter of checks and balances, responsibility and accountability and protecting vulnerable children.  It is also a question of protecting claimants.  It is obvious in reading the report that the system in Tusla is broken and in need of review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700038#QQ00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1539789300,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Sergeant Maurice McCabe is now a household name in Irish society.

It stated &quot;Maurice McCabe has done the State considerable service by bringing these matters to the attention of the wider public and he has done so not out of a desire to inflate his public profile, but out of a legitimate drive to ensure that the national police force serves the people through hard work and diligence.&quot;  It further found, quite remarkably, that he was &quot;repulsively denigrated for being no more than a good citizen and police officer&quot; and subject to a campaign of calumny.  These are very strong findings which highlight the seriousness of what was at foot and the implications and impact it had for Sergeant McCabe and his family.<br\/><br\/>It was truly extraordinary that the most senior garda in the State would denigrate in such a horrid and malevolent way a man whose only crime was to highlight wrongdoing in that organisation.  If the conclusions that Mr. Justice Charleton has arrived at were stated at the time, in 2012, it is likely that they would have been dismissed as a phantom and practically impossible.  Unfortunately, it has proven to be a reality.<br\/><br\/>I thank Mr. Justice Charleton for his sterling work on this tribunal and wish the best of luck to Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan, who will handle the final module, on term of reference (p).  My party and I accept the findings and the recommendations contained in this report.  I think we can all agree that when the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe came into the public domain in 2012, we were shocked but perhaps not so surprised.  A few months later, he lifted the lid on the penalty points controversy.  This became the catalyst for the real challenge that faced Sergeant McCabe.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, and disgracefully, the response by the institution of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not to reflect upon these failings, see how they might be resolved, and how to support Sergeant McCabe, but to round on him and treat him as a nuisance to be ignored, marginalised and perhaps even vilified.  Such feelings of disdain manifested themselves and were made overtly public by the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, when he went before the Committee of Public Accounts and proceeded to tell it that only two officers out of a force of 13,000 were making allegations of wrongdoing, and that on a personal level he found that to be quite disgusting.  The then Assistant Garda Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan stated subsequently that this wording was unfortunate as if to imply it was a mere slip when it is clear now that it was anything but.  This specific and select choice of words spoke to a wider culture of how whistleblowers were perceived within the force at the time, and the greater perception that their loyalty to the force had been breached, rather than commending their loyalty to the public which is their first and foremost duty.<br\/><br\/>While that is a mere six years ago, or less than that, so much has developed and emerged since then that it seems like a different era.  So many controversies have unfortunately enveloped An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that it seems hard now to imagine a Commissioner attempting to pass it off as a triviality and fringe issue.  That came from a man who we now know was central to the concerted attempt to do down Sergeant McCabe.  I also commend Garda John Wilson who stood by Sergeant McCabe's claims and publicly supported him when the easier thing to do would have been to disappear into the background of the story.<br\/><br\/>Jumping forward to May 2016, days after the O'Higgins report was published, further leaks revealed that Commissioner O'Sullivan's legal team had a strategy of attacking Sergeant McCabe's motivation and integrity during the inquiry.  Mr. Justice Charleton found last week that this strategy was legally proper, which is his remit.  Former Commissioner O'Sullivan and Deputy Frances Fitzgerald are entitled to point to that.  I remain unconvinced whether it was wise or whether it was consistent with the approach adopted by the former Commissioner of being supportive, legally and otherwise, of whistleblowers.  It remains my view that such a strategy should ideally not have been embarked upon, particularly when based, as it transpired, on a mistranscription or a miscommunication of the letter of 18 May regarding complaints made to Superintendent Clancy.  It is unfortunate that urgent requests to engage with counsel following the row with the commission, given the context outlined above, were not followed.  Mr. Justice Charleton came to that conclusion himself in page 153 of the report where he stated:<\/p><blockquote>The balance of the evidence is to the effect that Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan was urgently requested to engage with counsel over the weekend following the row but that for whatever unexplained reason, she was not prepared to do so.  The tribunal cannot accept her evidence in that regard.<\/blockquote><p>In June 2016, Tusla wrote to Sergeant McCabe, confirming that no allegation of digital penetration had been made against him.  Sergeant McCabe requested of Tusla that all copies of records made on him and his family be released to him.  In 2006, a complaint was made against Sergeant McCabe of sexual impropriety with a colleague's daughter, known as Ms D, about eight years earlier.  The Director of Public Prosecutions ordered no prosecution and social services directed no further action.  The report states: &quot;That should have been the end of any allegation that Maurice McCabe had ever sexually assaulted a child.&quot;  Mr. Justice Charleton found:<\/p><blockquote>The false report had an afterlife within TUSLA.  This was not due to any action by garda&iacute;, but was because of the astounding inefficiency of that organisation.<\/blockquote><p>He found that if Tusla had owned up to accusing Sergeant McCabe mistakenly of rape, there would likely have been no need for the disclosures tribunal.  It was within a week of these allegations coming into the public domain that the tribunal was established.<br\/><br\/>There are major questions for Tusla, which no longer has the excuse of being a new organisation.  It has been on the ground for a number of years.  It was dealing with historical issues.  Social services have long been a problem in this State but, unfortunately, Tusla still seems to lurch from crisis to crisis.  Some of these issues are resource related but it is clear that resources are not an explanation for all these problems.  We need to look seriously at social services and to develop a strategy for their improvement, for investment, and for retention of social workers.  Unfortunately, at the minute, it is only paid attention as crises arise.  The most recent significant one related to Geoffrey Shannon's report into section 12 cases.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Justice Charleton ruled there was no conspiracy behind the mix-up, stating, &quot;This must be one of the most unlikely coincidences ever to be accepted by any judicial tribunal. Yet, coincidence it was.&quot;  He accepted evidence by HSE staff member, Laura Brophy, about how she made the mistake and called it an horrendous coincidence.  Mr. Justice Charleton said Tusla was slow to respond to the public request for co-operation with the disclosures tribunal, which is a worrying finding, and I hope it will be questioned further by the Minster, Deputy Zappone, and the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.<br\/><br\/>I can only imagine the hurt caused to Garda McCabe by such a catastrophic series of errors, with allegations of the most serious and disgusting of crimes dogging him and his family for many years to come.  For former Garda Commissioner Callinan apparently to take advantage of that atmosphere to discredit Maurice McCabe is the lowest of the low and, to use the phrase, disgusting.  This was the most senior garda in the State, trying to make out that a prominent whistleblower was guilty of such crimes, dragging his name through the mud.  Any such individual has no place in any workplace, never mind at the top of one of the most powerful organisations in the State, and the damage which he has done to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take many years to repair.<br\/><br\/>Superintendent Taylor is also damaged by this report.  His allegations could be explained as some internalised guilt or such.  It is difficult to rationalise but it is clear that it was a back covering exercise rather than being motivated by transparency and justice.  I noted this morning that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, offered what I believe was a sincere apology to Sergeant Maurice McCabe, and that he will meet him in the near future to reiterate his apologies on behalf of the State.  I welcome that.<br\/><br\/>I note that there has been much commentary in recent days on the events that took place here last November.<\/p><p>It is important that, while we have entrusted Mr. Justice Charleton to make an adjudication on the facts and on legal elements of the various related controversies, it is not for him to adjudicate on the political handling of events and the political response to them.  The criticism made against the Government, and against Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, were not legal, but political criticisms.  It was well documented at the time as to the reason Deputy Fitzgerald lost the confidence of the D&aacute;il, and why motions of confidence were tabled.  To quote Michael Clifford in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner:<\/i><\/p><blockquote>She had to resign because she misrepresented the extent of her knowledge about what went on in 2015, she was slow in answering legitimate questions, her briefing to the Taoiseach saw him mislead the D&aacute;il, and her Department failed to discover important documents to the disclosures tribunal.<\/blockquote><p>The performance of the Government at the time was less than what we would expect and for the sake of clarity it is worth reflecting on some of those points.  On 9 November 2017, following a number of parliamentary questions from Deputy Kelly, the Department located the email sent on 15 May 2015, which had not been discovered despite two thorough searches for all information pertaining to McCabe having been done for the scoping exercise by Mr. Justice O'Neill and the disclosures tribunal.  On 14 November 2017 the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il the T&aacute;naiste had no prior knowledge of the legal strategy of the Garda Commissioner's legal team.  On 16 November 2017, the T&aacute;naiste was informed of said email, one which she has maintained she had forgotten, and she did not inform the Taoiseach despite him having provided false information to the D&aacute;il two days previously.  On 20 November 2017, the media broke the story that the said email had been found.  The Taoiseach got first sight of that at 11 p.m. and it was claimed that Deputy Fitzgerald informed the Taoiseach earlier in the afternoon of that day.  On 21 November 2017 the Taoiseach faced Leaders' Questions and corrected the record, informing the D&aacute;il that the T&aacute;naiste had been informed of the email a year before the public, so she had prior knowledge.  She had said she was aware of the row at the tribunal but said she did not have prior knowledge.  On 22 November 2017 it emerged that the T&aacute;naiste was aware of the strategy three days before Sergeant McCabe was questioned, and she failed to act in any way.  That was borne out by an email.<br\/><br\/>It is a matter of public record that the Taoiseach corrected the D&aacute;il on numerous occasions on the days leading up the eventual resignation of Deputy Fitzgerald.  It was on the back of that mess that Deputy McDonald said there was now a question about the &quot;judgment and credibility of the T&aacute;naiste and the Government&quot;.  Deputy Fitzgerald is entitled to point to the fact that she acted truthfully and honestly at the tribunal.  I bear her no ill will.  I believe she is a decent woman and achieved something in the Department of Justice and Equality, for example, the Domestic Violence Bill, which she initiated and which was subsequently carried through by the current Minister.  However, there is no question in my mind that the affair was mishandled.  The D&aacute;il was given the wrong story too many times, and the political decision was taken to put forward a motion of no confidence.  As has been stated, it is the domain of this House to consider matters of political judgment.  There was not confidence in the Minister and how this affair was handled by the Government, and the process was merely a formality.<br\/><br\/>I commend Mr. Justice Charleton on his report.  A considerable amount of information was collated and assessed in what was, relative to the scope of the material and evidence, quite a short period of time.  The obligations outlined for the Garda are well worth reading for any member of the public.  It is an evocation of what we want to see in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and what we hope for.  In some ways the report could be considered a companion piece to the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland given the vision outlined for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>I again congratulate Sergeant McCabe for putting his head above the parapet and, despite many attempts to discredit him, doing so with his head held high, knowing that he was fighting to do what was right and just.  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in I wish to state that we consider his actions heroic.  We hope he has changed for the better the future direction of policing in this country.  We wish him, his wife Lorraine and his family good luck going forward, and hope they get a well-deserved rest after many arduous years of struggle and that there is finally vindication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700038#QQ00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539790500,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Mr. Justice Charleton described sitting through the hearings in Dublin Castle as a dispiriting exercise.  For those of us who have done so, reading his report is equally dispiriting.  As Mr. Justice Charleton wrote, \"Every judge is conscious that the task of judging others is a human function.  As such, it is fallible.\"  The judge will therefore understand that I do not share his every opinion as expressed in this report, particularly on matters of political accountability.  However, I do believe that it is an impressive exercise in arriving at the truth on factual issues and in securing answers that were previously hidden from us.<\/p>  <p>  I want to concentrate on three aspects that most immediately concern us as public representatives.  I start with the controversy surrounding Deputy Fitzgerald, even though it is far from being the most important aspect of this affair, but we need to get it out of the way.  As has been pointed out by others this week, here and in the media, her Government colleagues have attempted to use the report in order to exonerate Deputy Fitzgerald of a charge of which she was not accused.  As a Government member and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald's primary responsibility was to account fully and accurately to this House for the performance of her functions.  The reason she resigned was not because of anything that happened in 2015.  I want to be fair to Deputy Fitzgerald because we all hold her in high regard on a personal basis.  The reason she resigned was because of what happened in 2017.  Deputy Fitzgerald resigned last November because the D&aacute;il was misled about her knowledge of issues at the O'Higgins commission that took place in May 2015.  I repeat that this is an issue of political, rather than legal, accountability, best assessed by the Members of this House.<\/p>  <p>  What is now clear about the issue at the O'Higgins hearings in May 2015 is that the Chief State Solicitor's team considered it to be \"political dynamite\" and Commissioner O'Sullivan considered that she was in an \"almost impossible dilemma\".  The Department and then the Minister were notified about what was going on.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, acknowledged that she must have read the email sent to her about it.  She decided not to intervene, and Mr. Justice Charleton believes this was correct.  We have no quarrel with that, although, carefully, the judge did not say that a Minister could never intervene in such circumstances.  He expressly left it open that a Minister would be fully justified in intervening if in fact false allegations of sexual abuse had been deployed before Mr. Justice O'Higgins, in order to unfairly traduce Maurice McCabe.  In any event, in November 2017 my colleague, Deputy Kelly, submitted parliamentary questions about what was known about all of this in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The answers he received were vague and unhelpful, but he persisted.  He might, truthfully, have been told in reply that the Minister was aware of the issue but had decided on legal and official advice not to interfere.  Instead, officialdom behaved as if it had something to hide, and as we subsequently found out it did.  The Taoiseach was briefed by his Minister and told the D&aacute;il that the Minister, \"found out about it [the legal strategy] after the fact, but around the time it was in the public domain when everybody else knew about it as well\".  That simply was not true and the subsequent trawl of emails in the Department showed it was not true.  Then, to top it all, we discovered that the emails had not been sent to the tribunal, ten months after it had been appointed.  The Minister resigned the following day.  The D&aacute;il had been misled about the nature and extent of her knowledge of a matter of live public controversy.  In the atmosphere of last November, there was no alternative to the step she took.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700040#SS00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1539790500,"counter":317,"content":"<p>That is the understatement of the century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700040#SS00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1539790500,"counter":318,"content":"<p>The then Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, was in charge of the \"dysfunctional\" Department of Justice and Equality, as the Taoiseach called it.  The Charleton tribunal had asked everyone to provide full documentation to it, but subsequently the Department had to provide multiple boxes of newly discovered information.  Nothing in the report published this week points to a vindication in relation to a charge of failing to account fully and accurately to the D&aacute;il.  We all have a certain responsibility here.  As Members of the D&aacute;il, we each have a responsibility in that regard.<\/p><p>Another point directly concerns us as public representatives.  Members should be slow to blow our own trumpets but I do not think there will be a rush of journalistic commentators or others queueing up to make the point clear.  In his report, Mr. Justice Charleton rejects the sworn evidence of two Garda Commissioners and other senior Garda officers.  The evidence of the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality is rejected as &quot;improbable&quot;.  The evidence of Tusla staff is described as &quot;wholly unconvincing&quot;.  The tribunal listed six cases where journalists flatly contradicted each other in evidence, although Mr. Justice Charleton had to decide the truth in only two of those cases.  In fact, there is only one class of witness whose evidence on all matters of serious contention was accepted by the tribunal.  That class consists of the Members of the D&aacute;il who gave evidence.  On all the factual issues about which they gave evidence the tribunal accepted what was said.  The class includes Deputy Frances Fitzgerald but also Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin, John McGuinness, John Deasy, Mick Wallace, Clare Daly, the former Deputy, Pat Rabbitte, and my party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin.<br\/><br\/>The report contains a final chapter of recommendations.  We need to return to them and consider them in detail, perhaps in committee.  The tribunal outcome points above all to the importance of this House and its Members as a means of securing accountability from Government and agencies of the State.  It demonstrates the importance of persistence, refusing to accept the official line, listening to outsiders and banging again and again at the closed doors until they open up and let in some light.  This was a real exercise in the separation of powers between D&aacute;il and Government.  It was an exercise in Deputies using their privileged position to ensure the issue would not go away.  They kept advancing it until a formal inquiry became inevitable and necessary.  This is how accountability in a mature democracy is meant to work.<br\/><br\/>The tribunal report demonstrates how much we still have to learn about accountability.  Let us consider this passage, for example, from page 112:<\/p><blockquote>From 2016, no one within TUSLA considered owning up to the serious mistakes that had been made.  The solicitors&rsquo; letter of complaint on Maurice McCabe&rsquo;s behalf, sent in response to the letter from TUSLA received in January 2016, was an invitation to give a proper explanation of what had happened.  Had that happened, had TUSLA senior management sat down and read the file and then forthrightly replied setting out fully the mistakes that they had made, this tribunal of inquiry would most probably have been avoided.<\/blockquote><p>There are shades of CervicalCheck here in the sense of the need for an open disclosure policy, one of setting out fully and forthrightly the mistakes that have been made.<br\/><br\/>One final aspect that needs highlighting is the impact of what we have learned from Mr. Justice Charleton on our response to the recommendations of the O'Toole Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Maurice McCabe affair demonstrates the importance of external oversight by the D&aacute;il of the Government and its Departments and agencies.  We need to improve the capacity for oversight and to make it far more effective, but the same lesson must be learned with regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  For decades my party has called for an external Garda oversight agency.  We were determined to break the secretive and damaging relationship between the force and the Department of Justice and Equality.  That relationship was vividly demonstrated in the report by the flurry of telephone calls at senior level between the Phoenix Park and St Stephen's Green at times of crisis.  These were calls which no one could later remember making or receiving.  Their content was immediately forgotten once the line went dead.<br\/><br\/>My party was determined to secure effective Garda accountability and oversight to an independent external body.  We achieved most of what we wanted when the Policing Authority was finally established.  That body, under its chairperson, Josephine Feehily, has lived up to most of our expectations, although there are improvements that can be made to the legislation.  That is why it is, to use Mr. Justice Charleton's term, so dispiriting to see now a recommendation to disband the Policing Authority as an external body securing oversight and to replace it instead with an in-house board of management.  An in-house board will of necessity become ingrained with an in-house policing mentality.  If we have learned anything from this tribunal, it is that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs far less, not more, of an in-house policing mentality.  Members of the force need to be required to demonstrate fully and in public that they live up to the same basic standards of fairness, decency and common sense that bind the rest of us.  As Mr. Justice Charleton put it on page 294:<\/p><blockquote>Central to those issues is a mentality problem.  Where a problem occurs, strongly self-identifying organisations can have a self-protective tendency.  That, regrettably, also describes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is beyond a pity that it took independent inquiries to identify obvious problems with what Maurice McCabe was reporting.<\/blockquote><p>Why on earth would we react to these findings and comments by shunting accountability back inside the force and abolishing outside oversight and scrutiny?  If the Government and the D&aacute;il accept that flawed recommendation from the O'Toole commission, then we will show that we have learned nothing from the McCabe affair or the Charleton report.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs better structures of management.  The number of bodies and agencies that surround it may need to be rationalised, but that must not be at the expense of the important principle - one Mr. Justice Charleton has taught us again - that policing demands accountability.  As he put it on page 292:<\/p><blockquote>A police force is an aspect of the entitlement of a sovereign nation to control its citizens through the rule of law.  It exercises primary law enforcement.  It is entitled to use force and may be armed.  Where respect for the truth fades within such an organisation, where structures of command and accountability break down, and where the police do not offer a complete day of work in exchange for being remunerated by the taxpayer, an essential component of a modern country ceases to function properly.  Police action may become fitful, inefficient or even dishonest.  This helps no one.<br \/><br \/>This tribunal has been about calling that police force to account.  The Morris Tribunal was about the same thing.  The commission of investigation conducted by Mr Justice Kevin O&rsquo;Higgins, which reported to the Minister for Justice and Equality on 25 April 2016, was about the same thing.  Central to these inquiries has been the truth.<\/blockquote><p>This is not the time to consider abolishing any body whose function is to demand openness, accountability and the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700040#SS00400","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539791100,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I do not have enough time to do justice to Mr. Justice Charleton and his team, who have done a great public service.  I had the good fortune to attend the tribunal on several occasions.  I was struck by Mr. Justice Charleton's patience, sharp intellect and wit.  Some people have said he has indulged himself a little in this report.  He was perfectly entitled to do so given some of the nonsense he had to sit through and listen to.<\/p>  <p>  The Charleton report is a searing indictment of several State institutions, in particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla, and the media.  Mr. Justice Charleton castigated a number of journalists for frustrating the work of the tribunal and the public will.  He castigated the public relations companies, which he has characterised, correctly as far as I am concerned, as a hideous development in Irish public life given the domination of spin.<\/p>  <p>  In some ways, we could say Mr. Justice Charleton has probably been a little polite in his language regarding some of the individuals who appeared before him.  The implications are clear, however.  Many of those who gave evidence at the tribunal need what Mr. Justice Charleton referred to as a cultural shift that requires respect for the truth.  In other words, he was told a whopping amount of lies.<\/p>  <p>  The disclosures tribunal was established publicly to find the truth and Mr. Justice Charleton has laid bare a vast amount.  This report is a real education for the people in that regard.  First and most important is the total vindication Mr. Justice Charleton has given to Maurice McCabe.  This cannot be understated.  Sergeant McCabe is a fine policeman and a man of integrity who was repulsively denigrated.  The best thing about how Mr. Justice Charleton handled Maurice McCabe is that there are no ifs or buts.<\/p><p>This was crucial for Maurice and his family, for his wife Lorraine and his father, the two rocks who stood behind him on this very difficult road.<\/p> <p> I am delighted that everybody is patting Maurice on the back now and that he is the people's hero, but it was not always so.  Mr. Justice Charleton pinpointed that \"The facts do not amount to an exoneration of the garda&iacute; in their treatment of Maurice McCabe\".  He said that his complaints generated considerable animosity, which continued over years.  The station was divided.  People did not want to get involved.  A total of 430 former and current senior garda&iacute; were written to by the tribunal.  Only two replied, and not one of them ever heard anything derogatory about Maurice McCabe.  That is improbable, to use Mr. Justice Charleton's words.  He said that when Maurice was \"seeking a better level of policing standards, there were plenty of people who said there was nothing wrong\".  I absolutely know that is the case.  Arguing that was a long and lonely place in the early years, and while the terms of reference concentrated on particular aspects, it was never supposed to be a definitive account of policing in Ireland.  In many ways, Mr. Justice Charleton picked up on this at the Committee of Public Accounts, which was the culmination in some ways of the first round.  It was not the start of this issue but came on the back of approximately two years of raising issues in this House.<\/p> <p> Mr. Justice Charleton has dealt with the issues very well.  We do not have the time to go through all of them but, in terms of the former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I note the Taoiseach tweeted that we should apologise to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  Neither I nor Deputy Wallace joined the baying hyenas here this time last year who were looking for the head of the then Minister.  We made many points over the years about her handling of issues in the Department of Justice and Equality but not about people coming up in 2017 supposedly criticising her for knowledge she had in 2015 of the Commissioner's dealings at the O'Higgins commission, knowledge they all had in 2016 and did not do anything about.  I do not believe I need to give an apology in that respect.<\/p> <p> What those emails did show, however, is that what was going on at the O'Higgins tribunal was not normal.  It was a big deal.  There were emails, calls and frantic efforts to contact the Commissioner, and while Mr. Justice Charleton did not find that N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan relied on false sex abuse allegations to discredit Maurice at the O'Higgins commission, we never said that she did or believed that she did.  What was being said, however, and what was shown was that evidence was being produced at the O'Higgins commission to question his motivation.  We had the words of Colm Smyth and, critically, the letter of 18 May and the complaint against Superintendent Michael Clancy.  While Mr. Justice Charleton said that the letter \"went off the rails\" and that it was strange, he put it down to a mistake.  Ultimately for him, the only issue was whether that had anything to do with N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, and as other people said it had not, he did not want to go there, but it still happened.  For me, it is convenient to put it down to a mistake.  What would have happened if Maurice had not had the tape?<\/p> <p> People talk about poor N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, and I note the Taoiseach referred to people who precipitated her early demise.  We are a long time on the record as saying that N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan did not go quickly enough.  That is nothing personal.  She should never have been appointed in the first place but did she hear about Templemore?  Did she hear anything about false breath tests, the treatment of other whistleblowers or any of that good stuff, all of which was going on in the background?<\/p> <p> While Mr. Justice Charleton accurately stated that she had no hand, act or part to play in the campaign of the then Commissioner, Martin Callinan, and Dave Taylor, that is not the same as saying that she had no case to answer.  In fact, he did not accept her evidence on the lack of engagement with her legal counsel or on her dealings with Noel Waters, whose evidence he did not accept either.  He went on to make many comments contrary to her evidence, that her evidence was disappointing and so on.  He also talked about it being improbable that she could not but have known what was being said about Maurice McCabe and, in essence, did nothing in that regard.<\/p> <p> The report accurately condemns the then Commissioner, Martin Callinan, and Dave Taylor.  That has been well aired, but they were not the only ones involved.  A number of retired garda&iacute; were criticised as being inappropriate and extraordinary in their behaviour, including Assistant Commissioner Kenny, Superintendent McGinn and Chief Superintendent Sheridan, but what about serving members?  Detective Superintendent O'Reilly was promoted since the tribunal started, but Mr. Justice Charleton is quite critical that his decision to introduce Paul Williams to the D family caused further and completely unjustified pain.  What will be done to him?  What will be done to John Barrett, the head of human resources, whose evidence was described by Mr. Justice Charleton as preposterous?  He said he was not satisfied that the conversations alluded to by John Barrett, allegedly with Cyril Dunne, ever took place.  He did not believe his evidence in terms of Maurice McCabe either.  That is very serious stuff.<\/p> <p> I refer to the false rape case being an unbelievable coincidence.  I accept fully the judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton on that.<\/p> <p> Rian counselling service came out well in the report but, my God, what an indictment of Tusla.  The report refers to error upon error, complete misinformation, and files being randomly selected.  Mr. Justice Charleton said it was not a coincidence that Tusla opened Maurice McCabe's file.  They filleted a file that went to the historical sex abuse team and replaced the file when it came back.  Those are points we do not have time to deal with.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Justice Charleton said he had a dreadful struggle to uncover the truth.  I believe he uncovered an incredible amount of it.  He said it is a cultural and an attitude problem and that reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and coming up with new structures will not deal with it.  I agree with him on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700041#TT00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539791700,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I have read the report.  I would like to have an hour to make my contribution but I have only a few minutes.  On 8 June, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton said \"I know that an awful lot of people haven't been telling me the truth\".  I welcome Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s report.  He had a very difficult job.  He said it was a dreadful struggle, but he has done incredibly well.<\/p>  <p>  We attended more than 25 of the 102 days of the tribunal hearings.  Chris Noonan, my parliamentary assistant, attended most days.  At times, it was a depressing experience.  It was hard to listen to public servants, in some cases retired Secretaries General, and Garda Commissioners, take the stand and be so economical with the truth.<\/p>  <p>  I have no intention of being critical of Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s report.  It is excellent.  While he was merciless in much of his report, and rightly so - he certainly did not spare Tusla or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na organisation - there were times when I thought his kind nature got the better of him.<\/p>  <p>  With any tribunal or commission of investigation, before one looks at the final report, one must look at the terms of reference and analyse how these may confine what the judge can examine.  Aside from being limited by the terms of reference, things were made immensely more difficult for him on this occasion due to the fact that so many people refused to tell the truth.<\/p>  <p>  Former press officer David Taylor was not spared, and rightly so.  Mr. Justice Charleton is someone we have come to admire very much, and one of his more admirable features is his intolerance for those blatantly lying to him.  David Taylor was one of them.<\/p>  <p>  Both I and Deputy Clare Daly met David Taylor in his living room shortly after he made his protected disclosure.  Just why he decided to go into the tribunal and give a different version of events from that which he had given us is beyond us.  It was a serious mistake on his part, and he has paid a high price for it.<\/p>  <p>  When the former Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Noel Waters, stated that he could not remember a 14 minute phone call between himself and N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan during the O'Higgins commission, Mr. Justice Charleton referred to it as improbable.  It was more than improbable.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Charleton lambasted David Taylor with his ridiculous excuses regarding the two phones he did not cough up, so to speak.  I would have liked him to grill N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan about the five phones she refused to cough up.<\/p>  <p>  Maurice McCabe requested a tribunal so that events would be examined in public rather than in private.  He was right to do so.  Mr. Justice Cooke is investigating NAMA&rsquo;s sale of Project Eagle.  I can only imagine the lies he is being told.  Obviously, Mr. Justice Charleton was told buckets of lies too, but it was in public, and the difference is that the public got the opportunity to see it.  The Charleton tribunal has lifted the lid on how the establishment has no problem with lying.<\/p>  <p>  He has been slightly written out of history but people forget that Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill was originally tasked with examining the disclosures of David Taylor and Maurice McCabe.  He recommended that a commission of investigation be set up and drafted the terms of reference, the majority of which were used by the tribunal.  The ones he did not draft caused the most trouble, in particular, term of reference (e), which tasked Mr. Justice Charleton with examining the O&rsquo;Higgins commission and whether false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds were inappropriately relied upon by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan to discredit Sergeant McCabe.  That was too narrow, and it did not allow Mr. Justice Charleton to examine some of the other critical issues that played out during the O'Higgins commission.  He was only allowed assess N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan's role in regard to the O&rsquo;Higgins commission, specifically whether she used a false allegation of rape to discredit Maurice.  We never alleged that or believed N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan to be guilty of it.  We did allege many other things, and with good reason.<\/p>  <p>  The famous letter of 18 May handed to the commission setting out the motivations of Maurice McCabe has fallen through the cracks.<\/p><p>Mr. Justice Charleton said it was accurate to a point and then it went off the rails.  It is much worse than that; it is a pure work of fiction.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the letter of 18 May, Mr. Justice Charleton found that there was no deliberate attempt to write a series of quite silly mistakes by way of a submission undermining Maurice McCabe to the O&rsquo;Higgins commission.  I beg to differ.  If mistakes were made and accepted, why did they always go against Maurice McCabe?  If Chief Superintendent Rooney and Superintendent Cunningham had nothing to hide with regard to their input into the letter, why did they claim privilege in respect of it when they were before the tribunal?<br\/><br\/>With regard to the role of N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan in the smear campaign, Mr. Justice Charleton found that she had no role in it, but also found that it was improbable that she did not know it was happening.  I would have liked him to build on that finding.  A deputy commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a duty of care to all of its officers, and N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan knew what Commissioner Callinan was doing, yet she failed to act.<br\/><br\/>As I said, there was much that Mr. Justice Charleton could not comment on due to the terms of reference, and that is a pity.  There has been a rewriting of history by both the media and the political establishment with regard to the story of Garda malpractice and how the issues came to light.  This Chamber was a lonely place in 2012 and 2013 when we were highlighting the penalty points issues and other Garda wrongdoings.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Justice Charleton referred to the O&rsquo;Mahoney report and stated that the report found no evidence of crime, corruption, deception or falsification.  Obviously, he could not make findings on that report.  Although it is now completely discredited, when the report was published, it was heralded.  The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, went onto the plinth of Leinster House and abused the whistleblowers, and Martin Callinan told the Oireachtas committee that Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney's report was credible and factually correct and that it was based on fact.  That is not true.  Those lines were accepted by the media at the time without any scrutiny and our protestations were rubbished.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Justice Charleton also touched upon a letter Chief Superintendent Rooney passed around to local garda&iacute; in the Cavan-Monaghan division in 2011, congratulating everyone involved in the Byrne-McGinn inquiry on their good work.  Chief Superintendent Rooney apologised for this letter at the tribunal and Mr. Justice Charleton stated that the apology was belated.  It was more than belated; it was a disgrace of a letter.<br\/><br\/>On the media, the Charleton report stated that the tribunal had the greatest difficulty in getting any information from journalists and that journalistic privilege has two parts, the entitlement to assert it and the right of society to override it in the interest of a pressing national concern.  I have not noticed many journalists quoting Mr. Justice Charleton on that.  In terms of the media coverage of the events at Dublin Castle, Olga Cronin from <i>broadsheet.ie<\/i>, Sean Murray of <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>, and Mick Clifford deserve to be singled out for praise.  Some of what was written would certainly have prevented Mr. Justice Charleton from enjoying his breakfast if he had the misfortune to have read it.<br\/><br\/>In his conclusion, Mr. Justice Charleton states that a tribunal, having completed its work, might hope that thereby some improvement could occur.  He states that a tribunal should speak freely and should in no way be trapped by the temptation of cynicism that nothing may change.  I believe that this tribunal was worthwhile.  I believe things will change for the better.  Mr. Justice Peter Charleton has done the State a great service, unlike so many who went up to Dublin Castle to tell him lies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700042#UU00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539792300,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Next is the slot for the Rural Independents.

The Charleton inquiry referred to many players.  In respect of Martin Callinan, the former Garda Commissioner, it found that he had engaged in a campaign of calumny against Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  Mr. Justice Charleton did not accept the former Commissioner's evidence that he had not engaged in a smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe.  That is a very serious finding.  Mr. Justice Charleton upheld the evidence of Deputy John McGuinness, Deputy John Deasy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and journalist, Philip Boucher-Hayes, that Callinan had smeared Sergeant McCabe, repeating false allegations about him.  Mr. Justice Charleton says that the former Commissioner's evidence under oath was found to be unreliable, and that this smear campaign was actively aided by the Garda press officer, Superintendent David Taylor, who had lied to the tribunal and had tried to implicate the former Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, in the smear campaign because he was not promoted but moved to the traffic corps.  Again, these are very serious allegations.  Mr. Justice Charleton was also critical of the culture within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in general.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of former Garda Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, Mr. Justice Charleton found no evidence that she had any hand, act or part in a smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe but found it improbable that she was not aware of such a campaign.  He found no evidence that she instructed her legal team to make unfounded allegations against Sergeant McCabe during the private hearings of the O&rsquo;Higgins commission, which was investigating allegations from Sergeant McCabe into low policing standards in the Cavan-Monaghan division.<\/p>  <p>  Maurice McCabe was vindicated by the tribunal.  Mr. Justice Charleton said he stood up for better standards in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and tried his best to tell the truth at all times.  He suffered for challenging the establishment while demanding better standards and professionalism within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is one of the most important findings of the report.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Charleton harshly criticised Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, accusing it of astounding inefficiency in creating in the first place an error of false accusations of sexual abuse, then not noticing its error of false accusations against Sergeant McCabe, and finally not correcting the error when it was identified.  The error was described by Mr. Justice Charleton as one of the most unlikely coincidences ever to be accepted by a judicial tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Frances Fitzgerald was forced to resign as Minister for Justice and Equality in November 2017.  Mr. Justice Charleton found the accusation that she knew of the alleged Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legal strategy to undermine Sergeant McCabe at the O&rsquo;Higgins commission to be false.  He clearly exonerated the former Minister and found that she had acted properly at all times and had not engaged with former Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan about the matter of the legal strategy at the O&rsquo;Higgins commission, nor allowed Sergeant McCabe to be unjustly treated in any way.  He found that she selflessly decided to resign in the national interest and had been the victim of a political furore, with allegations made by the Opposition which were clearly incorrect and based on misleading leaks from the O&rsquo;Higgins commission.  None of these allegations against Deputy Frances Fitzgerald has been upheld by Mr. Justice Charleton or found to have any foundation.  <\/p>  <p>  What happens in this House is often akin to the wild west in that we shoot first and ask questions later.  What benefit did the resignation of Deputy Fitzgerald bring to Sergeant McCabe&rsquo;s situation?  What benefit did the resignation of Tony O&rsquo;Brien bring to the CervicalCheck controversy?  Will the resignation of Deputy Denis Naughten as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment advance the roll-out of the national broadband plan?  I doubt it very much.  These resignations satisfy the demand for a head for political and media gratification at the time.  Often, however, individuals are later exonerated when the full facts become available.  Calling for resignations is clearly popular but unless the evidence against the person is overwhelming, they should be called for with a large health warning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700043#VV00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1539792300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to say a few words this evening.  I thank Mr. Justice Charleton for his arduous and diligent work on behalf of all of us in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the report issued by Mr. Justice Charleton last week truly bring us back to GUBU territory.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might remember that.  He was around this House and I was an active member of Fianna F&aacute;il at the time.  The findings truly are grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented.  The most senior garda in the State, someone with access to the most sensitive information possible, was found to have conducted a campaign of terror against an innocent member of the rank and file, Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  We have to have sympathy and respect for Sergeant McCabe's family.  This went beyond what we might call the usual spectacle of organisational incompetence or mismanagement.  It was personal and vicious.  The report highlights that beneath the seemingly respectable fa&ccedil;ade of so much of our society, particularly at the higher levels, there is a nauseating level of disregard for the interests of the ordinary person.<\/p><p>Institutions and organisations such as the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, were found to be operating with staggering levels of incompetence, despite being tasked with making decisions on a daily basis that affected families at the most intimate and long-lasting level.<br\/><br\/>We seem to go through this sorry charade every few months.  We come here on the back of yet another damning report and pour out our scorn and anger.  We make solemn promises that nothing like this will be repeated and that safeguards are being put in place, yet time and again we end up right back where we started.  It is shocking.  This is yet another scandal and betrayal by those in power and still nothing changes.<br\/><br\/>I want to read a particular quote:<\/p><blockquote>Corruption can occur in many guises: here it was the abuse of police investigation ... Equally, other forms of corruption, such as looking the other way, bribery, the taking of short cuts in investigations, the construction of cases based upon lies and many other examples can occur at any time.  What is most serious about the situation ...  is the lack of leadership shown by officers at senior level whereby obvious questions were not asked.  In the result, a growing situation of deceit was allowed to blossom to its fullest extent when the application of discipline and the energetic pursuit of proper standards would have snuffed out that growth at an early stage.<\/blockquote><p>That is a direct quote from the Morris tribunal report of 2002.  Sixteen years later we are right back at that place where, as I quoted, a growing situation of deceit was allowed to blossom to its fullest extent when the application of discipline and the energetic pursuit of proper standards would have snuffed out that growth at an early stage.  That is the sad part about it and 16 years later we have a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>That is to say nothing about Tusla.  I have considerable experience of this organisation with respect to grandparents and fostering, even though I accept that the Minister did address the issue in a very co-operative manner.  However, the organisation is not and has not been fit for purpose.  A huge section of it was hived off from the HSE and allowed to do what it liked with whom it liked.  Obviously, there are many good people in it who are called in to deal with many challenging cases of children in awful circumstances.  That is why they need to be more diligent and cautious.  While I am not naming and blaming anyone, it is dreadful that a junior official was so inexperienced or ill-judged as to just copy and paste a most disgusting, awful, false allegation and give it legs and put it out as a vicious and pernicious rumour.  It was then compounded by those at a senior level not taking corrective actions.<br\/><br\/>We have to salute Mr. Justice Charleton and Mr. Justice Morris, but what are we learning from this?  I note that the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has left the Chamber.  I, for one, never called for the resignation of the previous Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I always thought she was being harshly treated and I am delighted that she was vindicated.  I told her so privately and personally at the time.  She went through hell, as did her family, supporters and friends, perhaps all in the pursuit of headlines, but it was very unfair.  We are all entitled to our good name, including Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  One only has it once and if it is denigrated, attacked and challenged, it is a smear.<br\/><br\/>There are many situations throughout the country.  I can speak about a situation in Dungarvan, County Waterford involving Anne Marie O'Brien who has visited Leinster House.  She recently wrote to many Deputies to try to get justice or answers about what happened to her brother and Mr. Patrick Esmond who went fishing off Helvick Head ten years ago.  Their little dinghy was turned upside down and both lives were lost.  There was no meaningful investigation carried out by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, no proper Garda investigation and, above all, there have been no answers to this day.  There have been other cases, including in County Donegal and the case of Fr. Malloy in County Offaly.  There are many cover-ups; it is disgusting.<br\/><br\/>I will not go into detail, but I was dragged into a court case and subject to shabby treatment at Dungarvan Garda station.  Half of the evidence and statements were not sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, only the ones that were used to try to incriminate me.  Several more that supported my view were never sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and there were no answers and no redress.  It cost me a fortune in time, energy and money.  There was an attempt to denigrate me and keep me out of this House in 2007.  It was orchestrated and the worst type of politics.  That is why I supported the Bill which was championed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to change the Judiciary and which included the provision of refresher courses for judges.<br\/><br\/>I always say we need to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At all times 99.9% of the men and women on the beat do their best.  However, we must weed out any distasteful behaviour.  Unfortunately, it seems to come from the top down.  Superintendent Taylor is a constituent of mine.  He comes from a decent family in Cashel, County Tipperary and I believe he is the fall guy.  It is a case of break your boss before you break his orders.  I believe he was doing his duty.  While he erred grievously and was foolish in the extreme, he has to continue with life.  I believe he is the fall guy for many more senior officers.  That is what goes on.  Something that starts with the letter &quot;S&quot; only flows one way and it is down, not up.  We need to support the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and give them the proper tools of the trade.  We need to support the good garda&iacute; - sergeants, inspectors, detectives, the people who go undercover to try to deal with drugs and everything else, up along to superintendents.  However, we need to stop the cavalier expectation and self-serving ideas to try to get to the top in a hurry as it always leads to damage and loss of reputation.  From here they will have to pick up the pieces.<br\/><br\/>I wish the new Garda Commissioner well.  He has some baggage judging from comments he made about previous investigations when two very serious people in Northern Ireland lost their lives across the Border.  I believe he must be supported, but he did not make a good start.  One of the first big statements he came out with was related to the curtailment of overtime.  It will have a massive impact in County Tipperary, further demoralising an already demoralised force.  It needs to have the tools of the trade and the support of senior officials.<br\/><br\/>I will allow Deputy Michael Healy-Rae to take the remaining time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700043#VV00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539792900,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I was actually coming into the Chamber in time for the next debate.

I commend Mr. Justice Charleton on his extraordinary work.<\/p><p>He has done the State an extraordinary service with his report which is wide-ranging.  It is very complimentary to Sergeant McCabe and damning of others.  Most importantly, it draws very clear lessons on a number of public services, how they are organised and the unhealthy culture that underpins some of them which is crying out for reform and needs to be dealt with at the highest level of government, but more about that anon.<br\/><br\/>I also draw attention to the fact that Mr. Justice Charleton instances a number of occasions on which things could have been done differently and states that if they had, there would not have been a need for the tribunal.  I add to those comments by saying that if senior people in government - I include, in particular, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny -  had taken a different attitude to the whistleblowing of Sergeant McCabe from the beginning, there would not have been a need for the tribunal.<br\/><br\/>The most striking aspect of the tribunal is the fact that Mr. Justice Charleton very much endorses a view that many of us and the public at large have of Sergeant McCabe through the finding that he is an entirely genuine person who did the State some service.  The report effectively is a total vindication of his work.  It has found that he &quot;had the interests of the people of Ireland uppermost in his mind&quot;.  That attitude and view of Sergeant McCabe permeates the entire report of the tribunal.<br\/><br\/>We know that, personally, Sergeant McCabe and his wife, Lorraine, and family have been through the most awful time imaginable in recent years and that he was coping with this in the full glare of the media and the public eye.  It is a measure of his strength and that of his wife and family that they were able to withstand and come out of it not just totally vindicated but also as such a strong person and family.  Mr. Justice Charleton refers to this by making the statement that Sergeamt McCabe &quot;remains an officer of exemplary character and ... a person of admirable fortitude,&quot; in spite of all the enormous personal and professional difficulties with which he was faced in recent years.  We, undoubtedly, owe him an enormous debt of gratitude and I think that very heartfelt feeling is shared right around the country for the extraordinary public service he has done.  We can only express our heartfelt thanks and wish him and his family the very best for the future.<br\/><br\/>The Charleton report has found that Sergeant McCabe &quot;was repulsively denigrated for being no more than a good citizen and police officer&quot;.  It has also found: &quot;In investigating the calumny against him, other aspects of our national life have been laid bare&quot;.  These are critical findings of the tribunal.  I note that the Minister for Justice and Equality did not say a huge amount about those other aspects of our national life that have been laid bare.  I would have thought that, one week after the report came out, there would have been a more substantive response from the Government on the huge problems in some public services that have been laid bare in the report.  In that regard, I certainly hope the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will also be responding in this debate on areas within her responsibility.  I have not heard that she is going to do so, but I expect that she will.  It was disappointing to hear the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, earlier.  His contribution fell very far short of what was required in response to the very deep problems and deep dysfunction that Mr. Justice Charleton had found, particularly in the Garda and Tusla.<br\/><br\/>On the severe findings made in the report against individuals, clearly, the stand-out person is the ex-Garda Commissioner Mr. Martin Callinan.  The report has found that he engaged in a deliberate campaign to denigrate and smear Sergeant McCabe.  It has to be said again that action could have been taken at an early stage when the then Commissioner made his infamous &quot;disgusting&quot; remark at the Committee of Public Account.  That was a stand-out moment when action should have been taken, but it was not.  Rather than the matter being dealt with, what we had was a circling of the wagons and senior Government people coming to the defence of the then Commissioner, which clearly was a mistake.  One can say with regard to the deep-seated problems to which Mr. Justice Charleton refers within the Garda, that Mr. Callinan was the embodiment of a lot of them.<br\/><br\/>Equally, it was found that the then press officer, the now retired Superintendent Dave Taylor, who had been hand-picked by Mr. Callinan, had lacked all credibility as a witness.  The report states:<\/p><blockquote>...Superintendent David Taylor is a witness whose credibility was completely undermined by his own bitterness and by the untruthful nature of his affidavit ...  [H]is motivation in bringing forward this allegation was to stop or undermine a criminal investigation rightly being taken against him...<\/blockquote><p>This is very damning of him and also a dreadful reflection on the fact that he was the person who had been chosen to operate as the front person for the Garda.  That was an extraordinary decision and it has to be down to Mr. Callinan.<br\/><br\/>On Tusla, what Mr. Justice Charleton has shown up is that it is an utterly dysfunctional organisation.  While it is one which is extremely important insofar as it has been charged with responsibilities related to child welfare and child protection, that it could be shown to be so utterly dysfunctional and worse raises huge issues about accountability in the organisation and the need for political leadership in addressing the issues that have been identified.  The Charleton report talks about &quot;startling inefficiency and indolence&quot; within the service, a situation where a letter from Tusla was delivered to the wrong address and a mix-up with files.  It would be hard to make it up, given that the mistakes made were so grave.  Extraordinarily, the conclusion come to by many that it had to have been a stitch-up was found to have been a coincidence.  While I am not doubting that finding, the fact that there could have been such a litany of errors that were so damaging to Sergeant McCabe and that they took place within a new and supposedly modern organisation beggars belief.  The depth of the dysfunction in the organisation that such errors could have been made is shocking.<\/p><p>Mr. Justice Charleton refers in his report to procedures being chaotic and says there was inertia in management in the Cavan-Monaghan district.  While the mistake was discovered almost immediately, that was because when Ms D came to know of the rape allegation against Maurice McCabe, she protested that she had never claimed such a thing.  If she had not come forward and done that, who knows what the outcome would have been?  Mr. Justice Charleton said that should have resulted in an immediate and definitive correction within Tusla but it did not.  Not only were serious errors made all along the way in the handling of the two complaints in respect of Maurice McCabe, the response of management was wholly inadequate when the errors came to light.<\/p> <p> Mr. Justice Charleton also said that another essential procedure was not followed in 2006 and 2007, namely, the standard procedure by which a serious allegation of abuse against a person is put to that person.  That never happened.  There were breaches of procedure and protocol all over the place.  Furthermore, the tribunal realised that the file had been filleted, in the term used by Mr Justice Charleton, which points to a huge level of dishonesty within the organisation.  It points also to a huge level of dysfunction and a failure to stand up for the truth.  Where serious errors were found, there was a complete and utter failure on the part of management to deal appropriately with them.  These failures raise the most significant issues for the political system, in particular the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and how she will respond.  This organisation was set up specifically to deal with child protection issues arising from the failings of the HSE, but it turns out that it is entirely dysfunctional.<\/p> <p> The other issue relates to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in respect of which Mr Justice Charleton's findings are damning.  He found a failure to be honest, to stand up for the truth and to come forward when wrongdoing was discovered.  He found a mentality within the organisation which was more concerned with protecting itself and covering up than about the truth and serving the public interest.  That mentality has been identified on umpteen occasions in some of our public bodies.  It is a culture of going along to get along where loyalty to the organisation is more important than the truth or serving the public interest.  The first responsibility of public servants is to serve the public and the public interest.  Tusla and the Garda, however, have been found seriously wanting in that regard.  Mr Justice Charleton said that the Garda offered no criticism of itself at all and that the force required a complete turnaround in its attitude.<\/p> <p> Some members of the force were commended, for example, Chief Superintendent Terry McGinn.  Mr. Justice Charleton said our police force was a resource of brilliant men and women and that while it was a single entry service, it regularly produced people of extraordinary devotion to duty and intelligence at the highest levels.  As such, he said it is the police force that needs to be supported and fostered.  He noted how dispiriting this must be for good and conscientious garda&iacute; who are crying out for leadership within the force and at political level.  Mr. Justice Charleton said that what is needed, therefore, is a serious change in culture.<\/p> <p> In that regard, it is important to bear in mind the comments in the minority report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  In light of what Mr Justice Charleton has found, the Minister must look at that minority report again.  It was produced by Ms Vicky Conway and Dr. Eddie Molloy and has been supported by some very eminent people, including Denis Bradley and Professor Dermot Walsh.  What is required for the Garda more than anything else is independent oversight which is not captured by the Department of Justice and Equality or senior members of the force.  I call on the Minister to change his approach in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700044#WW00500","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539794100,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important issue, albeit only ten minutes.  I could speak for a great deal longer, but that is for another day.  At the outset, I commend Mr Justice Charleton on identifying Sergeant Maurice McCabe as an innocent victim of circumstances over which he had no control.  That is as it should be.  Many others, however, have something to answer for.<\/p>  <p>  I took more than a passing interest in the circumstances which led to this inquiry, given that I was a member for many years of the Committee of Public Accounts, the proceedings of which I followed quite closely.  I also watched the proceedings in the House.  The Government and the Opposition must be responsible at all times and in whatever circumstances they find themselves.  On one occasion as I watched the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts, however, it was clear to me that there was interaction between some of the witnesses and some of the questioners.  That is out of order on two grounds.  First, the then Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, was subjected to a kangaroo court.  She was driven out of office by virtue of the various allegations made against her and to which she had, at the time, no way to respond which would have been believed.  People were saying they did not believe her, which is an extraordinary thing to do when people are in a quasi-judicial situation.  The major casualty was the truth.  Everybody was talking about the issues coming down the track and the leaks which every day were becoming more and more convincing.  There was cross-questioning of the witness before the committee which took on the appearance of McCarthyism.  The witness was questioned again and again to confuse her.  She was asked to remember specific incidents on specific days and conversations with various people.  I hope those who are responsible will apologise to Ms O'Sullivan for the injustice done to her.<\/p>  <p>  In my time in the House, I have never seen any other public official drummed from office in that fashion.  It is a sad reflection on our society and on the House that we allowed it to happen.  I hope sincerely that it does not happen again.  If it does, no one will want to take up public office, including the office of Garda Commissioner.  I remember one day going deliberately to a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This was an issue in respect of which the committee had no function whatsoever.  The Committee of Public Accounts has no function other than to address financial issues arising from the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and making decisions and notes in that respect.  It has no function as far as inquiries are concerned.  The one inquiry it carried out was the DIRT inquiry, and it was legislated for specifically.  It worked, although some of us who participated were not very well rewarded in subsequent elections.  So much for that.  I was appalled at the way the committee conducted the business under discussion tonight and I hope sincerely that corrective action will be taken.<\/p>  <p>  In all things of this nature, two things must prevail, namely, due process and natural justice.  Everyone has the right to his or her good name, to be believed, to state his or her case and to maintain his or her position without being ridiculed and confused.  Everyone has the right to a fair hearing.  In this particular situation, no one was accused directly except by stealth, speculation, innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations.  Eventually, matters came to a head and the Commissioner decided to call it a day.  It was a sad time.  This is a question of natural justice.<\/p><p>In my time on the Committee of Public Accounts we were always warned to ensure that we observed these principles and avoided becoming involved in policy.  Whatever the policy of any particular Department, the committee had and still has no function in that area.  It should not have a function in that area because that would constitute the setting up of a second Government.  That does not and cannot happen.<\/p> <p> We also had leaks virtually two or three times per day, each more incriminating than the one before it.  It now transpires, thanks to the Charleton tribunal, that these leaks were incorrect, misleading, wrong and false.  They were allegations made to do a particular job, namely, to do down a public official.  I would be one of the first people to say we should always question public officials forensically.  We must, however, have respect for them, the role and public service they perform in society and the need for accountability at all times.<\/p> <p> I now turn to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who likewise was drummed from office by a kangaroo court, first of the Committee of Public Accounts and then of this House.  We were all here at the time, and every effort was made to undermine the then T&aacute;naiste in the carrying out of her job and to lay allegations at her feet that did not stand up.  She is now vindicated, but who will apologise to her or to N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan?  No one, because it was not done in the interests of society but in the pursuit of politics.  People said afterwards, \"That is politics.\"  It is not and never was politics.  There was a code of honour in this House once upon a time whereby we all tried to do the best we could and tried to ensure we did not offend our neighbour or our opponent.  We rose to do the best we could for society and for the House, for Parliament, at any given time, and that worked.  Sadly, this has been laid to rest.  I do not propose to go through quotations from the various people in this House and outside it during that period.  Suffice to say we were treated daily to information that was about to be disclosed, secret information that no one knew about, information to the effect that there was going to be a serious problem and that the Minister would have to resign.  It was another kangaroo court and a sad reflection on society, on this House and on our so-called enlightened times.<\/p> <p> It was also a sad reflection on the way we now purport to accept the role women play in our society.  It was an era we would be better off forgetting because at that time women were persistently pursued by the system that applies in this House and around it.  It was without a shadow of a doubt an anti-woman campaign involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the then Commissioner, Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and, in some moments, the Attorney General.  The list goes on.  I remember every moment of this and I have a number of quotations here that I could easily go through if I wanted to.  I want only to remind the people who spoke at that time that they owe the then Minister for Justice and Equality an apology.  She was seriously damaged by innuendo, suspicion and an undermining of her in the same way that McCarthyism succeeded in the United States all those years ago.  I feel ashamed when I think about the way in which these women were treated.  We should offer an apology on behalf of the House to them, at least to give an indication that we, as politicians in this House, do not and will not stand for that kind of thing in any event in respect of any Member of the House, man or woman.<\/p> <p> I hope this is the last episode we see of this kind of political assassination.  I remember at the time doing interviews.  When asked about the matter insofar as the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality was concerned, I said she refused to do what she should not do.  She was vindicated.  I stand over that comment still.  We now wait for those who made all the allegations to come forward and offer their apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700046#YY00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1539794700,"counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700047#ZZ00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539794700,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539794700,"counter":338,"content":"<p>As a matter of clarification, am I allowed to start and get a new slot?

Yesterday evening I and other Members were with people from the healthcare professions.  We were with midwives, doctors, healthcare workers who are united and want to defend their freedom of conscience as to what they will do in the future and how they will deal with people who want to terminate their pregnancies and who will present to them.<\/p>  <p>  We are where we are in society.  The people have spoken.  Some of us did not agree with the result of the referendum, but we live in a democracy and that is that.  There are, however, certain matters on which we now want to hold the Government to account.  One is the freedom of medical practitioners to have a conscientious say.  We do not want people to have to leave their work.  We do not want midwives or doctors to say they must retire because they will be forced to refer people.  I have always held the opinion that people want to opt in rather than opt out.  That makes more sense to me.  Having spoken to people like Deputy Mattie McGrath, I know he is in 100% agreement that people should be asked that question about opting in rather than opting out.<\/p>  <p>  I am very worried about the impression being given that the Government is reluctant to accept amendments to this abortion Bill.  This is possibly due to the Government's reluctance to change the proposals offered to the people in the general scheme published before the referendum.  There are two matters to consider here.  First, the Minister has already changed some of the aspects of those proposals.  Second, the people were voting primarily to repeal the eighth amendment rather than being definitive about the abortion Bill that would be introduced.  I accept there have been broad parameters, but I do not think any amendment which may be proposed would be in contradiction with those parameters.  Rather, they seek to introduce protections for the unborn baby, the mother and the medical personnel.  Amendments in these areas would not remove choice or compassion but they would encourage a positive, life-enhancing choice and involve genuine compassion being offered to all involved.  Many \"Yes\" voters would support these measures without changing the result of the referendum.  They are worthy of consideration and support.<\/p>  <p>  Many \"Yes\" supporters said they did not regard abortion as a good or desirable thing and they would prefer the number of abortions to stay as low as they are now.  The Bill makes no attempt to keep abortion figures low, which ought to be one of its aims.<\/p>  <p>  There should be no backsliding on the proposed 72-hour cooling-off period.  While this is a token restriction, it is a restriction nonetheless, and it may give some women time to consider fully the gravity of the decision they are about to make.  It might give them the chance they need at a critical time.  It might also give them time to obtain full information on the stage of development of their child, what exactly an abortion involves and the positive alternatives to abortion that allow a mother and a baby the best chance at life.<\/p><p>How could any reasonable person deny this vital information to a woman in a crisis pregnancy?  Numerous studies show that abortion can harm women and have an adverse effect on mental health.  Surely a woman has a right to know this in order that she can avoid possible harm to herself and her baby.<\/p> <p> The right to conscientious objection is also desirable and in harmony with the abortion regimes in many countries.  It is a railroading of conscience to force medical personnel - doctors, midwives and pharmacists who provide a great service - to co-operate in something they regard as the finishing of the life of an innocent person.  This co-operation includes referral and is not confined to direct involvement.  It is quite possible for the Minister to introduce a measure that would enable doctors who are willing to get involved in abortion services to declare their willingness to do so on a register set up for such a purpose.  The register could be made available through a website or the proposed helpline.  On 7 October, when the Minister was interviewed on \"This Week\" on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, he spoke about doctors opting in.  According to their own surveys, most GPs are not in favour of becoming involved.  Therefore, it is disrespectful and counter-productive to try to force them to be involved.  If they are forced to do so, we could well end up with highly skilled, motivated and conscientious doctors, nurses and other medical personnel leaving their profession or the country.  If they give up their work here, the shortage of GPs being faced by the health service will be exacerbated.<\/p> <p> Common humanity and decency means that adequate pain relief must be provided for babies who are being aborted.  There may be arguments about when the unborn baby feels pain.  Some say it is quite early in a pregnancy.  It would be compassionate to ensure adequate pain relief was provided for a baby who might feel pain during a procedure like this.  That would be common decency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700047#ZZ01400","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539795300,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700048#AAA00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1539795300,"counter":349,"content":"<p>There must be a requirement that all reasonable care be given to a baby born alive, perhaps after a failed abortion or an early termination under the grounds outlined in the legislation, to give it a chance to survive.  Surely a living baby who has been born is, in legal terms, a citizen of the State who deserves all of the protection and support to which he or she should be entitled.  We have heard too many times about cases in other jurisdictions in which babies have been left to die.  Surely there would be broad support for an amendment that would rule out such inhumane treatment.<\/p>  <p>  The term \"fatal foetal abnormality\" has been used too loosely.  There may be public support for babies with such abnormalities who will die just before or at birth being terminated but not for babies who may live for days, months or even years after birth being terminated.  It is too limiting to suggest, as the legislation does, that if \"extraordinary\" measures have to be used to keep these babies alive, they need not be taken.  Measures that could be classified as \"extraordinary\" are being used on a regular basis in intensive care units in maternity hospitals to give unfortunate babies a chance at life.  Such heroic and lifesaving efforts are being highlighted in RT&Eacute;'s ongoing series \"The Rotunda\".<\/p>  <p>  We should support amendments that would ensure the promotion of positive alternatives to abortion such as adoption and financial support for mothers who wish to keep their babies and fear they might not be able to cope without such support.  Surveys have shown that women often feel forced into having an abortion because they have no choice.  If the legislation was amended appropriately, it could reduce or remove these temporary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  We must also guard against abuses such as abortion on disability or sex-selective grounds.  There are no specific provisions included in the Bill that allow for abortion on such grounds.  Unfortunately, there is no specific ban on such abuses.  In the case of disability, there is a real danger that an abortion will take place on mental health grounds.  In effect, a woman will be allowed to have an abortion because she fears it will be too stressful to have a disabled child.  We learned from media debates during the referendum campaign that this was already happening in approximately half of cases, including in cases in which Down's syndrome was detected in unborn babies.  If we are to make sure we get this right, it is important that we have a thorough debate.  I remind the Minister that before the referendum he promised that we would have such a debate.  We must not make the mistake of rushing legislation without thinking it through first.  Future generations will not thank us for getting this wrong or creating a new scandal in the future, even as we lament current scandals of a similar nature.<\/p>  <p>  What I say I mean and what I mean I say.  I have concerns and worries.  At the same time, I fully respect the way the majority of people voted when the vote took place.  I am not going against it.  All I am saying is that even some of those who voted in favour of repeal have concerns.  They have asked us, as legislators, to deal with this difficult subject.  I am asking us to deal with it in a responsible, intelligent, thoughtful and compassionate way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700048#AAA00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1539795300,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 which I welcome.  As one of those who opposed the introduction of the eighth amendment in 1983, I welcomed the outcome of the referendum held on 25 May.  It was particularly welcome that the proposal to repeal the eighth amendment had been carried by such a significant majority.  I thank all those who worked and voted for the repeal of the amendment, especially the members of the Tipperary Together for Yes campaign who worked throughout County Tipperary.  As a result of their work, over 60% of those who voted in the county voted in favour of repeal.  As someone who opposed the eighth amendment in 1983, I could see that things were very different on this occasion.  In 1983 it was very difficult for those who opposed the eighth amendment to make their views known.  On this occasion, there was significant support for the proposal that the eighth amendment be repealed and many people were prepared to canvass and work for repeal.  People from a broad cross-section of life supported repeal of the eighth amendment.  While I have no intention of rehashing the debate that took place during the referendum campaign and in the past 30 years or more, it is appropriate to recall that the proposal to repeal the eighth amendment was carried by a significant and clear majority on 25 May.  A well informed decision was made after a process involving full and transparent public consultation.  The heads of the legislation were made available as part of that process.  Now that the people have voted heavily in favour of repeal, it is important to pass and implement the Bill before the House as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill follows on from the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2018 which was signed into law by the President on 18 September following the referendum held on 25 May when the people voted to delete Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution and replace it with wording which confirms that the Oireachtas may make laws \"for the regulation of termination of pregnancy\".  The Bill seeks to give effect to the decision of the people to permit the Oireachtas to make such laws.<\/p><p>The main purpose of the Bill is to set out the law governing access to termination of pregnancy.  The explanatory memorandum reads, \"The legislation permits termination to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman, where there is a condition present which is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth, and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.\"  It is important to ensure that the Bill provides for a situation in which there are free, safe, legal and local termination services.<\/p> <p> I do not intend to rehash the debate, which has gone on for years, but I will draw attention to two elements of the Bill, the first being the waiting period.  A mandatory waiting period of three days is stipulated for a termination to proceed within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  According to the World Health Organization, WHO, mandatory waiting periods that are not medically necessary constitute a barrier to safe abortion access and can result in care being delayed.  The imposition of mandatory waiting periods also undermines a woman as a competent decision maker in her own right.  Since such unwarranted waiting periods can cause delay in accessing services, it is clear that they are inordinately onerous and can result in unnecessary restrictions.  It is also unclear from the Bill whether the three-day waiting period is included within the 12-week limit.  For these reasons, the mandatory period should be removed from the Bill.<\/p> <p> The second element is conscientious objection.  Doctors, nurses, support staff and health professionals must of course be entitled to object on a conscientious basis.  For the conscientious objection clause to be workable and not hinder a patient's right to termination services, though, there must be an obligation to make an appropriate referral so as to ensure refusal of care does not create an obstacle to accessing services.  It must be clear that conscientious objection can refer only to an individual and not to an institution.  In rural areas where access to services and options is limited due to, for example, geographical restrictions, services must be made available locally.  The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has specifically recommended that states should ensure that an \"adequate number of health-care providers willing and able to provide such services should be available at all times in both public and private facilities and within reasonable geographical reach.\"  Clarification is needed as to the oversight process for medical practitioners opting to use conscientious objection and the question of how a guarantee of access to abortion care will be provided not just in theory, but in fact, right across the country.<\/p> <p> These two elements must be considered.  The waiting period should be removed while ensuring that, while the conscientious objections of individuals are honoured fully, referrals are made available and services are provided locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700048#AAA00400","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539795900,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  Like most of the Deputies who have contributed in recent days, many of us did not believe we would get the opportunity at all.  This is clearly important legislation and it will have a profound impact for many Irish citizens, particularly the women of Ireland.  The Bill is important not just in terms of respecting the democratic decision of our citizens, but in ensuring that women have bodily autonomy, are treated as equals in their own country and are no longer forced to travel to access the healthcare they require or take medication in their homes in unregulated and potentially unsafe environments.<\/p>  <p>  As a people, we have made a decision to no longer bury our heads in the sand and pretend that abortion for Irish women is not a reality.  It is a reality, and crisis pregnancies happen everyday.  Since the referendum, many have undoubtedly occurred.  For too long, the State has lacked compassion and failed to recognise the difficult circumstances in which women can find themselves when faced with a crisis pregnancy.  Our citizens have taken the lead on this issue and have clearly and decisively said, \"No more\".  With a vote of 66.4% to remove the eighth amendment from our Constitution, the people have said that they can no longer tolerate a system whereby the needs of our sisters, daughters, friends and relatives are not put first.  Indeed, my own constituency of Dublin Fingal voted 77% in favour of removing it.  Having supported the \"Yes\" vote in the referendum, I am committed to supporting this legislation as it passes through the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  To paraphrase the words of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, following the referendum result, instead of echoing the sentiment of the eighth amendment whereby women in crisis pregnancies were told to take the boat or take the plane, the people of Ireland clearly said, \"Take our hand\".  For 35 years, the eighth amendment was in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  At the time of the referendum, no citizen under the age of 53 had ever had the opportunity to have a say on whether it had a place in our society.  On 25 May, voters both young and old overwhelmingly stated that it did not represent the society in which they wanted to live.  I am glad we now live in a country where such a restrictive and oppressive article no longer has a place in our Constitution.  For many years, a large number of Deputies had stated that the Constitution was no place for such an amendment in the first place and that it should primarily have been a matter for the Houses to determine the fine detail.  After all, the Constitution is a guidance document and should not get into detailed specifics.  While that is my view, I believe it has support across the country.<\/p>  <p>  We have recognised that Irish women are having abortions, and will continue to do so.  As a society, however, we can no longer force them to travel to another jurisdiction in order to access healthcare that we should be providing them here at home.<\/p>  <p>  In this House, we have spoken about how the referendum result and this legislation will impact upon women.  However, I wish to voice my strong support for changing the term \"woman\" in the legislation to \"pregnant person\".  In an Ireland of so much positive social change in recent years, we must foster inclusion and ensure that no person is left behind.  Using the term \"woman\" in the legislation might have negative impacts and effects for the transgender community.  This is something we can and must avoid.  Society, including this House, must recognise that Ireland has changed dramatically in a social, legislative and political sense over many years.  I do not proclaim to understand all of the societal changes.  I am 40, but I sometimes feel old when I try to get to grips with these issues.  It is not my place to instil my views on anyone else, though.<\/p>  <p>  The opportunity to contribute to the Bill at this stage of its development is important to me and many others.  As such, it is important that every Member and not just the Cabinet, my party, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in or any of the other parties that are wholeheartedly supportive of this matter be given the right to have a say on it regardless of whether that Member opposes the removal of the eighth amendment.<\/p><p>Many discussions have taken place on decisions of conscience among both members of the medical profession and Members of the Oireachtas.  I believe it is their right to state their own position on this matter.  However, I respect some of the Members who were quick to come out and say they respected the overwhelming result of the referendum in May and will support or acquiesce to this Bill passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe that is the right thing to do, particularly in some constituencies where the decision was not only a landslide in favour of a \"Yes\" vote but where there was an extraordinary outpouring of support for the removal of the eight amendment from the Constitution.<\/p> <p> The Government published the heads of the Bill prior to the referendum which showed its intention for the legislation should the referendum have been passed.  That outlined the Government's intention to legislate for access to terminations up to 12 weeks, with no restrictions, and only after this in cases, for instance, where there is a significant risk to life or health of the mother, or what many term a fatal foetal abnormality which will lead to the death of the foetus.  I believe, as legislators, that given the strength of the \"Yes\" vote in the referendum, we have a duty to enact legislation to give effect to the measures outlined in the heads of the Bill.  This legislation does just that.<\/p> <p> I will address the issue of conscientious objection.  While I agree that medical practitioners should be entitled to conscientiously object to participating in a termination, I firmly believe they should be obliged to refer a patient seeking a termination to a doctor who does not conscientiously object.  In modern society, while respecting the beliefs of each individual, there must be a line whereby we do not impose our own beliefs on others.  As such, I believe the requirement for a referral to be of paramount importance.<\/p> <p> I have read stories recently about how, in areas in Italy, women may have to visit numerous hospitals before finding a doctor willing to perform a termination or they may turn to unregulated treatment.  That cannot be allowed to occur in this jurisdiction.  We have a duty to ensure that women in Ireland receive the healthcare they deserve, which is what the people of Ireland requested that this Oireachtas deliver.  Including the requirement for doctors who conscientiously object to refer to a doctor who does not object is vital in achieving this.<\/p> <p> The referendum decision to repeal the eight amendment of the Constitution and to allow for the termination of pregnancy to be regulated by the Oireachtas signifies a maturing of our society and a move to a more compassionate, equal and caring society, one which is no longer afraid to address the realities which face its citizens.<\/p> <p> As we debate this legislation, I acknowledge the work of those who campaigned tirelessly for days, weeks, months, years and even decades in the lead-up to the referendum, the women who so bravely told their own personal stories, the Together for Yes organisation and especially the younger members of our society who worked so hard to deliver the historic \"Yes\" vote to remove the eight amendment.  I sincerely hope each of those young people fully realise the impact they had in this campaign and how their actions worked to make a historic change to our Constitution.  I also hope they remain politically engaged.<\/p> <p> In debating this Bill in this House, let us not rehash the referendum debate but work together constructively to deliver legislation which is reflective of the will of the people, as showcased by the 66.4% vote in favour of repealing the eight amendment.  Let us work together to deliver a society which is more compassionate and caring towards those facing a crisis pregnancy, and let us ensure they no longer have to travel to access healthcare which we now have the power to deliver for them in their own country.<\/p> <p> I look forward to supporting this Bill and, in the new year, to the women of Ireland being able to receive the healthcare they require with dignity and no longer being faced with the prospect of having to travel to the United Kingdom or further afield or, worse, consuming unregulated medication at home.  I fully intend to support the Government on this Bill.  I understand I may be sharing the remainder of the time in this slot with Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700049#BBB00200","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539796500,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Durkan want to take the remaining time in this slot or does he want a full slot?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700050#CCC00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1539796500,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I am easy about that.

I personally have a strong pro-life view and would not like to see unrestricted access to abortion in Ireland.  As a realist, I realise I cannot force my view on every citizen or on the two thirds of the people of Ireland who expressed a view contrary to mine in the referendum.  It now falls on us, as legislators, to set out the law governing access to the termination of pregnancy in this country.  As I have said previously, we should engage in meaningful respectful debate on the issue, rather than rushing the legislation through.  We all know that hard cases can make bad law.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to speak for the people of the Louth constituency on this issue, the 66.5% who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but also the 33.5% who voted \"No\".  There are particular areas of concern for me and many of those concerns have been voiced both by those who voted \"Yes\" and those who voted \"No\".  The Bill proposes to provide for the early termination of pregnancy which may be carried out by a medical practitioner who, having examined the pregnant woman, is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the pregnancy concerned has not exceeded 12 weeks of pregnancy.  The Bill further provides that the termination of pregnancy may not be carried out unless at least three days have elapsed from the date of certification.  I, like others, have a concern regarding the timescales involved in cases which fall outside of the \"early termination\" definition, cases outlined where a fatal foetal abnormality may be discovered later on in the pregnancy.   I and others need clarification on those timescales as the Bill does not specify how late on in such a pregnancy a termination can take place.  I, like others, would have a huge problem with any form of late termination of pregnancy.  I know this is a very complex area but it deserves teasing out and discussion.<\/p>  <p>  I support the rights of medical professionals and employees who should not be forced in any sense to be involved in abortion.  This Bill does not affect any current legal provisions relating to consent to medical treatment.  The intention is that the provisions of the Bill will operate within the existing legal provisions on consent for medical treatment.   Medical practitioners, nurses and midwives, many of whom have been in contact with our offices, should not be obliged to carry out or assist in carrying out terminations of pregnancy if they have a conscientious objection to doing so.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed that abortion services will be offered to women from January next through a GP-led service.  I presume a panel with the names of GPs available to deal with the service will be advertised so as not to place any doctor who has a conscientious objection in a compromised position.  Consideration should be given also to enshrining the rights of those medical professionals who have a conscientious objection within the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Before the referendum, I expressed my hope in this House that any debate in advance of such a referendum would be conducted in a manner respectful of the different points of view.  That is the spirit of any democracy, and everybody is entitled to his or her views.  I was saddened to see the acrimony that ensued on both sides but I hope as discussion continues on this legislation that all views will be heard, respected and listened to and freedom of speech, thoughts and opinion will not be in any way derided, mocked, belittled or ridiculed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700050#CCC00700","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1539797100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.  As we are all well aware, on 25 May this year the people of Ireland voted overwhelmingly, clearly and emphatically to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution which acknowledged the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.  As a result of this decision, the onus is now on the Oireachtas to legislate for abortion in this country.<\/p>  <p>  As many in this House are aware, I strongly supported the retention of the eighth amendment and the right to life of every unborn child and I still do so.  However, I stated clearly after the result of the referendum that I will not obstruct or oppose the passage of this legislation through the D&aacute;il.  I will engage constructively on all Stages.  I was surprised that pre-legislative scrutiny was not an option for this Bill.  As Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I know that this is a legislative process that is used frequently.  What was the thinking behind the decision not to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill?  <\/p>  <p>  During the many discussions prior to the referendum, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach promised safe, legal and rare abortions and I will be holding them to account on this.  Some of the concerns that I hope to have addressed on Committee Stage are also concerns that I had during the referendum campaign.  In particular, I refer to section 10 on the risk to life or health, which provides that a termination of pregnancy may be carried out where two medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, are of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the foetus has not reached viability.  I want to tease out the definition of viability, accepted in Irish maternity hospitals as 23 to 24 weeks.  This is deliberately vague and seems to allow for abortions late into the second and third trimester.  Viability is the point at which a child can survive outside of the womb with or without medical assistance.  This is not a fixed point in time and with continuing medical advances, children are surviving from an earlier and earlier age.  If an unborn child is past the point at which medical technology can support that child outside the womb, there should be an absolute legal prohibition on an abortion at that point.  The Bill contains no express cut-off point of viability in the case of abortions under the so-called emergency ground, where a doctor certifies that an abortion is immediately necessary to avert an immediate risk to the woman's life or of serious harm to her mental or physical health.  <\/p>  <p>  My next concern relates to unborn babies with disabilities.  During the campaign the Minister for Health stated that disability, including Down's syndrome, would be excluded as grounds for an abortion in any legislation but there is absolutely nothing in this Bill ruling out abortion on such grounds.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eight Amendment of the Constitution looked at the issue of disability and specifically excluded it as grounds for a termination.  The committee differed from the Citizens' Assembly, as noted by the Minister for Health in the Seanad on 17 January 2018.  Why are there no specifics relating to disabilities in the Bill?  I have read the legislation several times and have not found the word disability anywhere.  <\/p>  <p>  Like other colleagues, I have been contacted by medical and health professionals from all over the country who have grave concerns about freedom of conscience provisions in the Bill.  The right to freedom of conscience is a fundamental right protected by the Irish Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  One doctor told me that he trained for 11 years and entered his profession to protect life, not take it.  The Bill proposes to force doctors to refer women for abortions against their conscience.  This is deeply unjust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700051#DDD00100","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1539797100,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700051#DDD00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1539797100,"counter":361,"content":"<p>There are many medical and health professionals who will carry out abortion procedures and they were to the fore during the referendum campaign.  However, there are many more who simply cannot agree &ldquo;to make such arrangements for the transfer of care of the pregnant woman concerned as may be necessary to enable the woman to avail of the termination of pregnancy concerned\".  In New Zealand, for example, even though health professionals have a responsibility to inform a patient that she can avail of abortion services elsewhere, there is no direct responsibility on them to transfer the care of the two patients in order to end the life of one.  This is the crux of the issue.  I met a 33 year old nurse yesterday who told me that when she was in her first year of training, at 18, she found herself to be pregnant.  Her son is now 15.  She told me that she will leave nursing as a result of the referendum.  She may work with older people or work in a nursing home but she is too conflicted to stay in general nursing.  There is no way that she would be able to work in a situation where the life of an unborn child might be ended.  We must respect and listen to the many medical people who are very conflicted on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  During the debate prior to the referendum there was much discussion of how we can reduce crisis pregnancies.  We need to have that discussion again.  How can we support women faced with the most difficult choices?  How can we help homeless women who are pregnant?  A couple of weeks ago we heard about a woman who was homeless and living in emergency accommodation who had stillborn twins.  The stress of her situation cannot have been easy.  We need perinatal hospices for those who are faced with the most challenging circumstances so that whatever decision they make, the necessary supports are there for them.  If they decide to bring their baby into the world for however long, they must get wrap-around supports.  I accept that we could not continue to export our problems.  I also accept that many couples found themselves in the most horrific circumstances, expecting a baby with a fatal foetal abnormality, a life-limiting condition and the only option open to them was to go abroad to England.  I know and accept that this was not right.  At the same time, those who want to bring their baby to life, whether that baby lives for six hours, six days or six months, must be supported.<\/p>  <p>  Sex education in schools is extremely important.  The importance of providing vital information to our young people on dealing with crisis pregnancies and all of the options available cannot be overstated.  Free contraception is also extremely important, especially for young women who might not always be able to afford it.  The provision of same will certainly limit unplanned pregnancies.  <\/p>  <p>  It is vital that there is no reduction in the mandatory 72-hour waiting period.  This was a core part of the proposals on which the Government fought the referendum campaign, with the Taoiseach and others promising that the existence of a waiting period would be a safeguard against abortion being seen as the only option.  If women request counselling, this service should be available to them.  It is vital that women with an unplanned pregnancy that they may not want to go ahead with are given the option of talking to someone and going through all of the options available to them.  Whether women decide to go ahead with an abortion or not to go ahead, counselling should be available to them to enable them to make the decision that is best for them.  In last week's budget &euro;l2 million was allocated for abortion services.  Why can we not see similar ring-fenced funding put in place to support women in crisis or unplanned pregnancies who might want to have their baby but who might not be in a financial position to so do?  These women might be homeless, in an abusive relationship, or have mental health difficulties.<\/p><p>All legislation needs to be debated respectfully and diligently and this legislation is no different.  I will engage on all Stages to try to strengthen this legislation so that abortion will be, as promised, safe, legal and rare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700051#DDD00300","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539797700,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The abortion referendum was divisive, and probably the most difficult discussion we have had as a nation since the previous referendum in 1983.  In many ways it was more difficult in recent times because there was more consultation and people did not hide behind religion during this discussion.  The fact that we did manage to have a mature conversation was very significant and it was gratifying to see the majority of the debates carried out in a dignified and respectful manner both in this Chamber and in the public arena.  A host of different viewpoints were expressed but to see the positive engagement that took place shows our compassion and maturity as a nation, notwithstanding a small number of extreme views on both sides of the debate.<\/p>  <p>  From my own conversations with constituents, colleagues, friends and family members, it became clear that many \"Yes\" voters were reluctant \"Yes\" voters and many \"No\" voters similarly voted \"No\" reluctantly.  There were not many totally certain opinions at the outset but the seismic victory for the \"Yes\" campaign must be respected as reflecting the will of the Irish people.  There were more votes counted to remove the eighth amendment than there were to insert it in 1983.  This was a definitive mandate for access to abortion care in specific circumstances at home in Ireland.  We cannot be triumphalist - and I say this as one who voted \"Yes\" - as this legislation progresses because we have to think of the gravity of the decision facing women in crisis pregnancies or with the devastating diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality.  Let us remember that this legislation was necessary to permit terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman or where there is a condition present which is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth.  In the case of a risk to the life or health of the woman who is pregnant, women can and must be trusted to make the best decision in the most distressing of situations together with their professional medical consultants. <\/p>  <p>  The scaremongering about late term abortions is unfounded.  The majority of women who opt not to continue a pregnancy do so in the early stages.  In England and Wales, 92% of terminations are carried out at less than 12 weeks' gestation.  Our own statistics are unclear as the Irish abortion rate remains unknown.  We do know that at least 3,265 Irish women had abortions in UK clinics in 2016.  Research indicates that the two biggest providers of online medication receive approximately 3,000 requests for help from Irish women each year.  Some of these are the ones we will now be able to take care of in their own country.  I understand that a communications campaign being prepared by the Department of Health and the HSE will encourage women to attend crisis pregnancy services as early as possible in their pregnancy.<\/p>  <p>  I met with doctors and health professionals yesterday and, while I understand and empathise with the case for an opt-out clause, it cannot be at the expense of women's health.  I respect the right to conscientious objection and the role it plays in the professional code of health workers but women's health must be paramount in all decisions that are made.  This legislation represents the will of the people as 66.4% of the population voted for it.  Review panels and committees provided for by this Bill give further safeguards and oversight of the process and, importantly, the Bill also makes it an offence for a person, by any means whatsoever to intentionally end the life of a foetus, otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  Stiff penalties would apply for this and rightly so. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, it is important also that we introduce legislation to introduce safe access zones to prevent women being intimidated or harassed when seeking these services.  It is important to remember that ten women a day are still travelling abroad to secure terminations while we continue to talk about legislation.  These women experience financial, physical and emotional burdens.  We must welcome the end of the unsafe and unregulated practice of procuring pills online to end pregnancies and our citizens travelling overseas to secure healthcare.  None of these women has had appropriate follow-up care due to stigma and fear of prosecution.  This legislation finally puts an end to the risks associated with illegal abortion and regulates for something that already exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700052#EEE00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1539797700,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille stairi&uacute;il seo.

It has been a long time coming to the floor of the D&aacute;il and one that the majority of the Irish people wholeheartedly endorsed in May of this year.  With that a burden and blemish on the face of the State and of the Constitution has been wiped away.  The eighth amendment should never have been in the Constitution.  Abortion should never have been dealt with in the Constitution.  This is the right way to deal with it.  It was an entirely inappropriate way of legislating on the matter.  As the Attorney General of the time predicted, it has caused great uncertainty and the text of the eighth amendment was almost a contradiction in terms.  That is the uncertainty it created.  It caused significant harm to women around Ireland.  The former master of Holles Street, Dr. Peter Boylan, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that it has caused grave harm, including death.  <\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies said at the time of the referendum that this need not be a bitter and divisive debate and I hope it will not be.  This debate has seen the best and the worst of Irish politics.  Some people took this campaign as an opportunity to say intemperate and intolerable things but also many on both sides of the debate exercised great restraint, understanding and compassion, in being able to put themselves in the position of other people and of people who took different views on this proposal.  It is quite remarkable that we are here.<\/p><p>We are now in a position to legislate, without having the fetter of a constitutional provision, in a measured, reasonable, compassionate way.  That would have seemed impossible even a short few years ago - as recently as during the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il - with the legislation that was passed following the X case, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which seemed a significant and contentious step forward.  It already seems far out of date, archaic, inadequately compassionate and an excessive restriction on the rights of women and pregnant people.  A remarkable amount has changed in that regard.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; suntasach s&uacute;il siar a chaitheamh ar an gcomhth&eacute;acs &aacute;irithe inar th&aacute;inig an reachta&iacute;ocht isteach breis is 30 bliain &oacute; shin.

It was conceived in the context of a number of elements.  To a large extent, however, it was a cynical attempt to gain political advantage at a time of tight D&aacute;il arithmetic.  Credit is particularly due to those who stood in a minority position in very difficult circumstances and when their opinions would have been marginalised.  It is important in that context that the minority now is respected and if they hold a contrary view, it is important that they are allowed to express it in a reasonable and respectful way, though I do not share it.  Those who were in the minority position at that time were marginalised and suffered intimidation.  Some of those people remained steadfast nonetheless and were joined in the recent referendum by those who have only recently got the vote and others who do not yet have the vote.  The people who fought against the eighth amendment many years ago have been fighting ever since.  While it might have seemed impossible at one stage, it was through their perseverance that we are in this position whereby the constitutional block on the ability of the Oireachtas to legislate in respect of this matter has been removed.  Many Members of the Oireachtas deserve credit for the referendum being brought forward and passed.  That includes the Opposition, the Government, the various political parties and Independents.<\/p> <p> The primary credit for the fact that we had a referendum and that it was passed goes to what became a mass movement.  It was a mass movement that started with a small number of committed activists but which developed and took in what ultimately became quite a wide and representative cross-section of Irish society.  On reading media reports anticipating the referendum from even a year ago, one would have expected that it would involve a relatively narrow coalition or would not have been fully representative in the way that it was.  The margins by which the referendum was passed in areas throughout the country surprised many.  It reflected the fact that this was backed by a very broad range of society.  Yet again, Irish society has been shown to be well ahead of both this institution and politics.<\/p> <p> It was not always my view that legislation of this kind would need to be passed.  That is probably true of many people.  I was working in Leinster House at the time of the death of Savita Halappanavar.  That event had a profound impact on many people.  It certainly had a significant impact on me.  While it did not, in itself, change my mind overnight, it forced me to examine the basis of my position or beliefs at that time, and to read up and examine more.  I did so over several years.  At this point, the two pillars of my position on this are, first, that the priority in all instances needs to be the life and health of the woman and, second, that it is a wrong and violent act to coerce women into carrying to term against their wishes.  It is on that basis that I was very much in favour of this legislation and of the referendum.  I hope that this legislation can progress relatively well and without inordinate haste.  Much of the detail will be dealt with by the select committee.  I recognise that it is important to take stock of the vote that took place.<\/p> <p> N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go raibh &eacute;inne ag s&uacute;il leis an tromlach a bh&iacute; i bhf&aacute;bhar aisghair a dh&eacute;anamh ar an ocht&uacute; leas&uacute;.

They are taking some stock of amendments and of the detail involved.  That is fair enough and legitimate.  It is legitimate to vote against this legislation even after the referendum, which is not to say that it is right.  The referendum was on the ability of the Oireachtas to legislate and that is what the people have entrusted us to do.  That is what we must do.  That can take many different forms.  In the coming years, there may be attempts to review this legislation.  There may be amending legislation and that could take many forms.  In that context, I think it is legitimate for people to oppose this legislation.  That siad, it is right to support this legislation because, while the vote had a formal legal effect with a specific question that was asked, it is fairly clear, in the context of the proposals published by the Oireachtas joint committee and the Government, the shape people felt legislation would take.  It is important that we give effect to that.  I am sure it is quite difficult for people who voted against the referendum who will now not oppose this legislation.  It is a brave thing to do.

The Bill now starts by outlining the offences rather than taking a more health-related approach.  The offences have been moved from section 19 to section 5.  That is not generally the case with other legislation, apart from perhaps criminal law, which is not a particularly good indicator.<\/p> <p> There has been a fair bit of discussion about the waiting time of three days.  We need to be guided by medical experts.  To be fair to the Oireachtas committee, it did great work.  I have two committee members next to me and I see others in the Chamber as well.  The committee weighed all the evidence that was heard from all perspectives, but members were guided to a great extent by the views of medical professionals and we must also be so guided.  I refer to Dr. Peter Boylan, the representatives of the Medical Council and the Irish College of General Practitioners who commented on that as well.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be guided by such experts.  To some extent it is perhaps a political decision and it could be based on optics to some extent but to a degree I understand the logic behind it in that I do not think anyone takes any significant decision lightly.  If one is going to take a significant decision of this nature, if one can one should reflect on it as best as one can in the circumstances.  We are already operating in a time-limited framework in the sense that abortion services are only to be provided up to 12 weeks.  I think that to put in another qualifier creates difficulties, not least for people who are in a crisis.  While it may be the case that in an ideal world individuals might take time to make such a decision, I do not think it is something that we should be legally forcing on people because it is most likely to have grave, unintended consequences for certain individuals.<\/p> <p> I am also conscious of the conscience issue.  I respect the fact that many members of the public and general practitioners will have moral difficulty with the legislation.  Section 23(3) is appropriate and will protect conscientious objectors and that is reasonable.  Apart from accident and emergency services, the public access the health system through GPs.  That is the starting point for them to flow through the system.  We cannot expect people who may not know the philosophical or moral position of their local GP to end up in a cul-de-sac.  They should expect that any GP they go to will at least be able to direct them through the system.  That is a reasonable expectation and it is not an unreasonable ask.  A balance is being struck in terms of conscientious objection that is fair and reasonable.<\/p> <p> I support the proposal that has been made that the wording should reflect pregnant people, as opposed to simply women.  That is reasonable and important as it allows for inclusivity and respect for all pregnant people.<\/p> <p> The Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution gave a lot of time to ancillary services.  That is vitally important.  We need serious investment in counselling and support.  Sex education was examined and it is clear that it is outdated, unregulated and of a different era.  That issue clearly needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> It was a requirement in this jurisdiction that there would be a referendum but there is no such requirement in the North.  I hope it will be possible at some stage in the not-too-distant future that we will be in a position to have similar legislation there to allow for a similar regime in the North.  The North has to be next.  It is one of the key issues that needs to be addressed, among many outstanding political issues in the North.  It is clear that the public appetite in the North is not radically different to what it is here.  All parties in the North need to reflect on that, but so too do the British Government and the Government as this is a human rights issue and it must be addressed.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don reachta&iacute;ocht seo.

Along with other Members I happen to be one of the people who sat in committee for the final quarter of last year discussing this particular issue.  There was a general recognition that there was an evolution of thinking in the course of the examination of the witnesses and their submissions to the committee hearings.  I have the height of respect for everyone.  Like most of the committee members I would not be in any way a strong supporter of abortion, as such.  The definition of abortion is the deliberate intervention, the object of which is to terminate the life of the baby that is yet to be born.  There are other interventions that may not do that at all.  That is why some of us went to great pains to ensure that the three-day waiting period was observed.  I strongly support that on the basis that two of the delegations that presented in the course of the committee hearings pointed out the fact that in the first instance when a girl or a woman found herself pregnant, possibly with a crisis pregnancy, she needed support, counselling and help and to be able to rely on some person in whom she could confide to give her advice.  They also explained to us that in some cases the person changed her mind and that her first decision, whether it was for or against might not necessarily be the course of action she decided to follow.  I believe that is correct and that we need to recognise the situation such a woman might find herself in and to provide for such cases.<\/p>  <p>  We also learnt something equally important, namely, the necessity for proper sex education in schools and the need to ensure that it is comprehensively imparted to the new generation so that young people, both men and women, are conscious of the consequences of certain activities but more important, that they are in a position to be able to know in certain circumstances what is in their interests, and in particular in the interests of their health and what to do and what not to do.<\/p>  <p>  Late stage abortions have been mentioned in recent days as something that was not previously discussed.  In fact, it was, and socio-economic reasons were put forward as a reason for having an abortion.  The committee rejected that at the time.<\/p><p>I believe it did so on good grounds and I believe it was the right thing to do.  I stand over that and the Bill reflects that as well.<\/p> <p> Much has been said about Down's syndrome and the need to ensure that those with Down's syndrome are not victimised in the course of the enactment of the legislation.  In fact, the committee went to great lengths to ensure that the existence of Down's syndrome was not going to be a precondition for having an abortion, and rightly so.<\/p> <p> We made several other changes in the course of the hearings.  For one thing, we had to recognise the facts.  The fact is that young women and not-so-young women in some circumstances have found themselves in a panic situation with nowhere to go and no advice to draw on.  It may be only be a matter for themselves and the situation may be fast evolving.  They may not have much time to act.  What is the right thing to do?  The legislation now before the House best reflects the thinking during the course of the submissions we heard in the committee.  That is as it should be.  I do not believe we should deviate from it at all.  We should incorporate within the legislation the sentiments expressed before the committee and we are doing that.  These sentiments were subsequently reflected in the heads published before the referendum.  My reason for saying this is because we voted on it.  The people voted on the heads that were presented before the referendum and I believe we have an obligation to ensure that is the way it stands.<\/p> <p> I recognise that people have a right to conscientious objection.  That needs to be provided for, but it should not be as a result of any diminution in the rights of women to get the services that are required at any particular time.  We spent considerable time in the committee discussing that particular issue.  I have dealt with situations - I imagine everyone else in the House has too - and read about situations of a nature that raised serious questions about the extent to which women's rights and entitlements to health and life were not necessarily observed.  There are certain conditions that a woman can have ordinarily.  During the course of a pregnancy these conditions may accelerate rapidly to the extent that, at a certain point, her health and, rapidly thereafter, her life will be in danger.  We have had several illustrations of this in recent years.  That is unacceptable and we must legislate for it.  There have been situations in which the threat to the health and life of women, who may well have had existing families, might have been ignored and that is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> We accept the right to conscientious objection among the medical profession, whether it be pharmacists, doctors, nurses or whatever the case may be, but there must be referral to someone who will deal with the situation insofar as the woman is concerned.  She should not be deprived of obtaining the services she requires.  There may be a medical requirement at that stage.  I am strongly of the opinion that we need to be absolutely certain that her life is not put in jeopardy as a result of that kind of situation.  There are plenty of ways and means of dealing with the situation if it should come to pass that the legislation was flawed, if provisions did not work or if someone at some stage later on were to say that if the rule of law applied the woman would have been treated differently.<\/p> <p> It is generally recognised and has been said over and over again that this is the safest country in the world for a woman to give birth.  There are numerous reasons for accepting or believing that.  However, I wish to point out that increasing numbers of court cases arise from situations where women are aggrieved after treatment and sometimes pass away after treatment.  In such cases they, or their families, have been concerned about the way they have been treated.  We could all say this is because of the litigious society we live in.  That may well be but it is not true to say that there is no risk involved.  I accept, and everyone else realises, that women have been having babies for millions of years, generally without any problem.  However, significant numbers of situations can arise from time to time in which the woman has no control over what is happening.  In such situations her health can rapidly deteriorate to such an extent that she has no chance of living.  That has arisen in a number of situations in recent years and that is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> I mentioned the question of the need for proper sex education in schools and elsewhere in primary and secondary level.  However, I did not go into the details of birth control in the first instance.  I do not believe that abortion should be a form of birth control but I believe that the way some women were treated raises questions.  I do not propose to go into these cases in detail tonight but the way some women were treated during the past 150 years, and especially during our lifetime, was simply appalling.  This applied especially to pregnant women who were banished from society and cast out into exterior darkness.  The nuns were subsequently blamed for what happened in the Tuam Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home and various other mother and baby homes throughout the country.  The nuns were blamed but in actual fact it was society that did not live up to its expectations.  Society opted out and did not want to know about it.  We now review the situation in the light of hindsight and we say that it should not have happened.  That is right: it should not have happened.  It was disgraceful carry-on, just as it would be in any country.  This did not only happen in this country; it arose in several other jurisdictions as well.  It was an old-fashioned way of responding to a crisis pregnancy.  I hope that we have sufficiently developed and evolved to ensure that we do not have repetition of that.  I hope that when this legislation is passed it will cater for the kind of situations that we have seen previously in which women did not receive the kind of treatment they should have received.<\/p> <p> I want to finish by simply saying one thing.  This legislation has come after an extraordinary response from the public who voted.  They voted clearly in the knowledge that they wanted some things to change.  That is as it should be.  Society will eventually recognise that what is being done now is the right thing, that it is fair and that it does not go overboard to the extent applicable to our next-door neighbours, where there is abortion on demand.  This is not abortion on demand.  There are restrictions such that it does not happen.  Advice is available to women in the first instance and hence the three-day waiting period.  That will be of considerable benefit to the general extent of our health services.  It will be of considerable reassurance to the women of the country.  It will create a clear impression in the minds of women, young or old, who may be pregnant in a particular situation.  They will know that they can rely on the support services available, go forward into the maternity hospital or go for counselling.  They will know that they will be protected, that their interests will be borne in mind and that they will be protected throughout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700054#GGG00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539799500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Durkan.

I will be brief.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The referendum was passed in May of this year by 66% of the electorate.  However, in excess of 700,000 people voted against repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p><p>Many of those have concerns about the proposed legislation and I wish to highlight some of those concerns.  In particular, I note that a recent poll showed that 60% of the population do not want taxpayer funded abortion, which will cost &euro;20 million per year.  Many people voted against this legislation and I am very concerned that their money will be used to carry out abortions in Ireland.  That needs to be seriously examined.<\/p> <p> Repeal the eighth do not want this part of the legislation enacted.  I also have a problem with that.  People who are receiving treatment for most conditions in this country must pay for that treatment and care.  I refer to cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy and other people suffering from serious health conditions.  Is it not unreasonable for a person seeking care and treatment from a healthcare professional in a private capacity to pay for their treatment?  I ask that this be removed from the legislation.  In a time when the healthcare service here is heaving with a record number of people on trolleys on a regular basis, a lack of home care for the elderly and huge hospital waiting lists, allocating &euro;20 million for this service does not seem fair or just.<\/p> <p> On the issue of conscientious objection, does the Minister or his officials have any idea of the number of doctors and healthcare professionals who have a conscientious objection to abortion and also have serious concerns about referring the patient to another doctor for treatment?  This is a very serious issue with significant moral implications.  I understand the provisions of the Bill are in line with the medical ethics guidelines but, in reality, the issue of abortion for many in the medical profession is a far more serious issue than any other medical treatment they may be asked to administrate during their careers.<\/p> <p> Also, general practitioner surgeries are already over-stretched and under-resourced.  This will add another layer of work and administration to their practice.  Has the Government engaged in any research or collaboration with general practitioners on the roll-out of abortion services through their practices?<\/p> <p> That leads me to my concerns that the Bill makes no reference to pre-abortion or post-abortion counselling.  This is a vital element and one the people were assured would be provided.  I have concerns that the only reference to counselling in the Bill is in section 24 regarding the prohibition on receiving special benefits or advantages.  Surely counselling should be adequately addressed and funded as part of the abortion services.<\/p> <p> I want to specifically discuss section 11 of the Bill, which allows for abortion where there is a risk to life or health in an emergency.  With its current wording, this allows for abortion beyond the point of viability, right up to the point of birth.  If a baby can survive outside the womb, surely it can be delivered rather than aborted.  If a late term abortion is proposed on mental health grounds, I believe an abortion could cause a further deterioration in mental health rather than an improvement.<\/p> <p> That brings me back to my earlier point regarding the importance of counselling and the requirement to have this adequately addressed in the Bill.  Late term abortions under section 11 will have far-reaching consequences for mother and child.  The Bill needs to set a point of viability where the baby should be delivered and not aborted.<\/p> <p> The people of Ireland have voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  However, the Bill needs to be refined and many issues of concern, even for those who voted for repeal, need to be addressed.  I hope my concerns will be addressed and appropriate amendments introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700055#HHH00400","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539800100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eamon Scanlon who is sharing time with Deputy Eugene Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1539800100,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The people voted on 25 May to repeal the eighth amendment.  The majority voted in favour of introducing abortion into Ireland.  The D&aacute;il and the Seanad must now deal with that decision but many of the people who voted \"Yes\" and many who voted \"No\" have concerns about aspects of the Bill, and their voices have a right to be heard in this debate.<\/p>  <p>  The right to freedom of conscience is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  No person should be required by force of law to take innocent life.  Irish doctors, nurses and midwives entered their professions to protect life, not to take it.  For the first time in Irish history, a Minister for Health is proposing to force doctors to refer women for abortions, forcing doctors to become involved in the abortion process against their conscience in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the legislation does not provide for any positive right for conscientious objection.  It merely states that nothing in the Bill shall be interpreted to oblige a doctor, nurse or midwife to participate in carrying out an abortion.  This means that employers and professional groups will still be free to impose a duty on doctors, nurses and midwives to participate in abortion.  That will put Irish healthcare professionals in a worse position than their colleagues in Britain.  The Abortion Act 1967 provides that no person shall be obliged to participate in an abortion.  At the very least, Irish law should include the same level of protection for conscientious objection as is outlined in the British law.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides no protection for pharmacists or other healthcare workers who may be required to assist or make arrangements for a medical abortion by way of pill or a surgical abortion.  The legislation provides no protection for medical or nursing students to ensure they are not required to train or be involved in abortions as part of the professional education and qualification requirements.  I believe that needs to be addressed in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days, it has been reported that the Minister for Health is considering reducing or eliminating the 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be carried out under the section dealing with abortion on demand.  During the referendum campaign, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, promised the Irish people that any abortion legislation introduced would contain safeguards.  The most important safeguard they referenced was the 72-hour waiting period, which the T&aacute;naiste called a cooling off period.  Many people cast their vote based on guarantees made by senior members of the Government.  They must be held to their words, and removal of the 72-hour waiting period should not be permitted.<\/p>  <p>  Minors who become pregnant are in a particularly vulnerable position.  Some may feel that they have no option but to have an abortion.  These young women deserve to have the support of their families during a difficult period.  The current abortion legislation does not contain any provisions which require that parents or guardians be notified if a minor in their care requests an abortion.<\/p>  <p>  During the referendum campaign, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, told the people that there would be counselling and support available for women who request an abortion.  These were described as part of the safeguards in the proposed legislation yet, despite these promises, there are no provisions in the Government&rsquo;s legislation to provide free and accessible counselling to women who are considering taking that course.<\/p>  <p>  There has been significant public disquiet in recent years regarding revelations that children&rsquo;s remains were buried in unmarked graves in Tuam and other places.  The dignity of the child&rsquo;s remains, at any age, must be respected.  When an unborn child&rsquo;s life is ended through abortion, the remains should be treated with dignity.  The Government has been critical of the way children&rsquo;s remains were treated in the past.  We must not repeat that in the future.  The dignity of the child requires that we adopt an amendment to the abortion legislation that prohibits any sale or any use of remains for scientific research without written parental consent and that ensures that the remains are treated with respect.<\/p>  <p>  During the referendum campaign, the Minister for Health promised the people that children with disabilities would not be targeted for abortion if the law changed, yet his legislation contains no prohibition of abortion based on disability.  That needs to be addressed also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700056#JJJ00300","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1539800100,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Deputy Scanlon has raised a number of the issues I wanted to raise so I will not make a long contribution.  Prior to the referendum, I made my view known on a number of points of concern to me but as has been said, the referendum was comprehensively passed by the people and I accept that.  However, that was the referendum and this is the legislation.  I have some questions regarding a number of doctors and some nurses who contacted me, some of whom were in favour of some form of legislation but now have concerns about the freedom of conscience provision, which has been adequately discussed by a number of speakers.<\/p><p>It has been brought to my attention by some medical people that in New Zealand there is an opt-in, opt-out clause.  Would it not be very reasonable, considering the issue of conscience this is for quite a number of medical people, that we would favour the opt-in, opt-out clause?  It should be taken on board by the Minister to give doctors that right.  They tell me they are going to have a serious issue in respect of freedom of conscience.<\/p> <p> During the debate prior to the referendum, a clear commitment was given about the 72-hour waiting period.  There are reports - maybe they are not correct and I am sure the Minister will clarify this point - that the elimination of that 72-hour period will take place.  That is regrettable and at the time, the T&aacute;naiste in particular promised people there would be safeguards, one of which was the 72-hour waiting period.  I feel very strongly about that.<\/p> <p> The area of ultrasound and the provision of ultrasound to women also has been brought to my attention.  It has been stated to me that the Government is not prepared at all for what it is introducing in this regard and the availability of proper ultrasound equipment is a very important point to some people; it should be available.  They are a number of areas about which I have had concern but that concern also has been expressed strongly to me, particularly by some doctors who did want some form of legislation.  In two or three cases, they told me they voted for legislation to be brought forward but that they have serious concerns now with parts of this legislation.<\/p> <p> There are cases where some people go for abortions and have a terrible regret.  We really must put emphasis on counselling.  I do not think we are prepared for that area at all although we were told prior to the referendum that it would be addressed.

That is probably because I am a member of the transport committee and the Minister, Deputy Ross, is not exactly a man who brings too many Bills before this D&aacute;il.  I must say that when the Bills have come before the committee in the past few months - one was a Bill that had only a couple of amendments on it - but before they went through Second Stage they got plenty of discussion by the various interested groups, not just in one meeting but over a few meetings.<\/p>  <p>  It is a shame that the Minister did not go through the process of pre-legislative scrutiny.  I do not see why there is a rush job on this.  The Minister will say the people have waited for decades to change this amendment but I note that while the eighth amendment committee came out with a recommendation, it did not have access to the heads of the Bill before we went to the country with the referendum.  I am sure there are some who have different thoughts on the whole legislation.  We go by the vote of the people but sometimes we like to play along with exit polls and what comes out of them and what was in people's minds.  The Minister acknowledges, for example, that one issue was about the 12 weeks and nearly half the people who voted yes in the exit polls had reservations about the 12-week issue.  What if these things had been discussed more in advance?  The decision has been made but the heads of the Bill should have been made more available and should have been discussed more.<\/p>  <p>  David Quinn of the Iona Institute acknowledged the day after the vote that we must accept defeat graciously.

As a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and in my role as a legislator I cannot help but think of what is going to be rushed through in this vote.  I am disappointed that little or no time is being allowed to debate the content of the proposed legislation thoroughly.  Before the referendum last March, the Minister, Deputy Harris, assured us that if the referendum passed, there would be ample time to debate any legislative proposals.  Now here we are, the ample time has been cut down to a few hours and it is not enough.  The Government wants this legislation rushed through.<\/p>  <p>  The referendum on the eighth amendment was one of the most divisive and contested we have had in Ireland.  For some people, their views changed while others deliberated.  It has been a decision that people did not take lightly and we need to dedicate more time to this legislation.  One big selling point of the repeal the eighth campaign was that the eighth amendment needed to be repealed in order for any change in the legislation to take place.  Many people have voted for change and repeal but without knowing the limit or the extent of these changes.  I believe that legislating for this is the most contested part and today it is being hurried.  In the long run-up to the referendum, many of my constituents got in touch with me and shared their many concerns about different aspects of abortion, some anxious for repeal on a variety of different grounds and others anxious to keep protection for the unborn.<\/p>  <p>  I have been taking a second look at the provisions of the proposed legislation and am very alarmed by some of its content.  I am shocked at how extreme the legislation is proposed to be, even though there were reassurances from the Government during the campaign.  It is not just about what is in the Bill but also what is missing in terms of any restrictions on abortion, most obviously the fact that abortion is permissible up until birth.  Many decided to vote yes last May in the hope that a restrictive regime would be put in place.  The question that keeps coming into my mind is what will my constituents say when they realise the abortion law they are being landed with is not the limited provision of abortion they were promised but one of the most unrestrictive abortion regimes anywhere in Europe and the wider world. <\/p><p>The legislation defines abortion as \"a medical procedure intended to end the life of a foetus\".  In one provision it does not need to be necessary to save the mother&rsquo;s life or safeguard her health; it is to be available on request with no reason needed.  The baby&rsquo;s humanity and value and right to life as a human being are absolutely ignored.<\/p> <p> The Government insists that abortion is just healthcare, but this is untrue.  This legislation allows abortions even where they are not a necessary treatment for the mother.  If they really wanted to show compassion and respect, and to treat the unborn as what he or she really is, a fellow human being, then the legislation would at least require that every reasonable effort should be made to save the life of the baby when treating the mother as our medical ethics has always required.  However, this law is about a right to have a baby killed on request with no reason needed.  There is no compassion, no respect and no concern for the unborn.<\/p> <p> If the Government really wanted to show compassion for the unborn then at the very least it would include a requirement on medical professionals to provide appropriate protection from the pain the baby feels during the abortion procedure particularly when the abortion is in the later stages.  However, the legislation as it stands contains no such requirement.  Can this one amendment at least be allowed for adequate age-appropriate anaesthetic and pain relief for the baby?<\/p> <p> We know from international experience that sometimes babies are born alive after failed abortions.  According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information there were 766 late-term live birth abortions - babies born alive after failed abortions - in the period from 2013 to 2018.  In Britain, 66 babies were born alive after abortion and left to die in one year alone.  This information was published by the Department of Health in the CEMACH report of 2007.  If we were serious about having respect for life, surely at the very least the legislation could include a provision requiring medical professionals to intervene and provide life-saving care to the baby.<\/p> <p> We know that some hospitals in the UK have refused to intervene and simply left the babies to die, which is a disgrace.  As it stands, this legislation has no such provisions.  I believe that the only right thing to do when this happens is for the doctors to be required by the legislation to intervene at once with life-saving care if a baby survives an abortion.<\/p> <p> The Government has repeatedly assured us that the legislation would not legalise abortion solely because of a baby's gender, or because a baby had Down's syndrome or suffered from a disability.  We know that all over the world these are grounds on which abortions are widely sought in other jurisdictions.  However, at no point does the legislation exclude these grounds for abortion.  What we have been landed with is much more unrestrictive than we were promised.<\/p> <p> Is abortion a medical healthcare procedure even though in the words of the proposed legislation it is defined as &ldquo;intended to end life of a foetus&rdquo;?  A doctor with a pregnant woman has two patients, the mother and the baby.  Are we expected to pretend it is acceptable for a doctor intentionally to end the life of one patient as healthcare for the other?  This Bill would legalise abortion on request up to 12 weeks - 12 weeks of the baby&rsquo;s life.  I will be voting against this legislation.  I will, however, support amendments based on what I have said, to try to limit the destructive impact this legislation will have on women and the unborn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700057#KKK00300","speaker":"1441","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539801300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille seo.  I begin by clearly stating that, as a pro-life republican Deputy, I am opposed to the Bill in its entirety.  After reading the Bill, reflecting on it and listening to the speeches made by party leaders in this Chamber, I have many questions and serious concerns.  Is it the intention of the Government and other party leaders to make this country the tourism abortion destination of choice?  Is the first principle of Irish unity that Dublin extends abortion services to women and citizens from the North?  That seems to be where we are heading with this Bill.  Just because a law is passed does not make it a just law.  The right to life is the most fundamental of all rights that exist.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Alveda King, the niece of Martin Luther King, once referred to it as a plan of wolf in sheep's clothing and of Trojan horse proportions.  She grouped abortion alongside infanticide, racism and oppression.  A nation that kills its own people has well and truly lost its way.  We face a serious violation of the civil rights of the unborn child.  How can the values and dreams of the Irish people survive if we kill our yet-to-be-born children?  This violation of civil rights is nothing short of an insult to the men and women of 1916 and it greatly undermines the values of the 1916 proclamation which makes reference to cherishing all of the children of the nation equally.  Of course, the parties in here have turned their backs on that Proclamation.<\/p>  <p>  Taxpayers did not vote to fund abortion and that includes many who voted to repeal as well as more than 730,000 who voted \"No\".  The results of a recent Am&aacute;rach opinion poll showed that 60% of people opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.  Maybe we need to have a second vote to find out if the people want to fund abortion.  As we all know, party leaders are adept at voting twice on the same issue.  The Nice and Lisbon treaties come to mind.  Why not the issue of taxpayers' funding of abortion?<\/p>  <p>  It is very clear that the electorate and the grassroots of the main political parties represented in this House have been duped and betrayed.  Instead of raising the standards of political representation and upholding values and Ireland's global national identity, one that sees us recognised as the gold standard for family with respect for life, party leaders have colluded to dismantle the people's constitutional protection for the most vulnerable, the unborn child.<\/p>  <p>  Long-held principles of respect for life which were once enshrined in our Constitution are being maliciously set aside.  To make matters worse, many good men and women in this House are being bullied into fear, silence and obedience.  The fear of not being reselected by party leaders has forced many to remain silent to the cry of the voiceless and submissive to an agenda that silences all opposing opinion or thought.  So much for freedom, equality, choice and compassion.<\/p>  <p>  As a pro-life republican woman, my conscience stands above and beyond any party diktat.  My conscience does not allow me to support policies of abortion and lack of freedom of conscience.  I am not afraid to stand before the voters in Laois and Offaly and keep or lose my seat, whatever the case may be, at the next election.  My constituents know me.  They know who I am and the values I uphold.  They know that they can trust me and they know that I will not do dirty political deals just for the sake of power or bow to populist rhetoric under pressure.<\/p>  <p>  The common good is being politically and systematically erased from society.  Now the Government seeks to brand decent people in every county as abortion funders.  If this House has no conscience, if this House does not respect and uphold the vital need to protect the unborn, if this House is deaf to the cries of the vulnerable and the voiceless, then this House needs to be pulled down and rebuilt because it is in decay.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to go.  It is better for the Government to go than for the whole nation to be lost and brought down.  I appeal to Members of this House to think for themselves, outside of leader diktat.  The Bill before us is extreme and harsh, and people need to speak up.<\/p>  <p>  Those who celebrated the vote in May and who are cheering on the legislation would do well to take a moment to consider the lives they are comfortable to destroy.  It is worrying that the Bill's definition of viability has become even more unclear at the precise moment when the scope of conscientious objection for health professionals contracts alarmingly.  For the thousands of pro-life doctors, nurses, midwives and pharmacists working in our healthcare system, this is deeply worrying.  I commend all those who came out today to protest against this injustice, because that is what it is - a grave injustice.  I stand with those health professionals who are being unfairly treated.<\/p>  <p>  Amid all the self-congratulatory tweets, selfies and posts, the Minister, Deputy Harris, seems to have forgotten that almost 750,000 of our people are on waiting lists in our health system.<\/p><p>Some of those patients are children waiting for scoliosis treatment or elderly people who have paid their taxes for 40 years and who are now waiting for hip operations.  It is a disgrace.  The Taoiseach may have forgotten about the health and the housing crises, as well as the difficulties which farm families are experiencing, how post offices in rural Ireland are closing, with communities declining, and how carers are unable to receive the help they so badly need.<\/p> <p> Freedom of conscience is not something which was unique to pre-repeal Ireland and it is not something which can be extinguished in post-repeal Ireland either.  It is a vital human right which is protected within our Constitution and, indeed, within the European Convention on Human Rights.  Throughout the world, many states which allow for abortion recognise the fact that a large number of workers in their healthcare sectors cannot bring themselves to participate in ending the lives of some of their smallest and most vulnerable patients.  In spite of the result in May, it is also abundantly clear that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people support freedom of conscience.<\/p> <p> Under the Minister's new plans, every pro-life doctor would be forced to refer patients to those GPs who they knew were ready and willing to help end the lives of vulnerable unborn children.  Let us take a moment to consider the situation facing pro-life doctors, nurses and pharmacists in dealing with requests for abortion pills.  They know they are dealing with not one patient, but two.  They know the second patient is in mortal danger and that they can do nothing to protect them.  Imagine, too, that the GP involved is being asked to aid in the destruction of that tiny developing life.  Imagine he or she is being asked to sign a form to help move their patients on to another step in the journey, a step which destroys one and wounds the other.  How could anyone ask that this doctor be forced to violate his or her conscience to such an enormous degree?<\/p> <p> In spite of public and professional support for protecting the rights of our healthcare professionals, the legislation the Government has proposed does not provide a positive right for conscientious objection.  What the Minister is proposing is not the same as that which exists in the UK.  It is, in fact, much worse.  Even Britain's infamous Abortion Act 1967, which has led to more than 8 million lives being lost over half a century, states that no person will be obliged to perform an abortion.  Under the current proposals here, however, employers and professional groups in Ireland will be able impose a duty on medical professionals to carry out these procedures which are so against their deepest beliefs about the sanctity of life and the importance of protecting it.<\/p> <p> I commend the Catholic hospitals on standing firm against this new penal law, which is not being introduced by British colonisers this time but by political leaders in this country who claim to uphold and respect all in society.  They do not respect them.  Not only could the legislation, as it is currently drafted, open the door to doctors, nurses and midwives being forced to participate in performing abortions, it also does not provide any protection for pharmacists, who may soon discover that they have no choice but to be involved in the dispensing of abortion pills to patients.  We owe it to our hard-working doctors, nurses, midwives and pharmacists not to force them to do things which go against their deepest beliefs.  That is why freedom of conscience must be respected within this legislation.<\/p> <p> By continuing down this destructive path, the Minister risks doing even more damage to the already creaking health service.  Unless conscientious objectors are protected within the law, we are going to lose hundreds, if not thousands, of our best and most hard-working and dedicated GPs, gynaecologists, nurses and midwives.  Our pro-life medical professionals, like all our other medical professionals, deserve thanks for all they do to care for those within society.  The least we can do is ensure they can continue to do this vital work without violating their deepest beliefs.<\/p> <p> It is also vital that there be no reduction in the mandatory 72-hour waiting period.  This was a core part of the proposals on which the Government fought its referendum campaign.  It is also vital that abortions are prohibited on grounds of disability.  Unborn babies with disabilities should be protected.  After all, we talk about an inclusive and accepting society with equality for all.  I am aware of the fact the group Disability Voices for Life has written to the Minister on this matter, seeking a meeting on a proposed amendment to the Bill.  I support its call for such an amendment to be made to this harsh and needlessly extreme Bill.<\/p> <p> The allocation of an initial amount of &euro;12 million of taxpayers' money is only the beginning.  This is a gross abuse of taxpayers' money.  That any Government would allocate taxpayers' money to selectively discriminate and bring about the end of the life of an unborn baby is not only an unethical breach of voter trust, it is abhorrent.  Such a Government is not worthy to represent or lead the Irish people.  It is time for change: time for a change of Government and also, perhaps, for a change of party leaders.  Nelson Mandela once stated, \"The time is always right to do right.  And as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people the permission to do the same.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700058#LLL00200","speaker":"1440","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539801900,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Before I address the legislation, I point out that I have listened to most of the contributions.  Even those who were opposed to the referendum taking place or opposed to the legislation, have all, bar one, in my opinion, recognised the will of the people on 25 May.  It is very unfortunate that there are still some within this Chamber who use terms during the debate on this legislation to suggest that people \"did not understand what they were voting for\" or were stupid.  That is grossly offensive to the electorate and I reject it.<\/p>  <p>  I canvassed my constituency, as I am sure other Deputies canvassed theirs.  We met people who were for and against the removal of the eighth amendment.  I believe it was a very civil debate at the doors.  I met many people who had not made up their minds or who had no clear preference before meeting canvassers, who were open to either voting for or against, and who were engaged with the canvassers on both sides.  I believe the vast majority of people who went out and cast their votes on 25 May did so from an informed position.  They were informed in a number of ways.  They were informed through the Referendum Commission, through the debates that took place on television and radio and through the canvassing teams for and against the proposal.  I find it incredible that some Deputies would insult the people by stating they were stupid or that they did not understand what they were voting for.  I think they should reflect on that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention Deputy Butler's contribution.  We all know what was Deputy Butler's position prior to the referendum.  She was very firm in that position and it has not changed in terms of her beliefs.  However, she came into the Chamber and gave a speech which was very difficult for her - we could see it was very difficult for her.  The type of leadership she has shown tonight in this debate is to be welcomed.  She has come in and said she accepts the outcome of the referendum.  She has difficulties with what is being proposed but she is going to support the legislation.  That needs to be recognised.  All too often, people who were opposed to this referendum were criticised for, in the opinion of some, opposing it for the wrong reasons or for ill-informed reasons.<\/p><p>If someone who campaigned against the referendum proposition comes to the House, accepts the will of the people and indicates support for the legislation and an intention to work constructively with the Government to pass the best legislation possible, that person should be commended.<\/p> <p> I note the call by some Deputies for pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  There is a slight contradiction in what they say.  On the one hand they say we should have pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill because it is such important legislation and would benefit from examination by the health committee.  In my experience as a Member of the D&aacute;il, the purpose of pre-legislative scrutiny is to ensure that what is proposed is good legislation.  In that context, one looks at all of the pros and cons.  However, this is a slightly different case because the general scheme of the Bill was published as part of the referendum campaign.  As such, people knew exactly what the legislation would look like.<\/p> <p> While it is not possible to say that it will be enacted word for word, the Government, in fairness to it, published the general scheme and has stuck to it.  Of course, in the course of its passage, the legislation may be amended.  However, those amendments will not be so fundamental as to change the general scheme of the Bill.  Indeed, the general scheme as published differed from what was proposed in the Oireachtas committee's report, in particular regarding the three-day provision.  It appears also that those Deputies who are demanding pre-legislative scrutiny are those who have difficulties with the legislation.  In the same breath in which they call for scrutiny, these same Deputies have stated that they intend to hold the Government to account to ensure that what was proposed in the general scheme of the Bill will not be changed.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot demand that the general scheme of the Bill be adhered to and at the same time assert that there should have been pre-legislative scrutiny to see if we could have changed the legislation.  There is a slight contradiction there.<\/p> <p> I sat on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and have spoken of my personal beliefs growing up and where I got them.  People often learn certain principles from their parents and my parents were pro-life and opposed to abortion in all circumstances.  Growing up, as I have said previously, I shared those views.  As a 46 year old man looking back at the 20 year old person I was, I know now from the information I have gathered as a legislator, from meeting advocacy and support groups and medical professionals, from sitting on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and from the debates in the House on the protection of life during pregnancy legislation that the beliefs I held strongly then, having been taught them through my parents, were ill informed.  I did not have all of the information and my views and beliefs were not based on fact.  Many people have said to me that I have been on a bit of a journey.  I remember what I said in reply to a woman I met in the course of the campaign when she said that.  I met her at her door and she was one of those women who had once had to travel to England to secure a termination.  She had followed the proceedings of the Oireachtas committee very closely and had known my personal position going back a number of years and how my views had changed.  She said to me, \"You have been on a journey and I thank you for that.\"  In reply, I told her that the journey I had been on was as nothing compared with the journeys undertaken by hundreds of thousands of women who were forced to travel by the eighth amendment.  I did not state that flippantly and I meant it genuinely.  If the journey I have been on ensures that no other woman has to take that journey, I have no regrets in supporting the legislation.<\/p> <p> I turn now to the position of my own party.  It is well known that there are differing views within the party as there are within every other party.  I am very proud of the way in which our party conducted itself in the lead-up to the referendum.  We had a very robust internal debate, the old workings of which were there for everyone to see.  The debate took place at a public Ard-Fheis which was open to the media.  No one was bullied into silence as was suggested here tonight.  No one was forced to adopt a position against his or her will.  Everyone had an opportunity to attend the Ard-Fheis, speak openly for or against what was proposed and to then abide by the decision taken.  That is what happened and it is on the record.  I might get into a slight bit of trouble for saying the following, but what the hell.  Even if the legislation is enacted in the morning, there will, unfortunately, be some women who still have to travel.  We must recognise that.  I am not saying we have to deal with that in this Bill.  We cannot do so because we gave a commitment to people on the general scheme of the Bill.  However, if some women will still be forced to travel, we still have some way to go as a society, as does Sinn F&eacute;in, before we recognise that and cater for every woman in every circumstance.<\/p> <p> There are a couple of things to say about the legislation itself.  I note the three-day provision.  It was not something which arose at the joint committee as Deputies Fitzpatrick, O'Reilly and Jan O'Sullivan will testify and it did not form part of the committee's report.  I understand the reasons for which it was included.  Some people have said it was done for political reasons and some people have cited other reasons.  While I understand why it was put in, however, it is important to ensure it does not become a barrier.  That is where the debate on Committee Stage must focus.  If it has been included for a very good reason, let us be confident in that reason.  However, I have learned over the last number of years, in particular as a member of the joint committee, that we must listen to the medical profession.  If the profession has concerns around the three-day provision, we need to listen, whether or not it is politically acceptable.  If there is a strong groundswell of opposition to the three-day provision, the Government must be open to it.  The last thing we want to do is pass legislation which makes things even more difficult for the medical profession in the provision of services.  We should be open on the three-day provision and we should obtain some guidance from the profession on it.  There is no doubt in my mind that the provision will impact more on certain sectors of society, including, for example, women in direct provision, women with disabilities, women from regions where the only available general practitioner has a conscientious objection and women who are victims of domestic violence.<\/p><p>The three days could prove problematic to these women and, as I said, we need to take the guidance on this.<\/p> <p> We should also be open to looking at the whole area of risk during the passage of the legislation.  The committee was very clear that risk and harm cannot be categorised.  I know the legislation refers to risk to the life of the woman.  It does not categorise the risk when it comes to the life of the woman but it does seek to categorise risk to the health of the woman.  We need an explanation as to why the Minister has decided to categorise this risk when all the evidence presented to us before the committee indicated that risk cannot be categorised and that this must be a medical judgment at a given moment in time based on all the circumstances.  This needs to be looked at, and I hope the Minister is open to doing so.<\/p> <p> Another area is the ancillary recommendations made by the eighth amendment committee.  I can completely understand why they are not in the primary legislation before us tonight.  Many of them will be policy decisions.  Some may not need to be in primary legislation and some may.  Some may need to be in regulations or secondary legislation.  A message needs to go out, however, that the Government is not cherry-picking the report, that there is a commitment, not just from the Government but from all parties in this Chamber, to fully implement the ancillary recommendations.  Just because they are not in this legislation does not mean they are any less important than the issue being debated within the Bill; it just means this is not the appropriate place in which to put it.  I am sure there is no rowing back on the Government's commitment on the ancillary recommendations and I look forward to working with Dr. Peter Boylan, who has been appointed to oversee the implementation or the preparation of the services, in this regard.<\/p> <p> I wish to make a point about viability because a number of Deputies have raised it.  Again I go back to what was discussed in the Oireachtas committee and the general scheme of the Bill.  I do not believe it is for us to put down a timeframe in primary legislation.  I know we have the provision regarding the 12 weeks but I am talking about the viability of the foetus in later stages of pregnancy.  Again, we need to be guided by the medical profession in this regard.  I am sure this issue will be dealt with in regulations or even Medical Council guidelines.  While some people have concerns about this, I think they are unfounded, and as we discuss the legislation and tease out all these issues through Committee and Report Stages, I think this will become more apparent.<\/p> <p> The very last thing I will say concerns a number of Deputies who spoke tonight and complained about not having enough time to discuss what is in the Bill.  There is no guillotine on this debate, to the best of my knowledge-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700059#MMM00200","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539803100,"counter":385,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700061#OOO00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1539803100,"counter":386,"content":"<p>-----and no guillotine will be put on this legislation.

Many people experience a level of darkness and difficulty that I will never experience myself.  I believe that our approach to these families - our friends, our neighbours and our relations - should be founded on compassion.  While it is impossible to discuss this issue without using some language that some people will find contentious, it is never my desire in any way to be seen to be making judgments on anyone's decisions surrounding this issue.  However, I believe passionately that the solution for one person can never be the ending of a life of another human being.  I believe that every single individual should have an equal right to life.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first time I have had a chance to speak on this matter in the House since the referendum, so I wish to offer a heartfelt thank you to everyone involved in the right to life campaign in recent years.  More than 100,000 people throughout the Twenty-six Counties were involved in one of the largest people-powered campaigns in generations.  Ordinary people on the pro-life side marched in their hundreds of thousands, distributed leaflets, knocked on doors, designed and created social media and lit up the streets with their campaigning abilities.  They did so without the support of any political party or media.  In fact, in many cases the pro-life campaign faced hostility from political parties, individuals and the media.  They should realise that they did an amazing thing, and I have no doubt but that these activists will be considered heroes by future generations for standing up for life because life is the most valuable thing we have.  They fought for the most vulnerable people within society, that is, unborn children.  Many of these campaigners are broken-hearted and many have their heads down and are wondering what to do next, but disappearing is the wrong decision.  Disappearing will simply give licence to those who seek to radically deregulate abortion further.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that 723,632 people voted \"No\" in the abortion referendum.  This is higher than the total vote in the most recent general election for both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il and higher than the total combined vote for Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, the Anti-Austerity Alliance, People Before Profit, the Social Democrats and the Green Party.  That is a massive chunk of individuals.  Taken on an all-Ireland basis, the right to life vote pushes to around 1.2 million or 1.3 million people.  It is a minority, but a significant minority and a minority that has a right to participate respectfully in this debate in the future.  It should not be censored or vilified by any individual or politician or the media.<\/p><p> Last week, I listened to Deputies such as Thomas Byrne who, almost in a state of panic, demanded that we push this abortion Bill through Leinster House as fast as we could.  He stated that the people had spoken, the Bill as laid out was sacrosanct and the voice of the people was sovereign.  The Deputy was right on the last point, and it is clear that a large majority of people voted to repeal the eighth and that the democratic will of the Irish people must be respected.  Abortion will be made legal in Ireland and we have to accept that, but the Deputy is wrong that the people voted for this particular Bill.  I have a different view than my party colleague on this, as it is untrue.  The chair of the Referendum Commission, Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy, stated before the referendum that the vote was simply to repeal the eighth amendment only.  She made it clear that, legally speaking, the vote was not on the legislation and that deleting the eighth would leave it to the Oireachtas to legislate on the issue.<\/p> <p> Every politician worth his or her salt around here likes to interpret the result of a referendum.  Indeed, one's interpretation of a referendum result cannot usually be contradicted.  In this case, though, it can be.  RT&Eacute; carried out an exit poll on the day of the referendum that was approximately four times the sample size of the normal opinion polls that consume the minds of politicians.  Like all decent opinion polls that give a snapshot, there was certainly a margin of error.  It was actually on the pro-repeal side, as many right to life voters were shy that day.  The exit poll scientifically asked whether, if a majority of voters voted \"Yes\" to the referendum, the Oireachtas would still be able to implement strict restrictions on abortions in Ireland.  Of those polled, 60% agreed with that statement.  Crucially, on the question of whether voters favoured abortion without restriction up to a gestational age of 12 weeks, the majority in Munster, Connacht and Ulster did not agree with that aspect of the Bill.  Across the State in total, roughly 50% of the people who voted on that day stated they did not agree with abortion on demand.  Is that not incredible?  With all the talk in the Chamber that the people knew exactly what they were voting for and were voting on every minute element of the Bill, the opinion polls state that that is factually incorrect.  It goes further.  Of \"Yes\" voters, 20%, or over 250,000, said that they did not agree with abortion being available on demand.  Referendums are simple issues.  They are binary questions - people are asked to vote \"Yes\" or \"No\", but they definitely cannot be asked to vote on each minute aspect of a Bill.<\/p> <p> People say that there should not be opposition to this Bill.  If one wants to make bad law, the best way to go about it is to delete democratic opposition within this Chamber.  Opposition is a form of test during a Bill's development.  It is a rigorous way of ensuring that the legislation will function.  No one should be shy to challenge this Bill rigorously.<\/p> <p> Deputy Thomas Byrne's desire to get this through the D&aacute;il as fast as possible is more about the civil war within Fianna F&aacute;il on this and other issues than the sovereignty of the people.  What he has forgotten is that, even if the Bill passes, this issue will not go away.  Once we cross the Rubicon regarding life and take the massive decision, which the Minister has done, to move from a position of every human life being protected in law to one in which we can legally end human life, restrictions become increasingly meaningless.<\/p> <p> Deputies have admitted that they are on a journey.  There is no doubt in my mind that they will continue on that journey over the next while.  There is still a strong pro-abortion lobby looking to push for further deregulation.  Mark my words - abortion will be a live political issue for years to come.  The pro-life Deputies who believe that, by keeping their heads down now, this will go away are mistaken.<\/p> <p> I wish to turn my attention to the position in the Bill.  The Bill defines abortion as \"a medical procedure which is intended to end the life of a foetus\".  That is the most important sentence within the Bill.  The Minister must agree that it is a sobering line.  Did he ever think that he would end up voting for that particular line to be put into legislation or that it would be a part of his legacy?  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, said in the media that it was not a life, but a \"potential life\".  That is not what the Bill says, though.  It says that it is an actual life.  That is all that any of us has.  I always bang on in the Chamber about how every time we vote on a particular issue, we are directly responsible for what happens as a result.  If we vote for this legislation, we will be directly responsible for the outcome of that clause each time.<\/p> <p> It is interesting that the Minister, Deputy Harris, continually couches this in terms of being a step forward for women's healthcare.  It is staggering that he is making sometimes giddy videos regarding such steps forward while there are 350,000 women languishing on waiting lists in the healthcare system.  It jars with many people that millions of euro of taxpayers' money will be spent providing abortions that they conscientiously oppose while it seems that no money can be found for emergency scoliosis operations for children or-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700061#OOO03700","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539803700,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Cataracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700062#PPP00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1539803700,"counter":423,"content":"<p>-----to house the 4,000 children who are homeless.  According to a recent poll by Am&aacute;rach Research, voters are opposed to taxpayer-funded abortions, including 44% of \"Yes\" voters.  It is no wonder.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister campaigned for this.  He stated that it was about choice.  Now he is looking to take choice away from doctors and apply a penalty - I am not sure whether it will be a criminal penalty - if they do not fulfil their requirements under this legislation.  The Bill compels doctors who do not want to perform abortions to participate in a process to make arrangements for abortions to happen.  Where is the choice for doctors not to participate?  Doctors are not trained or equipped to carry out this.  Most get into the profession to save lives, not end them.  Interestingly, the Oireachtas committee on the eighth heard evidence that the vast majority of abortions were for socioeconomic reasons and that only a small minority were for medical reasons.  Despite this, the Minister is forcing doctors and other healthcare workers to participate.  Anyone who is listening to this debate should think about it.  Imagine if the Minister said that someone's office would be forcibly turned into an abortion clinic or be used to facilitate arrangements for abortions.  Most people listening to this debate would be horrified, but that is exactly what is happening in the medical profession.  It is a serious flaw in the legislation.  God knows that the GP system is already stuffed and at breaking point.  The Minister is telling those who oppose this legislation to leave the profession or to do what they are told.  It will bring hundreds of law-abiding doctors into conflict with the State.  According to the Am&aacute;rach Research poll, the majority of adults were opposed to this.  This element of the Bill will come a cropper in the Supreme Court as well, so I advise the Minister to do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  I will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage in an effort to remove some of the most damaging elements of the Bill.  The Minister made a number of statements during the campaign that should be translated into definitive legislative safeguards.  One of my main difficulties with abortion is that it impacts minorities far more than others.  If someone is female, has a disability, is from an ethnic background or is poor, that person is far more likely to be aborted.<\/p><p>When the Minister was campaigning for this Bill, he said that nobody would be allowed to have an abortion in this country on the basis of disability.  On that basis, I ask him to support a definitive amendment to prevent abortion in the case of disability.  I suggest we should translate the Minister's pre-referendum promise into an amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700062#PPP00300","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539804300,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1539804300,"counter":426,"content":"<p>It is estimated that there are 100 million missing women in the world at the moment due to gender-related abortion or infanticide.  The Labour Party in Britain is currently seeking to outlaw gender-selective abortion.  I ask the Minister to support an amendment that would definitively outlaw gender-selective abortion in this country.<\/p>  <p>  It is generally agreed that the minimal necessary neural pathways for pain are in place at approximately 24 weeks' gestation.  Many experts now understand that those pathways may be in place prior to 24 weeks' gestation, which would mean that pain can be experienced at that stage.  I ask the Minister to make it unlawful for an abortion or any harm to be carried out on an unborn child who can potentially feel pain.  We need to deal with this important question.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to refer to one of the most heartbreaking elements of abortion.  It happens in most abortion regimes that an abortion is unsuccessfully carried out and the child who survives is seriously injured.  In some cases, he or she passes away.  It would be humane for the Minister to require the healthcare professionals who are gathered around to attempt to save the life of such a child and make sure he or she is protected into the future.  I had the pleasure of meeting an abortion survivor from the US when she came to Ireland.  She went through the experience I have described.  If a nurse had not removed her from the cold silver dish and helped her at the time, she would not be alive today.  I think it would be worthwhile for the Minister to include an amendment to cover such cases.  According to a poll carried out by Am&aacute;rach Research recently, the vast majority of Irish people are in favour of medical intervention in the circumstances I have described.<\/p>  <p>  Information is the key to this issue.  In fairness to the British authorities, they are very good at collecting information from their abortion services.  Many people on the pro-choice side have been using those statistics for years.  I am concerned that we might purposely fail to collect enough information at the required level in this country, perhaps to hide this issue.  I suggest that for the sake of the women and children, and for the sake of policymakers, politicians and the general public, it would be wise to ensure all the information that is generated on foot of the Government's plan is collected on an annual basis.  We should be able to review that on a regular basis as well.<\/p>  <p>  We often hear people talking about choice and information.  I believe really good information is important for informed choices.  I suggest that a woman who is considering having an abortion should be offered the possibility of seeing an ultrasound before she proceeds.  I am not saying she should be forced in any way to look at an ultrasound, but the option of doing so should be available to her.  This should be provided for in the legislation before the House.  Approximately 80% of those who participated in the Am&aacute;rach Research poll said they would support such a provision.<\/p>  <p>  I have to ask the Minister a couple of questions about the Bill.  Will the parents of a child who seeks to have an abortion be responsible for deciding whether the abortion is proceeded with?  If not, will the child's parents be notified of the decision whether to have an abortion?  I know this is a grey area in other elements of medical practice.  I want to see where the Minister stands in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Our previous conversation about whether people voted exactly on the basis of this Bill reminds me that when I spoke to a number of Deputies about this legislation recently, I was interested to find out that two of them did not know it allows for abortion to be available up to 24 weeks.  It is worth bearing in mind that there is a lack of knowledge in this Chamber about what is at stake here.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to ask the Minister about the provisions of the Bill with regard to cases of children with life-limiting conditions.  The legislation refers to a condition that is \"likely\" to result in the death of the child within 28 days of birth.  What does the word \"likely\" mean in this context?  If we are talking about a chance of 51% or more that the child will not live beyond days, it is a very low bar because it will have a failure rate of approximately 49%.  I know of children who confounded the doctors when they were brought to full term.  They were fully healthy children even though the doctors had told their parents that they should consider abortion on the basis that the children had life-limiting conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Even though this Bill is coming to pass, it is really important for this country to offer the necessary supports to women who find themselves in really difficult circumstances.  The Minister needs to double down on investment in maternity services, perinatal hospice care, rape crisis supports, health services, housing, childcare and equal pay.  I remind the House that when a woman and her children were forced to stay overnight in a Garda station earlier this year, Twitter lit up with angry people asking how the woman in question dared to have children she could not afford.  Is this how things are going to be?  Is this the new Ireland - free abortions but no chance of a roof over one's head?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700063#QQQ00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1539804300,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Second Stage debate.  We are not here to rerun the referendum or to reargue the points that have been made time and again.  The debate has already been decided, not by this House but by the citizens of this country in a democratic vote on our Constitution.  An overwhelming majority of those who voted in the referendum earlier this year decided to repeal the eighth amendment.  That vote must be respected.  Our job is not to second-guess or question the result of the referendum.  Our job is not to question the decision that has been made by the people.  Our job is not to question the validity of the vote just because we may not agree with it.  Our job is to respect that vote and to give effect to it.  The eighth amendment is already gone - it went the day the vote happened.  As legislators, we must fill the vacuum that now exists with legislation.  That is the job we were elected to do.  We need to be reminded at times that our job is not about imposing our personal views to try to supersede the will of the people.  While we may hold very dear personal views on this divisive issue, the will of the people was very clear in this case.  The referendum was not decided by a small margin.  The \"Yes\" vote in favour of repealing the eighth amendment was a substantial one.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we have had a long and difficult debate about this issue, not just in the past two years but over many years.  It can be argued that we have had a long and difficult debate on this matter since 1983.  It has been a very painful debate for many people, particularly those women who have been affected by this issue.  Throughout the meetings of the Citizens' Assembly, the Oireachtas committee hearings, the debates in this House and the referendum campaign, the women who have travelled over the years had to sit silently while they looked at the posters and listened to the differing views expressed during the debates.  All of us in here and out there were discussing those women and their families and what they had been through.  We will never understand their experiences because we have not had to live them, whereas they are still living their experiences.  I do not mean to gloat or be triumphalist when I acknowledge genuinely that people on the other side of this debate felt as passionately about a \"No\" vote as I felt about a \"Yes\" vote.  I can imagine how difficult polling day and, in particular, the day of the count must have been for them.  Obviously, the exit poll was released on the night before the count.  I saw at first hand how upset people who had campaigned for a \"No\" vote were in the count centre in my constituency.  The views and beliefs that they hold genuinely for various reasons have to be respected.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that some people are very upset about the outcome of the vote in the referendum but that does not change the outcome, which was that our citizens, by a two-thirds to one-third majority, voted to repeal the eighth amendment and to provide for abortion services in this country.  They did that for numerous reasons.  All Members in this House have engaged with people not only in our own constituencies but across the country on all sides of the debate.  I refer to women who have been personally affected and had taken different views on this issue.  However, it is very important that we progress this legislation.  It has to come into effect.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the legislation is not to upset people.  It is to provide proper healthcare, maternity care and reproductive healthcare for the women of this country to stop the daily and weekly necessity of Irish women having to get on a boat or a plane and travel to another country to avail of its healthcare system.  Something that people were slow to admit and accept was that we already had abortion in this country.  We have abortion in this country.  Women have abortions in this country every day, every week.  If they cannot afford it or find they are unable to travel, they procure the abortion pill online.  Maintaining the eighth amendment or the <i>status quo<\/i>, therefore, was not going to stop or change that.  What it meant was that we were happy for people to travel to avail of a healthcare system in another country, that we did not want to deal with it here and that we were happy to avail of the ease with which people could travel to the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions to avail of a service that should be available to our women in their own country.<br\/><br\/>That journey has a lasting impact not only on the woman in question but on her partner and on the family.  That impact does not go away.  I can imagine the pain that must have been felt when this campaign was ongoing for people to have all of that brought up again, to have to deal with that and face it every day, perhaps sitting on a bus as they commuted to work, looking at those posters and reading that commentary.  It was unpalatable, unsavoury and cruel at times.  Some of it was so debased and it was so unnecessary.  One would have to question the motives of those people and what their intention was.  I would have to question how those people who designed those posters really felt about women.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the situation that still currently prevails, in the absence of this legislation and if we take our time getting it through the House, we are continuing to force women to travel, women who are given a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality, that devastating news, and finding that there is no place to go, no advice or help available in their own country.  The medical team and doctors who have been with the woman all the way through suddenly find that they cannot talk to her.  They cannot even refer her.  They cannot help her.  That is happening today, it will happen tomorrow, and the day after.  While there is no guillotine on this debate, I urge Deputies to be respectful, to have their say but not to try to filibuster the debate.<br\/><br\/>I disagree with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n that the referendum was just about repealing the eighth amendment and that the Bill before us had nothing to do with that vote.  Clearly, there was a reason the Bill was published.  We discussed at the Oireachtas committee that there was a need to publish the proposed legislation in order that people would know for what they were voting.  The heads of the Bill were published for that reason.  There was good engagement.  There was a very high degree of understanding and knowledge of what was being proposed in terms of what would happen in the event of a repeal vote and the eighth amendment being removed.  People understood the 12-week proposal.  They understood what was allowed up to 12 weeks and what was permitted after that.  That was because the heads of the Bill were published and that discussion took place.  It is disingenuous and incorrect to say that the Bill did not inform the way they voted or that it was not part of the context.  Of course, it was.  As a result of that, it would be incorrect to try to substantially change the Bill in this House today or on any other occasion because it would go against the will of the people and for what they voted.<br\/><br\/>It appears from some of the debate in the House this evening and some of the commentary outside these four walls that some people are now seeking to restrict the remit of the Bill, of what it is capable of enacting and, in turn, trying to restrict women's access to proper reproductive healthcare and women's choice.  Ultimately, that is what it comes down to, a woman's right to choose what happens to her, to her body and to her future.<br\/><br\/>A constituent told me recently that he strongly believed there should be a psychiatric test for any woman seeking to avail of an abortion because, clearly, she could not be of right mind, she must not know what she is doing and she must not have thought about it.  It is that kind of insulting, derogatory opinion that has led hundreds of thousands of women to take the stand they have taken, to say it is their right to choose and they will have the only say over their future.<br\/><br\/>This comes down to trusting women.  The suggestion has been made that because it is a little handier to procure a termination in that the woman will not now have to order the pill or make that trip to the UK, it will be a more flippant decision to go ahead and have an abortion because it is a little easier to get one than it used to be in the past.  That kind of commentary is degrading and insulting to women.  No woman takes that decision lightly.  Every woman who gets to the point where she wants to procure a termination or have an abortion for whatever reason has thought long and hard about that decision.  She has her own reasons and they are hers alone.  They are not mine or those of other Deputies.  It is not for me, or anybody else, to judge in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The suggestion was made in the House earlier that the mother and the unborn have an equal right to life.  It is simply not possible because the two are interconnected.  When we face a difficult decision where a woman's health is severely at risk or where she has been raped and is pregnant as a result of that rape, or where there is a fatal foetal abnormality and for whatever reason the woman believes she cannot continue with that pregnancy, how can the rights be equal?  They cannot.  There has to be a judgment call and the best person to make that call is the woman herself.<br\/><br\/>Is the solution in those situations where a woman has been raped to force her to remain pregnant against her will?  Is that the suggestion of Deputies in this House?  Do they believe that is humane and is respecting her rights, her bodily integrity, her right to decide her future and to have control over her body when that control had been taken away from her to lead her into that situation?  Is that really the solution, a forced pregnancy?  Clearly, the majority of our citizens said &quot;No&quot; to that, that it was not a solution and should never be one.  Our citizens trust the women of this country to do the right thing.<br\/><br\/>I want to take this opportunity to thank the many medical practitioners who advocated so strongly and eloquently in favour of repealing the eighth amendment, not on a populist basis or a personal view but on a medical basis.  The clearly told us in committee time and again that they felt hamstrung in their ability to do their job, which is to provide proper healthcare for women in this country.  It is well documented and well evidenced that women in this country have lost their lives because of our abortion laws.  Without question, that has happened.<br\/><br\/>That brings me to my next point around trust.  We have to trust our doctors.  I trust our doctors.  I found their evidence to our committee and the advocacy with which they engaged to be extremely persuasive.  I trusted that they were coming from a position where their ultimate goal was to care for their patient and ensure that every woman in this country has access to the best of medical treatment whenever she needs it.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the terminology being used by some speakers, such as that if one voted &quot;Yes&quot;, one is somehow pro-abortion.  It is not about being pro-abortion or wanting to advocate for that choice.  It is about trusting women, trusting our doctors and allowing the woman in question who finds herself in that position, for whatever reason, to make that choice for herself.  We do not need to go down a road where we want to further control women and doctors as they navigate that most complex situation.<br\/><br\/>As I said, this is not a flippant decision that anybody makes and no one should stand in judgment of any woman because we do not and will never know her situation.  However, the choice should be respected both ways.  If a woman chooses to continue with her pregnancy in very difficult circumstances, if she is given a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality and wants to continue with that pregnancy, she and her family should be given every support to do that.  There should be proper services, including counselling, in place and every support that woman should ever need.  Equally, if the woman chooses not to continue with the pregnancy for whatever reason, the proper supports should be available in this country and that includes proper aftercare, something which has been lacking.<\/p><p>Today, for any woman who has travelled to the UK for an abortion or who has procured an abortion pill online, there is no aftercare, no support and nowhere to go.  That only compounds the hurt, pain and trauma even further, leaving women feeling like they are criminals in their own country for making a choice that they genuinely believe is the right one for them.<\/p> <p> Those advocating for more restrictive legislation and those still advocating for a No vote in a referendum that has since passed still cannot answer the questions around rape or fatal foetal abnormality.  Their advice is just to put the head down and get on with it.  That is the best option - to force a woman to continue with a pregnancy regardless of her circumstances.  I am very glad that our citizens took a different approach.<\/p> <p> Some of the concerns being raised by those seeking to restrict this legislation further include the idea that disability is a ground for a termination but it is not.  We had a debate on that at committee and voted against it.  It is not part of the legislation and it is very unfair to citizens to try to suggest that somehow it has crept in through the back door because it simply has not.  There was also a suggestion from some contributors that doctors will be forced to carry out terminations against their will.  Again, that is an utter lie.  It is not true and we should not be peddling such nonsense in this Chamber.  We should give due respect to the debate that we are having and tell the truth.<\/p> <p> There was commentary earlier about babies being left to die on cold, silver plates in some clinic but that is just utter nonsense.  It is not true and it will not happen.  That kind of commentary does not help anybody.  It does not help to progress the legislation or help us to have a proper debate and discussion on it.  All it does is serve to instill fear and doubt among people but I do not know for what purpose.  I really do not understand why anybody would suggest that such horrific things will happen because they will not.<\/p> <p> It is worth noting that this significant - even using that word is not significant enough - vote and referendum campaign has had a monumental impact on the women of this country and on the younger generation coming forward.  In the same year that we celebrate 100 years of women's suffrage and the progress that women in this country have made in that period, the debate on abortion has forced us to look back over a long and dark history when women suffered terribly.  If we look at the atrocities of the Magdalene laundries, the Tuam mother and baby home and other homes, we realise that it was not so long ago.  That was the very recent past.  I think that we have actually reached a critical mass in terms of political life and women finding their voice in the last number of years.  These issues force us to look as a country at how we treat women, how we look after them and how we facilitate their voices being heard and listened to, more importantly.  In that context, this debate has done us good.  We are now in a different space and are looking forward to a brighter future for women in this country and a brighter future for our country because of that.<\/p> <p> I genuinely hope that the service is put in place as soon as possible and is done properly, with proper consultation and that the medical profession is with us all the way.  We want this service to be in place, to work and be accessible to all women regardless of background, financial position and so on.  Any woman who needs this service should be able to avail of it.  We need to look at providing proper counselling for women who find themselves in that situation.  As a society, we also have to look at how we treat women and single mothers and young mothers in particular.  We also need to do an awful lot more around proper healthcare generally for women in this country.  The ancillary recommendations of the Oireachtas committee report were referred to earlier and it is really important that they are acted upon with a sense of urgency and are given priority.  We must provide better access to contraception, for example, which is still expensive, particularly for young women who are not working and are still at school or in college.  There are practical steps that we can take to try to limit the number of unplanned crisis pregnancies in this country and it is incumbent upon us as a State to try to do so.  It is also really important that we remove the stigma attached to being a single parent and to getting pregnant when young, as well as the stigma attached to having a termination for whatever reason one has one.  It should come down to personal choice.  We must respect other people's right and entitlement to make decisions about their own person and their own future.<\/p> <p> We must stop trying to control women and to guilt them.  Those days are over.  That is in the past and we will not take it any more.  We are in a new era where women are equal.  We have an equal seat at the table and an equal voice.  We will ensure that our views on women's issues and on wider societal issues impacting on our position and our participation in this society will be heard and listened to.  This debate proved that.  There was cross-party co-operation and we all worked together.  We put our political differences to one side and our objective was to secure a Yes vote in the referendum and then to see the safe passage of this really important legislation through this Oireachtas so that we can give effect to what was a democratic vote by the citizens of this country.  A two thirds to one third majority was in favour of repealing the eighth amendment.  It was an historic vote and I feel honoured and proud of the small part that I played in the process.  It is incumbent upon us now to ensure that we see the process through to its finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700063#QQQ00400","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539805500,"counter":430,"content":"<p>It makes me proud to listen to Deputy Chambers because what she has just said, as a young woman, represents where we have come to in Ireland.  It has been a long and hard struggle to get here but we are now at a point where women's choices have to be respected, where women are equal and can no longer be told in a paternalistic way what we can and cannot do.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke earlier about people on the \"pro-life\" - in inverted commas - side being vilified.  I consider myself as pro-life as anyone else.  However, he actually vilified the two Ministers who were in the Chamber at the time.  He made some very direct accusations about what, in his view, this legislation is about.  We all need to respect each other in this debate.  I certainly respect the fact that people have different views to mine but they cannot be allowed to diminish in any way the humanity and the values of people who have a different view, including the Ministers concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke about the fact that I am proud that we have got to this day today.  We had more or less a year of public debate on sexual and reproductive rights for women in this country.  Earlier today I co-chaired the launch of The Power of Choice - Reproductive Rights and the Demographic Transition, an annual report on the state of the world's population.  During the discussions today we heard statistics on African countries and on Tanzania in particular where women are still dying because they do not have access to contraception or maternal care in childbirth.  This is the world in which we live.  This document is all about ensuring that we give women throughout the world rights and choice, which is something in which I fundamentally believe.<\/p>  <p>  When Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke earlier about abortion he said that it is about killing.  I remember fighting for the right to access contraception in Ireland and having the same arguments put to me in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  At that time, we were vilified for seeking access to contraception.<\/p><p>There is nobody on that side of the argument who is stating that contraception is terrible and that we should not have it.  This is because they and the country have moved on.  We held a referendum.  We had been campaigning since 1983.  I campaigned then against the inclusion of the amendment because it was never appropriate to deal with this issue via the Constitution.  In the referendum, the people decided to remove it from the Constitution.  Technically, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is right when he says that what we voted on in the referendum did not specifically include the legislation we are debating.  The very reason for publishing the legislation was that the public would know the intentions of the Government and the Oireachtas following the decision of the people, who voted \"Yes\".  That is democracy.  The Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment did not recommend that disability be a ground for abortion.  That is reflected in the legislation.  We need to nail that piece of misinformation which has been uttered in the House tonight.  It is not a ground in this Bill.<\/p> <p> I congratulate everybody involved in the Together For Yes campaign, which was extremely invigorating and very participative.  It was dominated by people from all sections of the community who, in many cases, do not belong to political parties.  However, there were also those of us who are in political parties.  I am very proud of my party.  It has held a consistent position on this issue to the effect that the eighth amendment needed to be taken out of the Constitution.  I am very proud to have played my part in ensuring that we got a \"Yes\" vote.  This was for the people.  They were given the facts.  We held debates, first at the Citizens' Assembly, then at the Oireachtas committee and then in the context of the referendum campaign.  People had the opportunity to know exactly for what they were voting.  That is why we have the legislation before us.<\/p> <p> As a democrat, I believe everybody has the right to table amendments and express his or her views.  I agree, however, that people should not filibuster.  It is not the way to deal effectively with legislation.  Whether a person agrees or disagrees with legislation, he or she can put forward amendments if he or she wants to change it.  However, he or she should not unnecessarily delay the debate by using repetitive phrases and so on.  I urge those who may wish to table amendments to speak to those amendments but not to delay the business of the House.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health stated that he is negotiating with GPs in respect of their contract and that would include ensuring that they will be in a position to play their part appropriately in the context of the legislation.  When he is replying, I hope the Minister will provide some information regarding progress on that matter.  My information, from the GPs to whom I have spoken, is that the majority of them are quite willing and able to participate.  They need the necessary supports.  The Bill states that GPs can conscientiously object.  In other words, they will not have to provide the service but, if that is the case, they will be obliged to refer patients to other GPs.  That is appropriate.  It is the right of the woman who comes to the GP to have a service that is legally available in her country.  She should be entitled to that.  While the conscientious objection clause is included in the Bill, it is appropriate that there must be a referral to somebody else.<\/p> <p> The Minister also stated that clinical guidelines are being drawn up for medical practices, particularly where the referral moves on to the hospital setting where it is not appropriate for the GP to be involved because of the number of weeks of gestation, etc.  Will the Minister give us information on those clinical guidelines and progress?  I know the general intention is that this should be ready to go by 1 January.  Both of those measures will need to be well in place and properly organised by then.<\/p> <p> The Minister also spoke about communicating with the general public and having a communications strategy.  We need to ensure that is available and that it is clear because the general public needs to know exactly what is available and what can be done in this situation.<\/p> <p> Various people have said that while the woman is never to be criminalised, as I understand the legislation, there are certain offences.  They are very upfront in the Bill, I think they are in section 5 and others have suggested that they may be further on in the Bill.  It is somewhat off-putting when reading the Bill to see that straight after the Title, the definitions, regulations and expenses, the next section is offences.  It might be appropriate to have the more positive elements of further up in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700065#SSS00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539806100,"counter":432,"content":"<p>There is nothing positive about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700066#TTTT00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1539806100,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The ancillary recommendations are vital.  Hand in hand with the terminations being available, there has to be also the appropriate education and access to contraceptives without barriers of affordability.  I assume that aftercare will be dealt with in the clinical guidelines and the arrangements with the medical profession.  The ancillary recommendations are very important to ensure that there are appropriate options available to women that do not have to include termination, that they can access contraception.  The committee was informed that for terminations where there is aftercare very often there is a reduction in abortions, particularly repeat abortions.  The statistics in Britain show that there are more repeat abortions among Irish women than their British counterparts because they do not have the aftercare and advice on contraception that comes following a termination.  It is very important that access to aftercare be available to Irish women.<\/p>  <p>  I have contributed to the debates following the referendum and I have had the opportunity to raise various issues at committee meetings.  There is a great deal more that could be said.  Deputy Lisa Chambers has gone through the various issues that arise regarding fatal foetal abnormalities, women who have been raped and serious risks to the woman's health or life.  The definitions section does not define \"serious\".  I am not sure how that is to be interpreted.  The committee mentioned only health but did not say \"serious\".  There is a definition later in the definitions section that health includes mental health, which is welcome because we need to ensure it is taken seriously and that there is not some kind of distinction between physical and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on it.  My political life pretty much started in the early 1980s when we were fighting for access to contraception and trying to keep Article 40.3.3o out of the Constitution.  This is very much the coming of age of Irish society, where we, as women, are accepted as equals, where our reproductive health and rights are treated as genuine rights and not as things that can be paternalistically given to or taken away from us.  It is our decision about our bodies and there will now be legislation to provide for the exercise of that right by all Irish women within the terms of that legislation.<\/p><p>That is very welcome and a sign that we have come to maturity and recognised the reality that Irish women have been having abortions, whether going to Britain or taking pills they have got over the Internet.  We need to ensure that we pass this legislation.  We should give it the appropriate scrutiny but we should provide this service for Irish women as equals in our own country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700066#TTTT00300","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539806700,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Measaim go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an mBille seo, ach go h&aacute;irithe tar &eacute;is do Theachta &oacute; mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; labhairt romham, agus an chuma ar an mh&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; aige go bhfuil s&eacute; i gcoinne na reachta&iacute;ochta seo.  I can state wholeheartedly that Sinn F&eacute;in endorses this Bill despite the comments from Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  We will do our damnedest to ensure this Bill will come into effect at the earliest possible opportunity.  I know the committee is already willing and able to receive this Bill to deal with Committee Stage on 7 November and I wish it well.  Much of the debate that has been had here tonight needs to be had in that forum.  We had alternative views on, for example, what Deputy Jan O'Sullivan just mentioned, with section 5 to be moved to the more appropriate part of the Bill as is the norm in legislation.  We can have that debate and not unduly delay it.<\/p>  <p>  What is the people's voice?  The people have spoken.  Some 64.1% of the people voted in favour of a proposal which had the endorsement of the vast majority of Teachta&iacute; in this House.  In my own constituency, although it was a low turnout compared with elsewhere, it was a high turnout for a referendum and much higher than I expected at the outset.  Dublin South-Central was one of the top ten constituencies which endorsed the proposal which was proposed by all parties in the constituency.  Some 74.91% voted for it.  I am happy with that and that I played a small part.  It was perhaps not as much as I should have but I played my part.  I found that very rewarding.<\/p>  <p>  I, like many other Deputies, was not involved in the preparatory committees, which received the Citizens' Assembly's report and teased out properly, in full public view, the very complex issues.  Medical issues can be very complex.  They teased it out and I congratulate them, as I have in recent months, for their diligence in that work.  They put it before the people and the Minister had the courage to produce legislation and explain to the public that this is where we are going and the idea that we have but that we first wanted the public, before we could publish and be specific with legislation, to remove a clause inserted in the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it was inserted at a time when Irish people could not speak out.  It was a different era.  While I was waiting, I was thinking back to when the eighth amendment was inserted into the Constitution.  It is sometimes very hard for people to remember that far back.  One has to remember the society that we had before and after that.  We have learned some of it since.  We have had quite a number of clerical sex abuse reports which emerged after that.  The huge scandals which we now in some ways take for granted were hidden in that era.  In the background, people were afraid to speak out against the institutions of the State or those who they felt the State was protecting, whether in Cloyne, Tuam or a range of other places.  Remember Ann Lovett in Granard or Eileen Flynn in Wexford, a woman who was sacked from her job because she had the audacity to live with the father of her child, who was separated.  She subsequently married him and had four other children.  She was sacked because she had the audacity to infringe upon the morals of society.  The Kerry babies case was another.  Divorce was another issue.  What the hell were we doing?  People were not allowed to divorce.  The whole world was going to collapse if we voted in divorce.  That is the way it was presented by some of the very same people who will now say that if we introduce this legislation, our society will collapse around us.  Homosexuality is another example.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have been lucky with the public because they are willing to talk and we have given them the opportunity to talk in referendums.  We have had civil partnerships, marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment.  The numbers turning out for referendums in the recent past is way beyond what I remember in the 1980s and 1990s.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was correct when she was talking about people looking for condoms to be sold.  The whole world was going to collapse because the poor sperm could not get anywhere.  They are alive and well, going by the number of kids I see day in and day out.  The world has not collapsed because we have the maturity to debate these issues and reflect them in our laws.  There is a whole range of issues and that is part of the context.<\/p>  <p>  During the debate on the referendum, I found myself having preconceived ideas.  One would knock on a door and an elderly woman would answer.  Maybe this is due to my prejudices.  I would presume that this woman might have a go at me, being a churchgoer or whatever.  I found that the vast majority of women in my constituencies were delighted to talk to me on this issue, which was not the case in the past, and delighted that they were given an opportunity to vote yes.  I was pleasantly surprised and my prejudices were therefore shattered.  I was happy that that was so.  My colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, will represent Sinn F&eacute;in on the committee.  She alone will put forward amendments on behalf of our party.

Whatever Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said earlier is not a representation of our party which has, over the years, had quite a strong stance on repealing the eighth amendment, though maybe not as strong as some people would like.  We have had a debate virtually every single year on the issue of repealing the eighth amendment and we have been happy to be proven wrong in many ways.  We changed our position when the nuances of law were teased out by the Citizens' Assembly and then by the committee.  We do not decide in the parliamentary party.  Our members vote.  Coming back to the position that Deputy Mattie McGrath is hinting at, that this is not a democracy, for the last three years, our Ard-Fheis has taken a view that Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies will vote in unison on this issue because that is what the membership agreed.<\/p><p>They agreed by a bigger vote each year, despite the motions which were put to try to change it, so we will be in unison on this issue.  It is not undemocratic control.  It is quite democratic.  It is probably more democratic than many others who have spoken in this House on the opposite side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101700067#UUU00600","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539807300,"counter":441,"content":"<p>That is nonsense.

T&aacute; c&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad f&aacute;gtha agam chun cr&iacute;och a chur leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; agam.  As I mentioned earlier, t&aacute; an reachta&iacute;ocht seo &aacute; gn&iacute;omh&uacute; de r&eacute;ir na m&eacute;ide a d&uacute;irt 1,429,981 duine.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin beagnach d&uacute;bail ar an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; i gcoinne an mholta a cuireadh os comhair an phobail.  N&iacute; raibh m&oacute;ramh chomh m&oacute;r leis sin riamh go bhfios dom, seachas b'fh&eacute;idir an reifreann faoi Chomhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta.  Dar nd&oacute;igh bh&iacute; m&oacute;ramh n&iacute;os m&oacute; ann don reifreann sin.  Luaigh m&eacute; cheana go bhfuil athruithe ag teast&aacute;il chun an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os fearr.<\/p>  <p>  All legislation needs to be tinkered with to tighten it up and perfect it, which is the reason we have Committee Stage.  That is also the reason we went through the equivalent of a pre-legislative stage in the debates we have had.<\/p>  <p>  The people have spoken.  We will work with everyone in this House and in the Upper House to ensure the legislation and what it provides for is available as early as possible so that we no longer export our problem to England or elsewhere and that we are not importing another problem which astounded many of us, namely, the importation of abortion pills.  It is time that we address the issue once and for all in the open way society has demanded for many years.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; mise s&aacute;sta go bhfuilimid ag bogadh sa treo ceart agus go bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht seo ann.  T&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; ag teast&aacute;il le bheith d&eacute;anta maidir le sl&aacute;inte ban ach go h&aacute;irithe ins an t&iacute;r seo mar n&iacute;l go leor d&eacute;anta agus cuireann an reachta&iacute;ocht seo n&iacute;os m&oacute; br&uacute; ar an gc&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag imp&iacute; ar na hAir&iacute; agus ar an Rialtas a dh&eacute;anamh cinnte de nach mbeidh aon mhoill air seo toisc na fadhbanna sa ch&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte ach ag an am c&eacute;anna chun d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuilimid chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na scuainn&iacute; feithimh at&aacute; sna hospid&eacute;il agus na scuainn&iacute; feithimh at&aacute; ag fanacht ar obr&aacute;id&iacute; chomh maith c&eacute;anna.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to ensure the legislation does not add a burden on the healthcare system and that sufficient finances and resources are provided to ensure that the legislation can take full effect immediately and that the other healthcare issues are also addressed so that nobody can accuse us or the Government of diverting funds away from the health service, which is creaking at the seams.  This issue can be addressed within the current health framework if the proper resources are provided.
