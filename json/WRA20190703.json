There was a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices lasting from autumn 2018 to spring 2019, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.<\/p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. Building on this is the exchequer-funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019. <\/p>  <p>   My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP, and through the next Agri Food strategy to 2030.  This includes opening new opportunities for the sale of Irish beef on international markets and, in recent years, Irish beef has gained access to the US, Japanese, Chinese and other markets.  I have also provided additional resources to Bord Bia to promote beef in new and more traditional markets.<\/p>  <p>  My view is that such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300075#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 48 to 53, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300075#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[28234\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300075#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he continues to press for new markets for the agrifood sector with emphasis on replacements for those to be lost through Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is\u00a0 a constant and central component of the strategic development of the industry, as evidenced by its placement at the heart of\u00a0Food Wise 2025.

The Government's Climate Action Plan 2019 recognises the key role afforestation has\u00a0to play in climate change mitigation particularly through carbon sequestration.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan now sets a target of an average of 8,000 hectares of new planting per year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While\u00a0planting rates in recent years have been less than expected,\u00a0I believe this is due to a number of factors, including competiton for land and increasing land prices in recent years. The role of my Department is to secure an annual budget for new forests and also to act as the planning authority in assessing applications for these new sites.\u00a0It is worth noting\u00a0that we have approved an\u00a0average of\u00a09,000 hectares\u00a0per annum for afforestation over the last 3 years, but the conversion rate to planting remains on average around\u00a060% of the approval issued.\u00a0 This means the Irish forestry sector currently has at its disposal\u00a0almost 10,000 hectares\u00a0of\u00a0approved and shovel-ready land which could be planted today. The challenge is to ensure that all the effort that goes into securing and approving new sites results in those sites being planted, if the planting levels are to increase. <\/p>  <p>  In response, my Department has funded a number of new promotion initiatives. We are\u00a0funding Teagasc\u00a0to carry out a Forestry Promotion Campaign covering the period 2018 &ndash; 2020 specifically aimed at farmers. My Department has also funded a carbon navigator for forestry that will help illustrate to farmers the valuable contribution forestry can make in removing carbon from our atmosphere. This new tool will be launched later this year.\u00a0 Furthermore,\u00a0 15 promotion projects around the Country were approved earlier this year, which will roll out initiatives which highlight the multifunctional benefits of forestry, promote planting of more trees and encourage sustainable forest management. <\/p>  <p>  We also introduced higher rates and additional measures under\u00a0 the midterm review of the Forestry Programme in 2018, aimed particularly at boosting the planting of broadleaves and native woodlands. These measures have paid off and, so far, broadleaf planting has increased from 21% in 2017 to 27% in 2018.\u00a0There has been an increase in\u00a0Native Woodlands planted too,\u00a0with 172 hectares planted so far in 2019, up over 95% compared to the previous year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Another interesting development has been the\u00a0 launch of the Woodland Environmental Fund in September, 2018 This\u00a0 provides an opportunity for businesses to partner with the Government and Irish landowners and get behind the national effort to plant an additional 5 million native trees between now and 2020. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that we need\u00a0all actors to participate in the national afforestation programme, which is why I\u00a0\u00a0very much welcome Coillte's\u00a0recently announced Coillte Nature initiative. The primary objective of this initiative is to\u00a0deliver new woodlands which provide species diversity, biodiversity, have carbon sequestration potential and can be used for\u00a0enjoyment by the public.\u00a0\u00a0We have\u00a0had\u00a0active engagement with\u00a0Coillte on this matter and now \u00a0look forward to receiving applications for the\u00a0conversion\u00a0of a number of\u00a0Coillte's commercial forests to native woodland, which \u00a0may be funded\u00a0under the Native\u00a0Woodland Conservation Scheme.\u00a0I am aware too that Coillte has started discussions with Bord na Mona in relation to possibilities for a joint\u00a0venture to increase native forest cover on Bord na Mona lands, something which I am\u00a0 supportive of and\u00a0hope will contribute to our afforestation targets.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department also operates a community based woodland scheme called the Neighbourwood scheme. This Scheme is designed to help community groups, in cooperation with local authorities, to develop opportunities for recreation while creating and developing woodlands for the benefit of current and future generations. The scheme is also designed to provide outdoor classrooms for teachers to show children the important contribution forests make to society in terms of social, economic and environmental benefits.<\/p>  <p>  As can be seen, a range of approaches are being taken to address the challenge of increasing planting and\u00a0 especially the proportion of native and broadleaf planting. We will continue to offer generous grants and premiums to landowners to make the switch to forestry, we will use all avenues to promote and support that change, as well as supporting Coillte's endeavours\u00a0and we will examine how forestry can be better integrated into the new CAP.

The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. Other groups, most notably ISIS, have also perpetrated atrocities.\u00a0Over 6 million people are displaced inside Syria, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. As the conflict enters its ninth year, nearly 12 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, and more than 80 per cent of people live below the poverty line. <\/p>  <p>  In recent months, there has been an escalation of the conflict in the north-west of Syria, in the area around Idlib and northern Hama. Conflict there between the regime and other armed groups has killed over 230 civilians, has displaced more than 330,000 people, and has left hundreds injured. I condemn in particular the airstrikes, including barrel bombs, that are reported to have deliberately targeted medical facilities and schools. Those with influence on the Syrian regime have a responsibility to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. <\/p>  <p>  On 27 June 2019, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini issued a statement on behalf of the EU expressing deep concern over the situation in the north-west of Syria, strongly condemning the indiscriminate attacks on civilians, and calling on all sides to immediately cease hostilities, and to ensure the protection of, and unhindered humanitarian assistance, to the civilian population.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU support the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, is currently focusing his efforts on establishing a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country and unlock a broader political process. Such a process - which should be Syrian-led - will be essential to returning the country to stability. The UN Special Envoy has been engaging directly with Russia, Turkey and Iran on this, and we believe that they have a responsibility to support and assist his efforts. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response and our overall funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million to the crisis, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. To date, Ireland has disbursed &euro;138m of this funding. Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.<\/p>  <p>  Humanitarian aid will not solve the conflict, though it is important in mitigating its impact on ordinary people. Any sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict requires a genuine political transition, and at the EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting in February, I made this point to my EU and Arab counterparts.\u00a0Ireland and the EU firmly believe that eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[28387\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has conveyed concern to the administration of the United States of America regarding the detention of children and the conditions they are being subjected to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I and my officials are aware of changes in US migration policy, which has seen an increase in the detention of child migrants, particularly along its southern border.

Ireland is supportive of the implementation of policies globally which live up to the values of the CRC and, in this regard, I hope the situation for migrant children and families, around the world, can be improved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[28388\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the situation in Venezuela; the efforts being made by the EU and the international community to find a resolution to this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>The ongoing political, social, economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela continues to have a devastating effect on the Venezuelan population, and an ever-growing impact on the wider region. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation of Migration announced last month that the number of Venezuelans who have left the country since 2015 has now reached over 4 million.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The needs of the Venezuelan people are acute. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 25% of the population, approximately 7 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance. Health and medical needs are severe with many reported cases of diseases that had previously been eradicated or near eradication and a widespread lack of access to medicines and medical care.\u00a0Ireland is fully supportive of the UN-coordinated response mechanism for humanitarian aid in the country, and of the &euro;117 million in EU funding since 2018 for humanitarian assistance. <\/p>  <p>  I am also deeply concerned by reported human rights abuses in Venezuela. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet painted a worrying picture of repression and a lack of respect for fundamental freedoms in the country after her visit last month. However, I welcome the engagement of the Government of Venezuela with the Office of High Commissioner Bachelet, and that the Government has agreed that a small team of human rights officers from the Office can be based in the country in order to provide technical assistance and advice, as well as to continue to monitor the human rights situation there. I would urge the Venezuelan authorities to cooperate fully with this team, and to allow them unrestricted access so that they can fully carry out their mandate.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The recent death of army captain Rafael Acosta Ar&eacute;valo while in the custody of the Venezuelan security services further highlights the need for the human rights situation in the country to be addressed.\u00a0 It is another illustration of the arbitrary nature of the judicial system in the country and the lack of guarantees and rights for those under detention. I fully support the EU statement issued on 30 June that calls for a full and independent investigation into Captain Ar&eacute;valo's death, and that highlights the EU's support for the efforts of High Commissioner Bachelet to ensure that the human rights of all Venezuelans are fully protected.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Captain Ar&eacute;valo's death also underscores the urgency of the need to find a solution to this complex crisis. I continue to believe that this crisis can only have a political, peaceful, democratic solution, excluding the use of force, through the holding of free, transparent and credible Presidential elections as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The EU continues to work towards this goal, and Ireland fully supports the EU&rsquo;s International Contact Group&rsquo;s dual aims of finding a negotiated electoral path and of enabling the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance. I also welcome the recent appointment by EU High Representative Mogherini of an EU Special Adviser for Venezuela, Mr Enrique Iglesias. Special Adviser Iglesias will be well placed to engage with relevant stakeholders in Venezuela, and with international and regional actors, in the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also welcomes the talks process between the Maduro administration and the opposition, facilitated by Norway, that is currently ongoing in Oslo. Ireland, along with the EU, stands ready to support this process. I fully support the statement released by High Representative\/Vice President Federica Mogherini on 18 June, which underlines the EU's support for this process and calls on all Venezuelan stakeholders to engage in this process in good faith and to pave the way for its success through concrete confidence-building measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[28389\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent conference held in Bahrain to discuss Palestine and economic initiatives aimed at revitalising the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>The United States introduced the economic element of their long awaited plan for the Middle East Peace Process, entitled Peace to Prosperity, at a meeting described as a workshop, which took place in Bahrain on 25-26 June.

However, any potential investor or donor, public or private, will be very conscious that the main impediment to economic development for Palestinians, and the reason for the severe contraction of the Palestinian economy over the last two decades, is the web of restrictions due to the Israeli occupation. It is thus very difficult to discuss economic possibilities separate from the political context.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EU has encouraged the US in its efforts to develop a peace plan, and Ireland has done this in all our contacts with the US Middle East team.

In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation from April 2015. Revenue have also conducted random National Sampling Programmes in the years 2016 to 2019, to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud and the results of Revenue&rsquo;s sampling programmes support this view.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to solid fuel, I indicated in a recent PQ response that I am advised that Revenue is in contact at present with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel, for which that Department has responsibility, and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that solid fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here.

The main conditions are that the beneficiary must have lived in the house that was the sole residence of the disponer for at least three year prior to the inheritance and for six years after the inheritance and must not have an interest in any other house<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC04700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[28373\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if funding will be provided for the development of Nenagh Castle and surrounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>Nenagh Castle has already been fully conserved and is open to the public, so no further investment is therefore required in the historic building in the short term.   <\/p>  <p>  The question of rehabilitation and adaptation of the nearby two derelict houses on Pearse St. is currently under review in the context of future tourism development of the entire historic town quarter and once an appropriate strategy in relation to this has been agreed, an appropriate funding source will be identified and resources sought, since OPW has no monies available to it currently for any project at the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Refurbishment","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC04900"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[28603\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300077#WRC05000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the refurbishment works the OPW carried out at Garda stations in the Roscommon-Longford Garda division in which the value of works was in excess &euro;5,000 in 2018 and to date in 2019; the works carried out at each station; if the refurbishment works are completed or still ongoing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the Office of Public Works has carried out refurbishment works valued at greater than &euro;5000 in seven Garda Stations in the Roscommon Longford Division in 2018 and 2019.

This year&rsquo;s allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142m which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122m.  Since 2015 new apprenticeship registrations have increased by 80% with 5,648 new registrations by the end of 2018. In addition, following two calls for proposals in 2015 and 2017 by the Apprenticeship Council, to date twenty new apprenticeship programmes have been developed and are now operational to complement the existing 25 craft apprenticeships.<\/p><p>These include three chef apprenticeships in the hospitality sector in the occupations of commis chef, chef de partie and sous chef. A further programme in the occupation of executive chef is also in development and due to be rolled out in 2020.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that the structure of these new consortia led apprenticeship programmes are different to those in the craft trades. Our new consortia-led apprenticeships offer more flexibility to employers in meeting their skill needs both in the duration of the programme and in terms of the delivery of the off-the-job training. These new apprenticeship programmes vary in length from 2 to 4 years and have different methods of off-the-job training such as one day per week, as is the case with the chef apprenticeships, and on-line blended learning rather than the traditional block release of up to 22 weeks in an education setting, as is the case in the craft trades.  While there is no training allowance paid to apprentices undertaking one of our new apprenticeships, I am aware that some employers engaged in the system have raised this as an issue. However, any change in this regard, which has not yet been costed by the Department, would have to form part of the normal budgetary process and be considered in the broader context of competing demands and the overall availability of resources. <\/p><p>In addition to the apprenticeship programmes, there are a range of other programmes available in the hospitality area across further education and training and higher education settings. Similarly, there are employer-led training supported through Skillnet Ireland, such as the Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet, which was established in 2017, and the Taste 4 Success Skillnet to address skill needs in the sector. <\/p><p>Details of apprentice population per apprenticeship programme as requested by the deputy are set out in the following tabular statement.  <table><tr><th colspan=\"5\">Apprentice Population<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>20 New Apprenticeships developed Since 2016<\/td><td>2016<\/td><td>2017<\/td><td>2018<\/td><td>2019*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AUCTIONEERING<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Auctioneering &amp;amp;

This year&rsquo;s allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142m which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122m.  Since 2015 new apprenticeship registrations have increased by 80% with 5,648 new registrations by the end of 2018. In addition, following two calls for proposals in 2015 and 2017 by the Apprenticeship Council, to date twenty new apprenticeship programmes have been developed and are now operational to complement the existing 25 craft apprenticeships.<\/p><p>These include three chef apprenticeships in the hospitality sector in the occupations of commis chef, chef de partie and sous chef. A further programme in the occupation of executive chef is also in development and due to be rolled out in 2020.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that the structure of these new consortia led apprenticeship programmes are different to those in the craft trades. Our new consortia-led apprenticeships offer more flexibility to employers in meeting their skill needs both in the duration of the programme and in terms of the delivery of the off-the-job training. These new apprenticeship programmes vary in length from 2 to 4 years and have different methods of off-the-job training such as one day per week, as is the case with the chef apprenticeships, and on-line blended learning rather than the traditional block release of up to 22 weeks in an education setting, as is the case in the craft trades.  While there is no training allowance paid to apprentices undertaking one of our new apprenticeships, I am aware that some employers engaged in the system have raised this as an issue. However, any change in this regard, which has not yet been costed by the Department, would have to form part of the normal budgetary process and be considered in the broader context of competing demands and the overall availability of resources. <\/p><p>In addition to the apprenticeship programmes, there are a range of other programmes available in the hospitality area across further education and training and higher education settings. Similarly, there are employer-led training supported through Skillnet Ireland, such as the Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet, which was established in 2017, and the Taste 4 Success Skillnet to address skill needs in the sector. <\/p><p>As the new consortia led apprenticeships are ongoing and have not reached completion stage, we do not have a comprehensive database of completion figures.  This information will be recorded once submitted by the apprenticeship consortia. Details of apprentice population per apprenticeship programme as requested by the deputy are set out in the following tabular statement.  <\/p><p>Apprentice Population<table><tr><th>20 New

This marks the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date and is four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.<\/p><p>Irish exporters have been subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions when exporting to Mercosur. This Agreement will see a significant reduction, or elimination, of tariffs and barriers to trade which will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland, the EU and the Mercosur region. The EU-Mercosur Agreement should make exports from Ireland more attractive, and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.<\/p><p>As with every Free Trade Agreement, Ireland &ndash; like all Member States &ndash; has defensive as well as offensive interests. The Agreement with Mercosur presents sectoral opportunities for Ireland in areas such as software and services in telecoms, financial services, digital content and travel, engineering products and services, life sciences, food and beverages, and education services.<\/p><p>On the other hand, I was always keenly aware of the potential impact that this Agreement presents to the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. Ireland, along with a number of other Member States, asserted early on in the negotiations that these agricultural sensitivities (and beef in particular) must be fully considered in the negotiations.<\/p><p>In this regard, Ireland has continually highlighted the cumulative impact of agricultural market access in relation to all EU trade agreements. My Department has done this through engagement with the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels, as well as joining with other Member States in formally writing to the Commission outlining our concerns. In addition, our concerns have been raised at political level &ndash; including\u00a0myself and my officials raising the issues with counterparts, both at Trade Council deliberations and bilaterally with the EU Commission.<\/p><p>To that end, I wrote to the EU Trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m as recently as 31<sup>st<\/sup>May this year to restate my views, which I had previously articulated at European Trade Council meetings, as well as directly with the Trade Commissioner, regarding the current challenges facing the beef sector.<\/p><p>I had sought assurances from the Commission that the final offer on beef &ndash; an offensive demand from the Mercosur side &ndash; would ensure that:<\/p><p>- the tariff rate quota for beef was low.<\/p><p>- that phasing-in periods were designed to allow sufficient time for Irish and EU industry to adjust,<\/p><p>- the Commission continually monitor quota levels taking into account domestic market conditions,<\/p><p>- the composition of beef imports from the region would be limited in relation to fresh chilled beef, and<\/p><p>- robust checks would be established and monitored at points of import to the EU to ensure animal health and welfare standards have been maintained.<\/p><p>As I am sure you are aware, An Taoiseach also recently wrote to the Commission to highlight our particular sensitivities in these negotiations. An Taoiseach joined the leaders of France, Poland and Belgium on 17<sup>th<\/sup>June, in writing to Commission President Juncker expressing\u00a0our concerns on the inclusion of sensitive agricultural products in the negotiations, and stating that the current quotas for such products must not be increased.<\/p><p>It is disappointing that the agreement reached on beef access is more than we would have wished.\u00a0 Although the\u00a0quota of 99,000 tonnes is far less than the Mercosur countries were looking for. Also, the Agreement ensures an extended lead-in period before the full &ldquo;TRQ&rdquo; takes effect and that five-year period will only commence after the legal text of the Agreement is finalised and &ldquo;legally scrubbed&rdquo;, such that the full TRQ for beef will not take effect for some 7\/8 years from now. The Government&rsquo;s active campaign, together with some other Member States, to secure the viability of the Irish and EU beef sector, has been a key component in achieving these ameliorating elements to this particular TRQ for beef.<\/p><p>Despite our strenuous efforts, we obviously are disappointed in relation to beef. However, it&rsquo;s important also to recognise the positive aspects to the deal as I&rsquo;ve outlined earlier. In terms of Agriculture, it is important to note that the dairy sector will benefit from the removal of tariffs on cheese, milk powder and infant formula. There are also benefits for the drinks industry. <\/p><p>We now intend to carry out a comprehensive economic assessment of the deal to see what impact it&rsquo;ll have on the Irish economy and on jobs and that will inform future actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300083#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300083#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":356,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[28604\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300083#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the budget allocation for the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission in 2018 and 2019, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":357,"content":"<p>The Deputy should note that the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission form part of the overall Workplace Relations Programme area of my Department.

The Paris agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which will increase in ambition over time. The agreement means that the EU has a target of a 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

My Department plays a part in the enforcement of this legislation along with other Government departments and State Agencies such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the Health Service Executive. The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.<\/p>  <p>  Labelling of food is governed by the EU food legislation on the provision of Food Information to Consumers (Regulation (EU) No. 1169\/2011), which lays down strict rules on labelling of ingredients. Country of origin labelling is mandatory for certain meats and other products such as honey and wine. From 1 April 2020, it will be mandatory to indicate the country of origin of the primary ingredient (which makes up more than 50% of a food) if it is different from the country of origin of the product as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.<\/p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.<\/p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.

NORA is funded through a levy placed on the sale of most oil products. The current rate of the NORA levy is 2 cent per litre, having been set at this rate in 2009. Oil Companies are liable for payment of this levy when oil is placed on the market. However, I understand that the levy is passed on to consumers, both retail and commercial, when purchasing oil. The annual revenue from the NORA levy from 2007 to 2018 was as follows:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Annual Revenue<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>&euro;134,185,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>&euro;130,410,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;131,766,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;130,380,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;121,337,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;123,420,257<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;122,755,088<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;129,664,352<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>&euro;139,711,142<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>&euro;93,327,372<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>&euro;81,367,837<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>&euro;46,708,092<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>NORA levy monies are paid directly by the oil companies to NORA and not to the Exchequer. <\/p><p>Prior to 2009, the NORA levy was 1c per litre of product. This was not sufficient to meet NORA&rsquo;s expenses, including the purchase of oil stocks for use in an emergency, and a very considerable level of borrowing had built up. The levy was increased from 1 cent to 2 cent in 2009, primarily to manage and repay this debt, but also to build up stocks and secure additional storage, both within Ireland and abroad, to ensure Ireland held its 90-day obligation in physical stocks. <\/p><p>By April 2017 NORA had repaid all its outstanding debt obligations (&euro;444m in 2009) and now meets Ireland&rsquo;s oil stockholding obligations fully with physical stock. NORA was debt free throughout 2018. <\/p><p>The company&rsquo;s closing cash balance at 31st December 2018 was &euro;183.9m. This will be used for:<\/p><p>a) NORA&rsquo;s ongoing financing requirements and commitments;<\/p><p>b) the purchase of additional oil stocks associated with planned changes in storage contract arrangements, including stock to be purchased in 2020 and held at the ESB-owned oil storage site at Poolbeg, which has been refurbished by NORA.<\/p><p>Government approved the establishment of the Climate Action Fund (CAF), to be funded by the excess of receipts over costs from the NORA levy, to support projects that will help towards reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative proposals are currently being designed for the repurposing of the NORA levy to include meeting NORA&rsquo;s expenses, and to provide future financing to the CAF. As NORA levy funding is not paid to the Exchequer, the repurposing of a portion of this funding for the CAF will have no impact on the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sale of State Assets","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[28317\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the amount received from the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann including all subsidiaries in 1999; the costs incurred in the privatisation; the net proceeds from same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>While files from the then Department of Public Enterprise for the period in question will have been archived, details regarding this matter were presented at a meeting of then Public Accounts Committee on 7 December 2000 in respect of the 1999 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts 1999 for Vote 32.

In particular I see opportunities for industry and consumers to respond and make positive changes to how we use plastic and other packaging.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2019 has ten dedicated actions which focus on waste and the Circular Economy. Our focus will be on designing out waste, prioritising prevention of waste at every opportunity through eco-design, reuse and repair, market restriction and levies. <\/p><p>Ireland is working closely with other Member States in the European Union. We are working on the development of policy instruments which shall include:<\/p><p>- Regulatory changes;<\/p><p>- Market incentives;<\/p><p>- Promotion, labelling and the provision of information on sustainable practices;<\/p><p>- Developmental work with the sector to improve our capacity to deliver our goals.<\/p><p>Included in the regulatory changes will be the amended Waste Framework Directive which promotes the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) model and aims to make it more effective through minimum common requirements. <\/p><p>As part of the Climate Action Plan, we will identify opportunities to strengthen the regulatory and enforcement frameworks and structures for the waste collection and management system, to maximise the collection of clean, segregated materials for reuse and\/or recycling from all households and businesses, and to incentivise consumers to reduce, reuse and recycle. <\/p><p>The Climate Action Plan also commits to regulating and incentivising producers of waste, particularly packaging, to ensure the prevention of waste and the use of recycled materials in packaging product. The Plan states that the following steps will be necessary to deliver this action:<\/p><p>- Q3 2019: Pilot eco-modulation fees for packaging<\/p><p>- Q2 2020: New Packaging Waste Directive transposition<\/p><p>- Q1 2021: Implementation of full eco-modulated fees for packaging<\/p><p>A core opportunity for improving EPR measures is to develop economic incentives which favour circular products and business models. <\/p><p>Ahead of this, Repak members are taking steps to prevent and minimise the amount of packaging they require. With the assistance of the EPA, Repak&rsquo;s Prevent and Save initiative has worked with Irish business to reduce packaging and to promote packaging improvements across industry. Under the initiative, specialist packaging technologists look for ways to optimise the packaging used and to minimise any resulting packaging waste. Further information can be found on www.repak.ie\/preventandsave. However, it should also be noted that packaging is used by producers and retailers to protect and preserve goods and can help in preventing food and other product waste.<\/p><p>Under current Packaging Regulations, at least 60% of packaging waste must be recovered and 55% must be recycled. Repak is the approved producer responsibility compliance scheme for packaging in Ireland and it is tasked with meeting recovery and recycling targets established under the EU Packaging Directive. Repak recently confirmed that their members achieved an overall recycling rate of 68% for all materials and is ahead of the EU targets by 13%. Ireland&rsquo;s official statistics are compiled by the EPA and will be published shortly. It is anticipated they will show that Ireland has continued to meet and exceeded the overall packaging waste recovery rate and the recycling rate targets since they came into force. The task ahead of Ireland now is to meet the increased targets that will come into force under the CELP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM04425","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM04500"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[28516\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when he received the report from An Post on the closure of the mail centre in County Cork; the analysis undertaken in his Department regarding the decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[28517\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the report recommending the closure of the mail centre in County Cork will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[28519\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when he and his officials were informed regarding the closure of the mail centre in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[28520\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM04900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he was informed of the deployment options for the staff in relation to the closure of the mail centre in County Cork; the location of the options; the likely uptake of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[28521\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300086#WRM05000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he has been requested to meet a union (details supplied) in relation to the closure of the mail centre in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 to 301, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  An Post is a commercial State company with its own Board and has a mandate to deliver a viable postal delivery service and post office network.

The Deputy correctly notes that diesel technology has become progressively cleaner and greener over the past decade with the introduction of each improving Euro-class standard. Euro VI-class engines demonstrably emit fewer harmful air pollutants such as NO<sub>X<\/sub>and PMs. Notwithstanding that progress, a transition away from the use of fossil fuels towards alternative fuels in the heavy-duty sector will be required in the coming years to reduce our growing freight emissions. <\/p><p>My Department is working closely with that of Minister Bruton to encourage this transition, and an interdepartmental Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Taskforce was jointly convened to consider the range of options available to Government to accelerate the take-up of low-carbon technologies. While electric technology in the heavy-duty sector is not as well developed as in the light-duty sector, this is rapidly changing as the market matures; large vehicles such as electric trucks have been sold in other jurisdictions, indicating that electricity may become a more feasible option for the heavy-duty sector in the longer term. Of course, electric vehicles are not the only alternative fuel or technology available to reduce transport emissions; the <i>National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure in Ireland<\/i>, published by my Department in 2017, outlined a potential role for other fuels and technologies, including hydrogen, biofuels and natural gas\/biogas. Phase 2 of the LEV Taskforce which is considering these alternative fuels, amongst others, is ongoing. It is expected that the Taskforce will submit recommendations in this regard to Government as part of the 2020 Budget and Estimates Process. The role of incentives, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.<\/p><p>Over the coming years, further steps will be needed to help move towards decarbonisation of the freight sector and, more broadly, towards meeting our national emissions targets. The <i>Climate Action Plan<\/i>indicates potential pathways to achieving this. Action 83 of the Climate Action Plan indicates a commitment to consider the introduction of an emissions-based VRT and motor tax for light goods vehicles and heavy goods vehicles. The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for taxation, and consequently for implementation of this action, rests with the Department of Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300087#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300087#WRN00600"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[28349\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300087#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of research by the Road Safety Authority into e-scooters and other such vehicles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>The Road Safety Authority's review of current practice and safety implications of electric personal mobility devices was submitted to me in late June.<\/p>  <p>  The publication of the report is a matter for the Road Safety Authority, in consultation with my Department, once I have made a decision on the way forward in relation to electric scooters.

Following recent announcements in Budget 2019, the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance, blind pension and partial capacity benefit.  In 1997 the free travel pass was extended to all registered blind people regardless of whether they qualify for the Department's blind person's pension or any other Social Protection payment.

Primary responsibility for the programme rests with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys T.D.<\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland addresses challenges to participation in the labour force by developing and implementing a range of new initiatives aimed at easing barriers to entry into the workforce including investment in Early Learning and Care, providing tailored activation and training supports and generating attractive employment opportunities including intelligent working arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  As the nature of work and society changes, the way we organise work must also.  One of the ambitions in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 is to foster participation in the labour market through flexible working solutions.  Flexible working solutions, including part-time, remote working, compressed hours, home-working and job sharing, are understood to have the potential to improve labour market participation, particularly amongst women with young children, as well as those with caring responsibilities, older people, and people with disabilities.  Flexible working can also provide solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Flexible work can assist in the development of an inclusive society by offering options to the benefit of employers, workers and wider society.  We already have many companies in Ireland who offer remote working to their employees and this trend is expected to increase in the future.  For workers, flexible work solutions such as remote working can mean substantial savings in terms of rents and property costs while also reducing the need to commute, leading to a better work-life balance.  For businesses, intelligent working arrangements can support staff retention, a more motivated workforce with fewer sick days, and greater productivity, as well as the opportunity to draw workers from a larger pool of talent. <\/p>  <p>  Under Future Jobs Ireland 2019, the Department of Justice and Equality will develop guidance to support employers in offering more family-friendly working options and promoting the adoption of flexible and or remote working solutions and structures for parents.  In addition to this, the Department of Justice and Equality will commence a national consultation on the extension of flexible working options to all employees.  The findings of the research and the outcome of the national consultation may lead to the development of further, new deliverables for inclusion in the next stage, Future Jobs Ireland 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300089#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300089#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[28449\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070300089#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a disability allowance will be approved for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1248","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been awarded disability allowance with effect from 20 February 2019.

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental purposes.
