The Courts Service has no plans for this building at present and it is considered to be surplus to requirements.\u00a0 In these circumstances, I am informed that the Courts Service, in the first instance, offers the property to the relevant\u00a0local authority or the OPW for alternative public use. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that\u00a0the Courts Service would be willing to explore transferring ownership of the building to Wicklow County Council so that it can be made available for alternative public\/community use. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000063#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inquiry into the Death of Mr. Shane O'Farrell","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000063#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[41636\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000063#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will implement the decision of D&aacute;il Eireann of 14 February 2020 to establish a public enquiry into the circumstances of the death of a person (details supplied) and the subsequent actions of State agencies in this regard.","asker":"1451","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>I once again offer my condolences to the family of the late Shane O'Farrell.

It\u00a0also commits to ensuring that additional resources designated for the International Protection Office (IPO) are deployed in the most efficient and effective way possible to increase the output of quality decisions. I was pleased to secure an\u00a0additional &euro;1.75m in Budget 2021 for the efficient functioning of the international protection system, which will help us to further improve processing times for applications.<\/p>  <p>  The IPO is working hard to try to achieve a target of 9 months in the vast majority of cases.\u00a0 Efforts to improve processing times have been impacted by the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced the output of decisions\u00a0considerably.\u00a0At the end of Q3 2020, the median processing time for all cases processed at first instance in that quarter was 18.3 months and 14 months for prioritised cases.\u00a0 This is compared with the position at the end of Q1 2020 where the median processing times for all cases processed in that quarter\u00a0was 14.7 months and 9.8 months for prioritised cases.\u00a0 The number of cases on hand at the IPO is\u00a0just over 5,000 at present.<\/p>  <p>  For appeals against negative recommendations of the IPO, the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) had set as an objective this year that the average processing times, where an oral hearing is required, would be reduced to 90 working days. However, this has understandably been impacted due to the pandemic. All scheduled onsite hearings were postponed from 22\u00a0October 2020 due to Level 5 restrictions.\u00a0\u00a0They recommenced again on 1 December 2020, in line with the move to Level 3 restrictions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department is committed to achieving a reduction in processing times for both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months each respectively as far as possible in line with the recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group. An\u00a0end to end process review is currently underway which will help guide on the approach and resource requirements. \u00a0I\u00a0also secured additional funding in Budget 2021 to support our ICT strategy, a significant portion of which will be used for immigration and international protection purposes. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regarding citizenship applications, in general, the current target is\u00a0that it should take\u00a0around 12 months for a standard\u00a0application for a certificate of naturalisation to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.\u00a0 In some instances, completing the necessary checks, including security checks\u00a0can take a considerable period of time with the\u00a0result in\u00a0some applications taking longer than the average timescale. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of October there were 23,187 applications being processed at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received by the Citizenship Division to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. <\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department is working on various solutions to process the existing caseload on hand, including the enhanced website which provides prospective applicants with greater information than before, the\u00a0roll-out earlier this year of the e-payments facility, along with a\u00a0range of other ICT solutions which are being progressed.

While many reforms have been introduced, there are still a number of long standing issues which need more work to be resolved and I understand this is where the focus must be.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, one area highlighted by the Committee for immediate attention is how the complex needs of people with mental health difficulties who come into contact with the criminal justice system are provided for. The whole area of how criminal justice and public health, especially mental health, intersect and how to best provide the most appropriate service is a priority for the me as Minister for Justice and for Minister Donnelly. <\/p><p>It's priority status is acknowledged in the Programme for Government in that it commits to establishing a high-level cross-departmental \/ cross-agency taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release. <\/p><p>In order the progress this matter, I met with my colleague the Minister for Health in September to lay the foundations for advancing work on this commitment without delay because I believe that a properly constituted Task Force with the support of both Departments can drive much needed transformation in this area.<\/p><p>It is widely acknowledged that every person with mental health difficulties coming in contact with the system should have access to comprehensive mental health support, the Deputy may appreciate that delivering on this requires considerable planning for, and implementation of, an appropriate model of care for this vulnerable group. <\/p><p>This will be a complex body of work with a number of cross-cutting issues that cannot be addressed in isolation. <\/p><p>I am pleased to say that collaboration with the Department of Health on the development of Terms of Reference and structure for the establishment of the Task Force is now at an advanced stage. The terms of reference have been agreed in principle between the two Departments. Work is now underway to identify a chair and put in place other administrative details.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a range of other matters have also been raised by the Committee in the report and I am pleased to say that a significant amount of work is underway to address the concerns raised.  A review of the use of Safety Observation Cells, has already commenced as has a review of the relevant Prison Rules taking account of the most recently published Council of Europe - European Prison Rules. I understand that appropriate Standard Operating Procedures and training in relation to the use of both Safety Observation and Close Supervision Cells will also be implemented. <\/p><p>In terms of the comments by the Committee regarding restricted regimes, I can confirm that the IPS are undertaking a series of measures to address this issue. I understand that the IPS will review the recording process for out of cell time for prisoners on restricted regimes and introduce a standardised recording for all prisoners on restricted regimes<\/p><p>It is a requirement of the IPS Policy on the Elimination of Solitary Confinement thatGovernors ensure adequate and correct record-keeping. Since the CPT visit, the need for accuraterecording of regime levels has been re-enforced to Governors at both the Solitary Confinement Group (chaired by the DG) and also at the IPS Strategy and Policy Group meeting, which all Governors and Operational Governors attend. Staff have been issued with a reminder of the importance of accurate record keeping. A new standardised reporting book for prisoners on restricted regimes is being introduced to all locations. To enhance the recording of out of cell time, the IPS will review the recording process for out of cell time for prisoners on restricted regimes across the system and introduce a standardised recording of all prisoners on Restricted Regime. Consideration will also be given to incorporating this process into the Prison Information Management System (PIMS). <\/p><p>I think that it is important to note that the numbers on a restricted regime reflect the challenge faced by the Prison Service to provide safe custody for all those in their care. The DG of the IPS chairs a high-level group to look at measures, which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regimes. The objective of this group is to ensure that all prisoners receive a minimum standard out of cell time, to engage in exercise or activity consistent with IPS on the Elimination of Solitary Confinement. <\/p><p>Finally, I would like to reassure the Deputy that this Government and the IPS are fully committed to implementing the longer-term changes required to make our penal system safe, effective and responsive to the needs of all prisoners, especially vulnerable persons. While there is unlikely to be quick fix solutions to some of the issues highlighted by the CPT, we will continue to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system. <\/p><p>Further details on the report can be found on the website of the Committee at <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000063#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000063#WRB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[42425\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000063#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to amend section 252 of the Children Act 2001 in view of a recent Court of Appeals judgement.","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>I would like to thank to Deputy for raising this issue that has arisen following\u00a0the recent judgment in the case DPP v.

While I believe that there is much we can be proud of, I fully accept that there are still a number of long standing issues which need more work to be resolved and I understand this is where the focus must be.<\/p>  <p>  One area highlighted by the Committee for immediate attention is how the complex needs of people with mental health difficulties who come into contact with the criminal justice system are provided for. The whole area of how criminal justice and public health, especially mental health, intersect and how to best provide the most appropriate service is a priority for the me as Minister for Justice and for Minister Donnelly. <\/p>  <p>  It's priority status is acknowledged in the Programme for Government in that it commits to establishing a high-level cross-departmental \/ cross-agency taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release. <\/p>  <p>  In order the progress this matter, I met with my colleague the Minister for Health in September to lay the foundations for advancing work on this commitment without delay because I believe that a properly constituted Task Force with the support of both Departments can drive much needed transformation in this area.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that every person with mental health difficulties coming in contact with the system should have access to comprehensive mental health support, the Deputy may appreciate that delivering on this requires considerable planning for, and implementation of, an appropriate model of care for this vulnerable group. <\/p>  <p>  This will be a complex body of work with a number of cross-cutting issues that cannot be addressed in isolation. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that collaboration with the Department of Health on the development of Terms of Reference and structure for the establishment of the Task Force is now at an advanced stage. The terms of reference have been agreed in principle between the two Departments. Work is now underway to identify a chair and put in place other administrative details.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a range of other matters have also been raised by the Committee in the report and I am pleased to say that a significant amount of work is underway to address the concerns raised.  <\/p>  <p>  The IPS will be implementing a new prisoner complaints system before the end of 2020 which, when bedded down, will include an oversight role for the Ombudsman and a detailed information and awareness campaign for prisoners on the new system will also be rolled out across the prison estate.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that work has now been completed on a new Block F in Cloverhill prison which is intended to be used to accommodate persons detained for immigration purposes and ensure they can be housed separately from other remand prisoners. While this will address the situation in the immediate term, work is also proceeding on the consideration of a longer-term sustainable and compliant solution.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the use of Close Supervision Cells and Safety Observation Cells, the IPS has already commenced, in conjunction with officials working on the development of penal policy in my Department, a review of the Prison Rules taking account of the most recently published Council of Europe - European Prison Rules.  It is intended that the operation, management and governance of these cells will be considered as part of this review and a clear distinction between the operation of Close Supervision Cells and Safety Observation Cells will be made. I understand that appropriate Standard Operating Procedures and training in relation to the use of both will also be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of overcrowding, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department is undertaking a number of actions regarding the consideration of the greater use of alternatives to imprisonment. In addition, the Director General of the IPS is committed to ensuring that any person committed to custody is, in so far as possible, provided with a permanent bed in a prison cell. To achieve this, and ensure the effective management of the increasing prisoner population, the Director General has developed a Prison Population Management Plan in 2019 aimed at maximising capacity within the estate, increasing the use of open centres and the use of back door strategies including structured temporary release.<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service has also conducted a full cell audit across the Prisons Estate, which included an examination of the capacity of cellular accommodation in accordance with minimum standards for multiple occupancy. As a result, approximately 135 additional beds were introduced which includes 60 in Wheatfield, 30 in the Midlands, and 40 in the D&oacute;chas Centre.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Capital Strategy 2016-2021 outlines plans for the complete replacement of the outdated accommodation in Limerick and Portlaoise prisons as well as improvements across a number of other prisons. On completion of the Limerick and Portlaoise projects, &ldquo;slopping out&rdquo; will be completely eliminated across the prisons estate. Prior to the Budget the IPS had a capital allocation for 2021 of &euro;21 million. The allocation of an additional  &euro;15 million brings the total allocation for this project in 2021 to &euro;36 million. This will be sufficient to complete the Limerick Prison redevelopment project. <\/p>  <p>  The CPT report also notes that a small number of prison staff are inclined to use excessive force. I am advised by the Director General that the IPS is committed to ensuring that the use of force by staff is restricted to situations or circumstances where is it deemed reasonable and necessary and that a number of safeguards are in place to ensure staff operate within the necessary procedures and rules.  I understand that staff regularly receive updated training on de-escalation and the use of physical force as part of their annual Continuous Professional Development training. <\/p>  <p>  While it is worth noting that the CPT report states that an accused person&rsquo;s right of access to a lawyer  &ldquo;&hellip;continues to operate in a satisfactory manner as from the very outset of custody.&rdquo;,  it is also noted that the Committee recommends this right is put on a statutory basis. My Department is preparing additional legislative safeguards for the provision of legal representation in new legislation on police powers of search, arrest and detention. It is intended that this new Bill will provide for the right to have a legal representative present during questioning.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that we have committed in the programme for Government to ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT)  before the end of 2021. In that regard, a single National Preventative Mechanism for the Justice Sector will be introduced to include Garda stations, courts, prisons, places of transport and transit between Garda stations, prisons and courts.  To this end, the General Scheme of the Places of Detention Bill is being drafted with a view to securing Government approval in early 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to reassure the Deputy that this Government and the IPS are fully committed to implementing the longer-term changes required to make our penal system safe, effective and responsive to the needs of all prisoners, especially vulnerable persons. While there is unlikely to be quick fix solutions to some of the issues highlighted by the CPT, we will continue to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000064#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000064#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[42160\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000064#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her response to the increase in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that addressing all forms of domestic abuse and sexual violence is a key priority for me and my Department.

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  During the early stages of the pandemic, it was decided to issue only positive recommendations in respect of International Protection applicants. The aim of this approach was to ensure applicants with negative recommendations were not disadvantaged by the time limits set out in the legislation within which they must make an appeal or request a review of a refusal of permission to remain. Once substantive processing and appeal hearings recommenced in more recent months, so too did the issuing of negative decisions.

Prisoners are a recognised vulnerable group for a number of reasons including their general levels of health, age and addictions issues and an outbreak of Covid-19 in a prison could have potentially devastating consequences. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made by the\u00a0IPS\u00a0to continue physical visits during this pandemic however, following Government and NPHET advice it was necessary to suspend physical visits to prisons, firstly in March and more recently in October.\u00a0 The Service is acutely aware of the need for prisoners to maintain contact with their families and in that regard a new video visit system was introduced which has allowed families to continue to support those in custody during this time. <\/p>  <p>  All prisoners are entitled to one 20 minute video visit per week to nominated family and friends. The feedback from prisoners has been very positive as the visit allows people to connect with their families in their homes. The feedback from families has also been positive as it allows families to continue to support prisoners without having to make long journeys to prison to avail of a visit. The\u00a0IPS introduced a support line to provide information to families on how to connect to the video visit and assist with any connection difficulties. The\u00a0Prison Service fully appreciate how important contact with family and friends are to people in custody. When physical visits recommence, the Service will also retain the option of video calls for prisoners. <\/p>  <p>  A number of useful guides and videos have also been developed, in a number of languages, and these are available on the Prison Service website. <\/p>  <p>  It was the case that some family members were visiting prisoners in order to lodge money to the prisoner&rsquo;s account for their use in the prison tuck shop however, the\u00a0IPS has introduced a number of new methods for the electronic transfer of money making it much easier for families. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am advised that\u00a0in addition to video visits, \u00a0additional phone calls have been also been facilitated for prisoners to allow them to keep in contact with loved ones. In this regard the Prison Service is granting an additional daily phone call to all those in custody during the Christmas period. <\/p>  <p>  While these are important initiatives I recognise that physical visits are hugely important to prisoners and their families and I am pleased to advise that the\u00a0IPS has announced that arrangements have been made to allow all those in custody to book a physical family visit between the 16th December and the 6th of January. <\/p>  <p>  Each prisoner will be entitled to one physical visit during the period, which will be 15 minutes in duration. In order to ensure that visits are conducted as safely as possible, visits will be limited to two people of which one may be a child.\u00a0 The risk posed by Covid-19 still remains therefore in order to prevent the potential spread of infection all visits will be behind clear screens and visitors and prisoners will be required to wear a face mask at all times.\u00a0No physical contact between prisoners and family members will be permitted.<\/p>  <p>  The normal security screening procedures will be in place however, all visitors will also be subject to the Covid-19 screening procedure including having their temperature taken. Visitors are asked not to attend the prison if they have any Covid-19 symptoms, have been in contact with a person who has gone for testing for the virus or is a confirmed case or have been abroad in the proceeding 14 days. <\/p>  <p>  The IPS have asked that\u00a0 all packages and mail reaches the prison no later than\u00a0December 10th 2020\u00a0to ensure that it reaches loved ones before Christmas. Due to Covid-19 infection control restrictions all mail must be quarantined for a period before being delivered to the person who is to receive it.

The audit will be undertaken by an external consultant with meaningful involvement from relevant NGOs and service providers, as well as input from Departments and agencies. <\/p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the audit have been finalised, and a procurement process to engage an independent\u00a0person to undertake the audit has commenced with details available on my Department's website (www.justice.ie).

My Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, which is a whole-of-Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters fully. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.\u00a0 The Monitoring Committee and the NGOs represented on it\u00a0are key partners for my Department in our work to tackle DSGBV and will be a primary focus of our consultations in the audit process. I can confirm for the Deputy that the organisation referred to is a member of the Monitoring Committee. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, a review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As part of\u00a0our\u00a0national response to domestic abuse,\u00a0in\u00a02020, my Department committed almost &euro;1.9 million to support services for victims of\u00a0crime, including victims of sexual and gender based violence.\u00a0 These services provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services.\u00a0I have secured &euro;4.104 million under Budget 2021 to continue supporting victims of crime.\u00a0 I have also secured just\u00a0over &euro;3 million for\u00a0raising awareness of\u00a0domestic, sexual and gender based violence.\u00a0 These figures reflect the\u00a0additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 to support the implementation of the O'Malley review which will support vulnerable victims, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. <\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo; will be\u00a0implemented as a priority and it includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey throughout the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. Engagement on development of training programmes for serving Garda&iacute;, the legal professions and members of the judiciary who are participating in sexual offences investigations and trials has already started, and I expect this training will be further rolled out in 2021.<\/p>  <p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete nationwide with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. The completion of the rollout of DPSUs means that specially trained officers are available nationwide who will be responsible for engagement with, and interviewing of, vulnerable victims.\u00a0 This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of\u00a0specialist professional and expert assistance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000065#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":195,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 77 to 88, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000065#WRD00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000065#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[40647\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000065#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the disability day services that have not reopened since Covid-19; when it is planned to open services fully; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>All day service locations with the exception of those being utilised as COVID-19 Isolation or testing centres have reopened since August.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 7 day service locations nationally that are being used for COVID-19 isolation or testing centres: one in CHO1; two in CHO2; one in CHO3 and three in CHO9. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Service users that usually received their supports from these locations are now either receiving supports at another location or receiving outreach or home-based supports.\u00a0 A further location will resume as a day service location in the coming weeks as an alternative COVID-19 test facility has been procured. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Day services re-opened at 39% capacity throughout August and early September.

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility.

These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness.

In particular, the telehealth access to GP services for COVID-19 symptoms, the integration of services across acute and community, the focus on managing as much care as possible in the community and the rapid deployment of e-health solutions illustrate what is possible and the extent to which the pandemic response has helped to demonstrate in practice the Sl&aacute;intecare vision. <\/p><p>Key programmes that have progressed during 2020 include commencing the implementation of improving <b>population health-based planning<\/b>and developing <b>new models of care<\/b>to deliver <b>more effective and integrated care,<\/b>especially in relation to:<\/p><p>- Innovative integration programmes that support people to live independently at home, promote self-empowerment, and have a focus on preventing illness, across 122 sites all around the country;<\/p><p>- 96 Sl&aacute;intecare Community Healthcare Networks based on populations of 50,000 people, and Specialist Hubs for Older People;<\/p><p>- the agreement with General Practice to deliver a national Chronic Disease Management (CDM)Programme; and<\/p><p>- Patient Prescriptions e-Scripts between GPs and Pharmacies through the secure Healthmail system.

Keeping people well at home or near home, out of hospital, living independent lives, by implementing agreed end to end care pathways between GPs, Community and Hospital services, through Community Healthcare Networks and Specialist Hubs and a variety of related projects.\u00a0 Healthy Ireland is a key enabler of this programme.<\/p><p>2.

Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals and the HSE was agreed at the end of March. In the interests of transparency, a copy of the Heads of Terms to the Agreement, which sets out the broad terms of the arrangement, was laid before the Oireachtas last April. It\u00a0is not proposed to publish the details of arrangements with individual hospitals as\u00a0that information is commercially sensitive and as such to publish it would be a breach of the Heads of Terms to the Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0The agreement provided that\u00a0the HSE would secure 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June. The final costs of the arrangement are still subject to verification. However, it is estimated that the costs arising from the agreement will be in the region of &euro;305 million euros.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the agreement, payment to the private hospitals\u00a0was on a cost only Open Book model whereby the hospitals\u00a0were reimbursed only for the operating costs properly incurred during the period. The costs covered\u00a0were limited to normal costs of operating the hospital. The hospitals will only receive their actual operating costs when these have been verified. The final cost will be verified by\u00a0independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals and there is an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement. At the time of the agreement it was determined that the cost only open book model was the most effective way of ensuring the arrangement was value for money for the State.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following termination of the private hospital agreement in June, the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree with the private hospitals a new arrangement which\u00a0would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity to cover three areas:<\/p>  <p>  - To secure a safety net arrangement against the potential of a further surge of Covid-19 cases;<\/p>  <p>  - Capacity arising from the need to run the public hospitals in a Covid-19 environment; and<\/p>  <p>  - To secure elective activity to assist with waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions are still ongoing between the HSE and private hospitals with regard to a safety net arrangement in the event of another surge in Covid-19 cases. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE is\u00a0in the final stage of a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostics from private providers which is required to address some of the anticipated shortfall over the next two years.\u00a0A panel will be put in place, following which each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need. In the meantime, the Department has approved a\u00a0HSE temporary arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of broader hospital capacity the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds from the baseline at the start of 2020.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020\/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress.<\/p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000066#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[41642\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000066#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the sharing of passenger data between Northern Ireland and here and for those arriving onto the island of Ireland for the purpose of contact tracing and enforcement of restricted movement requirements; if he has agreed a process in relation to the matter with his counterpart in the Stormont Executive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>In October, the Irish Government adopted the EU &ldquo;traffic lights&rdquo; approach to intra EU travel and has taken decisions on what public health measures will apply to international arrivals.

Students train under supervision and\u00a0 alongside qualified staff who have undertaken additional preceptorship training to support them in the clinical area. Students do not have responsibility for patient case loads while on supernumerary placements. While students may participate in the delivery of care, the supernumerary status\u00a0 ensures supported learning, essential\u00a0 for students in gaining the range of skills and experience needed for qualification. \u00a0<\/p><p>Financial supports for non-intern student nurses and midwives are governed by Circular 9\/2004, that provides:<\/p><p>- an accommodation allowance up to &euro;50.79 per week to be paid where it is necessary for a student to obtain accommodation away from their normal place of residence;<\/p><p>- a refund of travel expenses.<\/p><p>Both are paid as refunds on production of receipts.\u00a0<\/p><p>Concerning 4<sup>th<\/sup>year nursing and midwifery students, the HSE\u00a0continues to fund the internship employment of these students who are on rostered work placements.

This rate of pay is determined by\u00a0HSE circular 005\/2016 and is updated in accordance with the consolidated pay scales issued on 01<sup>st<\/sup>October, 2020 by my Department.

This is a specific exemption for nurses and midwives for which I have secured Government approval;<\/p><p>- Enhanced Illness benefit for those students who work part time but have fallen ill with COVID-19;<\/p><p>- Other welfare schemes to assist with financial hardship due to illness, subject to qualifying criteria (Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Urgent Needs Payment);<\/p><p>- Access for eligible students\u00a0to the National Access Plan (Contingency Fund) and Student Assistance Fund.<\/p><p>- &euro;250 top-up for those in receipt of the SUSI grant or &euro;250 contribution to fees\u00a0for eligible students.<\/p><p>A review of student allowances has been completed by my Department and after consideration of the findings, I have instructed that the current travel and accommodation allowance rates be subject to a focused re-examination, in the form of a time limited process which shall be subject to an independent appraisal and concluded no later than 5<sup>th<\/sup>January 2021.

One of those objectives was for Ireland to reach a consumption rate of 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita by 2020. The remaining objectives were to delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people, to reduce the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol, and to regulate the supply and price of alcohol in order to minimise the possibility and incidence of alcohol related harm. The Bill was not enacted until October 2018 therefore the time between enactment and the 2020 objective of reducing consumption to 9.1 litres per capita was shorter than was originally anticipated.<\/p><p>In 2019 alcohol consumption per capita in Ireland was 10.86 litres. This has fallen from the high rate of 14.3 litres per capita in 2001 but levels have remained at approximately 11 litres since 2015 with consumption at 11 litres in 2017, 11.01 litres in 2018 and 10.86 litres in 2019. \u00a0<\/p><p>The Public Health (Alcohol) Act is designed to achieve its objectives through addressing alcohol pricing, labelling, advertising and display. \u00a0<\/p><p>In November 2019, the following substantive provisions on the Act became law:<\/p><p>- a prohibition on alcohol advertising\u00a0in or on public service vehicles, at public transport stops or stations and within 200 m of a school, early years centre or a local authority playground.<\/p><p>- a prohibition on alcohol advertising in a cinema except around films with an 18 classification or in licensed premises within a cinema.<\/p><p>- a prohibition on children&rsquo;s clothing that promotes alcohol.<\/p><p>These measures aim to create an environment free from alcohol advertising in areas frequented by children and will ensure that our children can grow up in circumstances where they are not regularly exposed to alcohol advertising.\u00a0<\/p><p>On 12 November this year,\u00a0section 22 of the Act, which provides for the separation and visibility of the alcohol products in mixed retail outlets became operational. This recently applicable law means that mixed retail outlets such as supermarkets must confine alcohol products to either:<\/p><p>- an area separated by a 1.2 metre high barrier, or<\/p><p>- units in which alcohol products are not visible up to 1.5 metres height, or<\/p><p>- up to three units that can be a maximum of 1 metre wide by 2.2 metres high.<\/p><p>In addition, alcohol products can be contained but not be visible in a unit behind the counter. \u00a0<\/p><p>The separation of alcohol products from other grocery products in retail outlets is designed to reduce the likelihood that alcohol products will be on display near grocery products, thereby discouraging their purchase as part of everyday household grocery shopping. In addition, alcohol products will be less visible to children. \u00a0<\/p><p>From 11 January next year, the\u00a0Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 (Sale and Supply of Alcohol Products) Regulations\u00a0will come into force. The purpose of the Regulations is to address the inclusion of alcohol products in price promotion schemes. The Regulations\u00a0are designed to prohibit:<\/p><p>- the use of bonus or loyalty card points in relation to alcohol products<\/p><p>- the sale of alcohol products  at a reduced price when sold with another product or service, and <\/p><p>- the sale of alcohol productsat a reduced price for a period of 3 days or less.\u00a0<\/p><p>Finally, in November next year the following provisions will become law:<\/p><p>- A prohibition on alcohol advertising on a sports area during a sporting event, at events aimed at children or at events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children.<\/p><p>- Alcohol sponsorship of events aimed at children, events at which the majority of participants or competitors are children and events involving driving or racing motor vehicles is prohibited.<\/p><p>Progression of work relating to the commencement of the remaining provisions of the Act, including the drafting of regulations relating to the labelling and advertising of alcohol products, was interrupted in March due to the prioritisation of legislation and other work related to the pandemic. \u00a0As set out in the 2013 Government Decision which approved the minimum unit pricing of alcohol products, this measure will be introduced when a similar measure is introduced in Northern Ireland so as to allay concerns that its introduction in one jurisdiction only would impact cross-border trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000068#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000068#WRG02100"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[42305\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000068#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of older persons waiting for home support hours at the end of November 2020 in the north Tipperary east Limerick LHO area and in the south Tipperary LHO area;

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November\u00a0last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic.The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.It will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises\u00a0as works\u00a0commence. I am aware\u00a0that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network\u00a0and I am advised that\u00a0NBI is working\u00a0to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.<\/p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of\u00a03 December 2020, over 139,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company.\u00a0Surveys have been completed in the following areas across\u00a0Co Kildare, Killashee, Oughterard, Naas Rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas Urban, Newtown and Donaghcumper. The next step is for NBI to develop network designs to deliver the new fibre to the home network to these premises, followed by pre build and build works. I am advised that NBI intend to have completed surveys at this location\u00a0in early\u00a02021 and the\u00a0indicative target commencement of network build at this location will be available following that work.The first fibre to the home connections are expected shortly in Carrigaline\u00a0and \u00a0will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from\u00a0early 2021\u00a0retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.<\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.\u00a0As of 3 December, 217 sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. 59 publicly accessible BCPs across the country are now live. BCPs locations due for installation in Kildare include Backgate Lodge, Kilkee Demesne, Castledermot and Crookstown Further Education and Training Centre.\u00a0 Bigstone Community Hall is now fully connected with public WiFi and Lullymore Heritage Park is installed and waiting connectivity.\u00a0 Further details can be found at .\u00a0 <\/p><p>Rathmore National School and St Davids National School in Co Kildare will be connected for educational access as part of this initiative by the end of the year.

Since the publication of\u00a0the report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The IMDO recently reviewed the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 GB Landbridge Study and in particular the issue of direct maritime connectivity and capacity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.\u00a0 The IMDO analysis shows that there is\u00a0sufficient capacity on existing direct services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for all of the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.\u00a0 The shipping industry serving Ireland have shown that they are resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019. \u00a0We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to Continental Europe, they will respond.\u00a0\u00a0Additional shipping links were added on direct routes to Continental Europe even during the Covid-19 pandemic in Summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity announced to take place starting from January 2021, including new RoRo (roll on roll off) services from Ireland to Zeebrugge, Santander and\u00a0Portugal by CLdN.\u00a0New LoLo (lift on lift-off) and Bulk services have also been added in the period.\u00a0Increased frequency by Irish Ferries and Stena Line\u00a0on the Ireland\/Cherbourg routes from 1 January 2020 will mean that between them there will be a daily service available from Ireland to France. Brittany Ferries have also increased their number of sailings from next year. <\/p>  <p>Indeed, a new six-day per week RoRo service from Rosslare to Dunkirk\u00a0was announced on 27 November to commence in\u00a0  January 2020. \u00a0There will be three new vessels on the route with a journey time of\u00a024 hours from\u00a0Rosslare to Dunkerque, carrying around\u00a0120\u00a0trucks \/ trailers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Such announcements reinforce the IMDO report findings about the willingness and ability of the shipping sector\u00a0to adjust and respond to market demand. <\/p>  <p>  The Government considers that direct State intervention to establish State shipping links in the context of Brexit would be likely to undermine a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place.\u00a0Such an intervention would\u00a0be almost certain to result in legal challenges from shipping providers already providing services to Continental Europe, would result in breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid.\u00a0 It could also create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9th September 2020, businesses are being asked to consider moving,\u00a0in advance of the end of the transition period, to direct route options for the movement of goods from Ireland to the Continent, to avoid potential delays and the new procedures that will be introduced associated with using the UK landbridge. \u00a0Shipping companies\u00a0should also continue to assess expected future demand requirements and remain ready to respond to increased capacity demands, and all the indications are that this is happening\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A communications campaign is currently underway, \"ACT now and Prepare to switch\", which encourages importers and exporters to focus on the direct route option now. This campaign\u00a0encourages stakeholders to Assess their current routes to market, Communicate their future needs clearly to shipping companies, and\u00a0Trial alternative services so that disruption to the GB Landbridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor and keep under review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports and will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders, including\u00a0importers, exporters and freight and logistics stakeholders,\u00a0as we\u00a0all\u00a0prepare for the post Brexit scenario arising from January 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[42646\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ06000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a driver test date in Donegal town; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>The scheduling of driving tests is the responsibility of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and I have no power to intervene\u00a0in individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  The \u00a0Deputy should be aware that the Road Safety Authority cannot schedule applicants for a driving test until the Authority has received the confirmation from the candidate's ADI Instructor that they have the completed 12 Essential Driver Training\u00a0(EDT) sessions.\u00a0 Under Level 5 of the COVID plan, in the interest of public health, driving tests were restricted only to essential workers, while driving lessons were limited to those with a test booking.\u00a0 However, following the move to Level 3, that is no longer the case and lessons may now be obtained from an authorised driving instructor.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0If the person has completed their 12 EDT\u00a0sessions, they may wish to request an urgent test.

To fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking established in Ireland (or in any other EU Member State) must have a nominated Transport Manager who resides in the EU to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities. The Transport Manager must hold a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) in either Road Haulage or Road Passenger Transport, depending on the nature of the operator's business. This certificate must be issued by an EU Member State and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination.  <\/p><p>As highlighted by the European Commission in their notice to stakeholders in 2018 and more recently in July of this year, after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December any Transport Manager CPC issued by an authority of the United Kingdom or a body authorised by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid to work for an EU operator.  As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, my Department carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC who are currently nominated as Transport Manager for Irish road transport operators.  The Department wrote to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators in October 2019 to highlight the position as outlined by the European Commission and communicated with them again last month in this regard. <\/p><p>The matter of UK-issued Transport Manager CPCs held by Transport Managers working for Irish operators is among the issues that have been raised by my Department in ongoing engagement with the European Commission in the context of Brexit. The matter similarly impacts, for example, on people living in the EU and working for other EU-based operators but holding a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC. The Commission recently provided clarification that a corresponding Irish Transport Management CPC may be issued to UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators, before the end of the Brexit transition period. This means that these Transport Managers will not now be required to undertake an Irish examination in order to continue to work as Transport Manager for an Irish or other EU operator.  <\/p><p>In view of this clarification, my Department has established arrangements with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) for the application process to obtain a corresponding Irish Transport Management CPC.  CILT is the body with responsibility for issuing Transport Management CPCs in Ireland on behalf of my Department.  A further communication has now been issued by my Department to affected Transport Managers to outline how to contact CILT in order to obtain an Irish Transport Manager CPC.<\/p><p>It is important to note that application must be made to CILT by 31 December 2020, as after that date it will <i>not<\/i>be possible to obtain an Irish Transport Management CPC on the basis of holding a UK certificate. My Department has emphasised this point to affected Transport Managers and has urged them to contact CILT as soon as possible.<\/p><p>No fee will apply in this case for obtaining an Irish Transport Management CPC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ06700"},{"type":"question","counter":584,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[42711\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ06800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if professional fees are paid by his Department on behalf of employees; if so, the total number involved; and the amount of each fee.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>The Department of Transport pays\u00a0professional fees relevant to the role of\u00a0employees.

The service resumed, on a gradual basis, in mid-July.\u00a0   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since resuming operations, there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog.\u00a0 Unfortunately, due to social distancing and other public health and hygiene requirements, service capacity has had to be considerably reduced. This means that customers experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended.\u00a0   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Level 5 restrictions which took effect for six weeks from 22 October 2020 to the 01 December, meant that driving tests were only available to those involved in essential services, including essential retail work. While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety must remain of paramount importance.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is currently examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints and is working in close consultation with my Department on this matter. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently approved the retention by the RSA of 18 temporary driver testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November, and the RSA has also rehired a further 18 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May. This will help to increase testing capacity. However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased within current health constraints. Due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete. As a result, the number of tests a tester can safely conduct per day was reduced from eight to five when the service reopened.\u00a0 Following experience of managing the tests under Covid restrictions, this was increased to six in mid-September. This may be raised to 7, depending on health assurance, but not until January 2021 at the earliest.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is around ten weeks.\u00a0 It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.\u00a0 It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Infrastructure Provision","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ07300"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[42727\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000070#WRJ07400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if local authorities can apply for funding out of the fund announced on 4 December 2020 of &euro;50 million for investment in walking and cycling projects for areas outside of towns and villages in which an estimated 30% of the population live (details supplied);

or by agreeing primary and secondary taxing rights, providing that the country with secondary taxing rights should offer relief against the tax payable in that country for the tax suffered in the other country with primary taxing rights.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If there is a charge to income tax in Ireland arising from the operation of Section 127B and a charge to tax on the same income in another jurisdiction then the exact arrangement in relation to the taxation of flight crew depends on the wording of the relevant DTA.\u00a0 For example, Article 14(3) of the Ireland-Netherlands DTA grants sole taxing rights to the country in which the employee is resident in respect of remuneration from an employment exercised aboard an aircraft in international traffic.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is therefore important to note that the operation of the relevant DTA does not undermine or invalidate the domestic charge to tax, and that, whilst DTAs provide relief from double taxation, they cannot themselves form the basis for a charge to tax, nor do they purport to do so.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The OECD MTC is one of a number of model treaties which States may choose to adopt (whether in whole or in part) in concluding and\/or amending their DTAs.\u00a0 The model treaties are non-binding instruments which aim to provide guidance to countries in designing and negotiating double tax treaties, as well as in applying and interpreting them. \u00a0The OECD MTC, as interpreted by the Commentaries thereon, constitute guidance for OECD contracting states when concluding or revising bilateral DTAs and there is no legal obligation, as a matter of international, EU or domestic law, to incorporate the OECD MTC into existing DTAs or those yet to be negotiated, or domestic tax legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s DTAs reflect, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the tax policies of each of the two contracting states, the OECD MTC in the version published when those DTAs were concluded.\u00a0 \u00a0In the case of the DTAs concluded by Ireland with other EU Member States, such DTAs were concluded before November 2017, i.e at a date when the following version of Article 15(3) of the OECD MTC applied:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic &hellip; may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Model treaties may be amended from time to time, and when the OECD MTC is amended this has no impact on Ireland&rsquo;s existing DTAs unless and until the relevant DTA is amended or replaced through subsequent bilateral negotiations, or its operation is modified through the ratification of a multilateral instrument, such as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In any event, no conflict arises between existing DTAs and the 2017 update to the OECD MTC, as the Commentaries therein confirm that, in considering which aspects of that MTC to draw on when negotiating and concluding a DTA, Contracting States may validly prefer to tax the remuneration of international aircrew in the State of the enterprise operating the aircraft, notwithstanding the amendment to Article 15.3 by the 2017 OECD MTC.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a fully committed OECD member and the approach adopted by Ireland in concluding or revising DTAs has been, and continues to be, fully consistent with that commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000071#WRK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000071#WRK04500"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[42781\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000071#WRK04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the average rental income tax paid by landlord per property;

with Covid-19\u00a0is a risk management strategy for the period up to June 2021. It is designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures Government might introduce to stop escalation of the transmission of the disease. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the plan for Living with Covid-19 the Government has in recent months\u00a0framed restrictions to account for periods where there is low incidence\u00a0of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission through to situations where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. Throughout\u00a0this period\u00a0the Government has made an exemption for weddings in view of the importance of these occasions to couples and the level of planning that is involved for couples and their families. <\/p>  <p>  On 27 November the Government agreed the approach for easing restrictions including a phased move to Level 3 nationally, with a number of exceptions in place for the Christmas period. \u00a0Currently weddings can take place but with a limit of 25 guests for ceremony and reception. Additionally couples resident in a particular county, but with existing plans to get married can travel to get married outside that county. Unfortunately neither live music nor dancing is permitted at weddings.<\/p>  <p>  Each level of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The risk level at this time has meant that some activities have not been\u00a0permitted such as live music or dancing at weddings. I understand the difficulties these restrictions pose for couples on their special day and the impact on musicians and bands. However, the restrictions are informed by public health understanding of the disease and recognise we can and must prioritise some activities over others at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000071#WRK05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000071#WRK06000"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[42710\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000071#WRK06100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if professional fees are paid by her Department on behalf of employees; if so, the total number involved; and the amount of each fee.","asker":"1486","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>My Department reimburses employees for Professional Membership Fees.

It also has responsibility for the development of strategies for increasing participation in sport, including participation by women and girls. \u00a0In 2019, Sport Ireland launched its Policy on Women in Sport. The policy expresses Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to women in sport. It builds on the significant work that has already been undertaken in this area within the sport sector to date and, in recognising the opportunity to make a significant impact on the lives of women through their involvement in sport, it provides a blueprint for Sport Ireland&rsquo;s future work.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland does not provide funding direct to clubs but channels its funding through the National Governing Bodies of sport (NGBs).\u00a0 In addition to funding allocated to NGBs under core grants and high performance programme, Sport Ireland also allocates funding to NGBs under the Women in Sport (WIS) programme. The WIS programme was established in 2005 and has provided funding support of over\u00a0&euro;20 million\u00a0to a broad range of programmes aimed at increasing participation by women and girls.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the new Women in Sport Policy, a revised Women in Sport investment programme was launched last year with an investment of &euro;3 million over the two years 2019 and 2020. This doubled the funding for the Women in Sport programme.\u00a0\u00a0 The two year funding will enable NGBs to make significant progress in their strategic objectives for women in sport.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am arranging for Sport Ireland to provide the Deputy with a comprehensive outline of its strategies and initiatives in place to increase participation by women and girls.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact my private office if you do not\u00a0receive a response\u00a0within ten working days.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to capital supports, the\u00a0Sports\u00a0Capital\u00a0and Equipment Programme\u00a0(SCEP)\u00a0is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of\u00a0sports\u00a0and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal\u00a0sports\u00a0equipment throughout the country. The\u00a0Programme\u00a0for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritise the investment in disadvantaged areas. On 30th November, Minister Catherine Martin and I announced that a new 2020 round of the Programme was opening with applications accepted up until 12th February, 2021. At least &euro;40 million is being made available. One\u00a0of the key criteria in scoring applications has always been whether the proposed project will increase participation including the likelihood of increasing female participation.\u00a0I expect that projects likely to increase female participation will again be prioritised when the scoring system for this new round is finalised.<\/p>  <p>  With regard\u00a0to structural funding inequalities, I believe that these can best be addressed by the development of a common funding approach and framework to guide an equitable distribution of State funding in the future. I have already discussed this matter with Sport Ireland and I am committed to ensuring that it is progressed in the short term.

Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage.<\/p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.<\/p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the\u00a0new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility\u00a0to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.\u00a0 This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.\u00a0 It will allow cost-covering rents to be set a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants.

A number of work strands are underway to deliver Cost Rental housing, with State support, through a number of delivery pathways, utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA), and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A Cost Rental Working Group was established by then Minister in 2019, bringing together representatives from the Departments of Housing, Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, the LDA, the Residential Tenancies Board, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council. The Group&rsquo;s deliberations have informed the Government&rsquo;s current plans for Cost Rental, particularly relating to the initial on-balance sheet delivery of State-supported schemes, aimed at moderate-income households, which leverage public land or other Exchequer inputs in order to achieve lower rents. In recent months my officials have undertaken further work in this regard, which led in Budget 2021 to the development of a new funding stream for Cost Rental and forthcoming legislation to regulate this new sector, as outlined below.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A research consultancy on Cost Rental sponsored by the European Investment Bank (EIB)\u00a0on behalf of my Department is also ongoing at present. The EIB has extensive experience in supporting the delivery of affordable housing across Europe, and the final consultancy report is scheduled for completion in January 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A number of Cost Rental developments are already underway. An AHB-led project at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown will deliver 50 Cost Rental homes in Quarter 3 of 2021. This has been supported by the Local Authority through low-cost land and Exchequer funding from my Department of &euro;4 million through the Serviced Sites Fund.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Further large-scale Cost Rental projects are planned, including a Dublin City Council-led development at Emmet Road, Inchicore, Dublin City, which is projected to deliver 375 Cost Rental homes and is currently at the design stage. A public consultation process is active, and I understand that the Council\u00a0intends to lodge a planning application in early 2021. The LDA&rsquo;s first project, a joint venture with D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council at Shanganagh, Shankill, includes 306 Cost Rental homes. The project received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in July 2020 and construction is expected to begin in early 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the delivery of these developments, and in order to accelerate delivery of Cost Rental in the near term, as part of Budget 2021 I announced a specific funding stream for Cost Rental projects being undertaken by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). This\u00a0Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme will see &euro;35 million of long-term loans on favourable terms made available to AHBs to support the delivery of approximately 350 Cost Rental homes next year. CREL will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social homes. It is anticipated that a call for CREL applications from AHBs will issue very shortly in order to facilitate the allocation of funding as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  When combined with the 50 Cost Rental homes to be delivered at Enniskerry Road, the additional homes under the CREL scheme should see up to 400 Cost Rental homes delivered in 2021, through a combination of SSF and CREL funding, in addition to the corresponding debt finance provided by the Housing Finance Agency. As per the underlying policy, rents for all Cost Rental units will be as a result of the cost of delivery, less State capital subvention through mechanisms such as SSF and CREL.\u00a0For example,\u00a0the rents at Enniskerry Road will be &euro;1,200 per month for a two bedroom apartment, in an area where rents for comparable homes on the private market are approximately &euro;2,000 per month. While rents for units funded through the new CREL scheme will only become clear through the application process for funding by AHBs, I expect that rents for these units will be\u00a0comparable to those at Enniskerry Road.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I also intend to place Ireland&rsquo;s new Cost Rental sector on a statutory footing in the new Affordable Housing Bill, which I plan to bring to Government in the coming weeks. While precise eligibility conditions and operational matters for Cost Rental are being finalised by my officials as part of this process, this legislation will be an important element in defining and regulating this new sector.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":701,"content":"<p>Question No. 261 answered with Question No. 257.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[42678\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the progress which has been made on the national differential rent scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to bringing forward a package of social housing reforms, which includes standardising the differential rents regime across the country to ensure fairness.\u00a0 Work on the review of the current\u00a0rent schemes\u00a0has been ongoing and I have asked my Department to prepare recommendations\u00a0regarding the potential\u00a0for a standardised local authority\u00a0rents\u00a0system, which\u00a0I will\u00a0consider in due course\u00a0as part of\u00a0a package of social housing reforms.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL04200"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[42679\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the annual expenditure on HAP for each year that the payment has been in operation; and the amount spent to date in 2020 on HAP in tabular form.","asker":"1551","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":707,"content":"<p>Total expenditure by my Department on the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) for the period that the scheme has been in operation 2014 &ndash; 2019,\u00a0 and the amount spent in 2020\u00a0for HAP at\u00a0end November\u00a02020 is in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year\u00a0<\/th>       <th>Outturn &euro;M\u00a0<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014<\/td>       <td>0.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015<\/td>       <td>15.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>57.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>152.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>276.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>382.4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>412.9 (up to end November)<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[42680\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of households that have had HAP payments cease due to arrears in 2020; the average length of time the households were in arrears before payment was ceased; and the average rental arrears owed by households at the time HAP payments ceased.","asker":"1551","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>Tenants in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)\u00a0scheme are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme.

This policy\u00a0includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. However, in the vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise the landlord. \u00a0<\/p><p>The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants.

This brought about a fundamental change in the operation of the RTB by expanding its regulatory remit.<\/p>  <p>  The breaches of rental law that the Investigations &amp;amp; Sanctions (I&amp;S)\u00a0unit can investigate include; failure to comply with RPZ requirements; failure to register a tenancy; a reason given on a notice of termination that is known to be false or misleading; and failure to offer a tenant their tenancy back when certain conditions have been met.

Landlords are also given the opportunity to acknowledge the breach at an early stage. An acknowledgement of improper conduct and the extent and timeliness of any steps taken by the landlord to end the improper conduct and to remedy its consequences may also be taken into consideration by independent Decision Makers. All sanctions recommended by the Decision Makers must be confirmed by the Circuit Court. Once confirmed by the Court the decision is issued to the landlord and the complainant, if applicable and is published by the RTB.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019 the RTB has analysed over 1,000 contacts from members of the public to its dedicated Investigations channel as well as data from the RTB&rsquo;s own systems, open source data from rental websites and advertising platforms, and data shared with the RTB from local authorities and the\u00a0Department of Employment and Social Protection to identify potential breaches of rental law that can be investigated.<\/p>  <p>  To the end of quarter 3 2020 over 250 investigations were approved. The most common allegation investigated to date is breach of Rent Pressure Zone requirements.<\/p>  <p>  To date over &euro;75,000 has been refunded to current and former tenants as a direct result of the investigation process. Over 50 decisions have been made by the independent decision makers. Once decisions have been confirmed by the Circuit Court and the Court Order issued to the landlord the Order will be published on the RTB&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, the Investigations and Sanctions unit will continue to develop its risk based approach to proactive investigation of suspected improper conduct by landlords.This would mean that the RTB is using its resources to best effect to target investigations where the risk to past, present or future tenants is the highest thus building public trust and confidence in the RTB as a credible regulator.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, the RTB will continue to develop and implement a stakeholder engagement plan which will communicate the role and impact of the new Investigations and Sanctions function to encourage compliance with rental law including the publication of Court confirmed sanctions. In addition, it will focus on sharing key metrics which demonstrate the overall societal impact of the RTB&rsquo;s expanded regulatory remit and will demonstrate how landlords can comply as well as the implications of non-compliance.<\/p>  <p>  The RTB will also continue to commence new investigations with priority on investigating allegations of improper conduct raised by members of the public and other government agencies through concerns and formal written complaints.<\/p>  <p>  More information on the RTB&rsquo;s Investigation and Sanction function is available on the RTB website<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":723,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL06000"},{"type":"question","counter":724,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[42704\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL06100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if professional fees are paid by his Department on behalf of employees; if so, the total number involved; and the amount of each fee.","asker":"1486","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":725,"content":"<p>In supporting &lsquo;Continuous Professional Development&rsquo; (CPD), my Department's Training and Development Strategy recognises the value of membership of professional bodies in the context of keeping pace with the latest professional standards and practices.<\/p><p>In 2020,\u00a071 professional fees were paid totaling<b>&euro;28,080.68<\/b><\/p><p>A full breakdown is contained in the attached Excel spreadsheet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL06300"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[42726\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000072#WRL06400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the position of CEO will be advertised for Galway County Council in view of the length of time that has elapsed since the last CEO left the Council and an acting CEO was appointed (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in 2014, the then Minister appointed a temporary Chief Executive\u00a0for Galway County Council\u00a0until a permanent appointment was made.

This assessment involves analysing the income, expenditure and inflation assumptions against a standard set of assumptions agreed with my Department.

The maximum personal rate for jobseekers is &euro;203 which also provides increased allowances for adult and child dependents.<\/p>  <p>  A self-employed individual who transitions from PUP may be eligible for support under the Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Support Grant that provides support of\u00a0up to &euro;1,000 with business re-start costs.\u00a0 To date, this support has assisted over 7,400 businesses\u00a0transitioning from the pandemic unemployment payment at a cost of approximately &euro;6.9 million.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Funding of\u00a0&euro;12 million had been made available for this grant in 2020.\u00a0 As part of the Budget 2021 measures, an additional &euro;12 million has been allocated to the grant so that it will be available to business owners who may not be in a position to re-start their business and transition from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment until 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for housing related issues rests with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported remains through on-going engagement with their lender to explore a sustainable and appropriate response from their lending institution.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) 2013, measures and policies are in place to support customers in financial difficulty with their mortgage commitments.\u00a0 The CCMA issued by the Central Bank under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and ensures that the responsibility of forbearance remains with the mortgage service provider.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA provides support for those that are in arrears, pre-arrears or those who fall under scope of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).\u00a0 Under the CCMA, lending institutions are encouraging customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being. <\/p>  <p>  A cross-industry co-ordination Group, chaired by Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), is looking at all coronavirus related issues that may impact customers.\u00a0 This includes both the overall economic impact of the coronavirus situation and its direct effect on customers.\u00a0 A number of emergency measures have also been announced by individual lending bodies including increased overdraft facilities and increased\u00a0credit card and cash withdrawal limits.<\/p>  <p>  For those mortgage holders coming to an end of a COVID-19 payment break, lenders will need to assess the position with the borrower to see if they are in a position to resume loan repayments.\u00a0 For those borrowers who will still be impacted by COVID-19 or who will otherwise need further support and assistance, lenders will need to consider the situation on a &lsquo;case-by-case&rsquo; basis and to provide further support having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.<\/p>  <p>  Support is also available from Abhaile, the national mortgage arrears resolution service.\u00a0 It is provided free of charge to borrowers who are at risk of losing their home due to mortgage arrears. \u00a0Abhaile is focussed on providing expert financial and legal advice and assistance to borrowers to identify and put in place solutions to their arrears, and wherever possible, enable the borrowers remain in their home.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000074#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":835,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000074#WRN02200"},{"type":"question","counter":836,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[42590\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000074#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the way in which trainee nurses will be able to avail of the pandemic unemployment payment;

An Expert Group is leading on this work, with a central objective being to\u00a0consider a mechanism to control fees. <\/p>  <p>  Extensive research has already been\u00a0commissioned to inform the Expert Group's\u00a0work.

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with\u00a0these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to\u00a0student accommodation closely.<\/p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.<\/p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). <\/p>  <p>  I have asked\u00a0our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year, as well as flexibility with regard\u00a0to cancellations and refunds.\u00a0All seven universities have confirmed that students who choose to vacate their university-owned accommodation early will receive pro-rata refunds. The exact details of these refunds vary by institution, and students are encouraged to engage with their university directly on this manner. I would hope that\u00a0that private providers will show the same flexibility, however it is not within the\u00a0my remit\u00a0to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.<\/p>  <p>  The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme where students are studying for the first time or are progressing to study at a higher level e.g. progressing to postgraduate study. To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.<\/p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF).

The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups:<\/p>  <p>  1. Entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education;<\/p>  <p>  2. First-time mature students;<\/p>  <p>  3. Students with disabilities;<\/p>  <p>  4. Part-time\/flexible learners;<\/p>  <p>  5. Further education and training award holders; and<\/p>  <p>  6. Irish Travellers.<\/p>  <p>  The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities.<\/p>  <p>  A Progress Review of the National Access Plan published in December 2018 highlighted several key achievements e.g. increases in participation across a number of target groups, particularly students with disabilities and from socio-economically disadvantaged groups. <\/p>  <p>  The objectives of the National Access Plan are supported by a range of interventions and programmes:<\/p>  <p>  -  Approximately &euro;42 million within core State funding allocated to HEIs is in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from under-represented backgrounds. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups in accessing and successfully completing higher education. <\/p>  <p>  -  Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) which comprises dedicated funding\u00a0to support access to higher education and consists of three strands focussed on increasing the participation of under-represented groups in higher education. Current funding envelope of over &euro;30m from 2016-2022<\/p>  <p>  -  PATH 1 &ndash; Initial funding of &euro;2.7m over three years to support equity of access to teacher education programmes. Continuation of PATH 1 funding for a further three years announced at the start of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  -  PATH 2 (1916 Bursary) &ndash; Commenced in 2017\/18 academic year and consists of 200 bursaries a year for the most socio-economically disadvantaged students from National Access Plan target groups; bursaries worth &euro;5,000 per year. Additional bursaries were announced as part of Budget 2021.<\/p>  <p>  -  PATH 3\u00a0- \u00a0Supports institutional capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies for increasing access to higher education by target groups. Initial funding package of &euro;7.5m over three years<\/p>  <p>  -  Student Assistance Fund\u00a0 - annual funding of &euro;9.1m including ring-fenced funding &euro;1m for part-time students. In recent years, ring-fenced funding has also been provided for students on Professional Master of Education (PME) courses. <\/p>  <p>  -  Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) &ndash; &euro;9.6m in funding every year covering both higher and further education sectors. The purpose of the Fund for Students with Disabilities is to provide funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. Since 2018 it covers part-time students as well.<\/p>  <p>  -  HEAR and DARE schemes - The Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) supports students who have a socio-economic disadvantage to enter higher education on reduced points. Latest data shows that of approximately 4,000 eligible HEAR applicants in 2019, there were just over 2,500 acceptances of a HEAR place. The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a third level alternative admissions scheme for school leavers whose disabilities have had a negative impact on their second level education. Latest data shows that of about 4,000 eligible DARE applicants in 2019, there were just over 2,600 acceptances of a DARE place.<\/p>  <p>  -  A study commissioned by the HEA on the challenges facing mature students in participating in higher education is approaching completion (focussing on trends, challenges and barriers, review of funding supports and guidance systems, recommendations). The report is due to be published in Q1 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the response to COVID-19, a number of policy interventions have also occurred to support the goals of the National Access Plan and in particular to support disadvantaged students who are more likely to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 and associated restrictions:<\/p>  <p>  -  &euro;15 million in support of disadvantaged students in higher and further education in accessing ICT devices <\/p>  <p>  -  &euro;8.1m to double the 2020\/21 SAF allocation <\/p>  <p>  -  &euro;1.9m in the form of a once-off COVID-19 contingency fund to enable HEIs deliver local COVID-19 responses to support disadvantaged students <\/p>  <p>  -  &euro;300,000 for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 on Traveller participation in higher education (Dormant Accounts Funding) <\/p>  <p>  In relation to socio-economically disadvantaged students specifically, the HEA has recently published data analysing the socio-economic profile of our higher education population on the basis of Deprivation Index Scores. This dataset will be of significant benefit to higher education institutions in further developing their access and outreach activities and will also aide in the development of the next National Access Plan in terms of setting our ambitions for the future and measuring progress. Consultation on this new Plan will commence in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  There is currently no national student loan scheme in place in Ireland, as there is in other countries, and so the potential difficulties of administering such a scheme have no impact on access to higher education. Where financial support is provided to students to assist them in accessing higher education it is provided in the form of grants, bursaries or other supports not requiring repayment from the student.<\/p>  <p>  The main financial support available to students hoping to access further or higher education is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme where students are studying for the first time or are progressing to study at a higher level e.g. progressing to postgraduate study. To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. The aim of the student maintenance grant is to make a contribution towards the cost of going to college and to assist students with their living costs while in college. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":895,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[42828\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the degree to which he expects to generate increased interest in the technical side of education in order to ensure the ready availability of a highly-qualified workforce in preparation for an increasingly competitive workplace market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[42830\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of third-level places available academic and technical places available for students in each of the past five years to date; the extent to which changes are likely in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":897,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[42832\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which adequate places have been available in the current years for students pursuing academic or technical courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":898,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[42839\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of places available for third and fourth-level students in the technical and academic sectors currently; his proposals to improve on this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":899,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325, 327, 329 and 336 together.<\/p><p>The distinction between academic and technical courses is not one used by my Department.

From pre-primary through to further and higher education and throughout an individual&rsquo;s career, skills and knowledge need to be continuously enhanced if individuals, employers and countries are to realise their potential.<\/p>  <p>  The expansion of higher education has been a key enabling factor in the growth of the Irish economy over the past four decades. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a destination for a successful research career. Equally, increased participation in higher education has resulted in significant contributions to society and has played a critical role in enriching our cultural life. <\/p>  <p>  Postgraduate education delivered by higher education institutions is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s research system. In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research and innovation skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad.<\/p>  <p>  Our society and the world of work are changing rapidly, and if anything, this will be accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Higher Education Institutions will have an important role in equipping us to manage this change. This will entail agility and innovation in how universities operate. The HEIs across the country responded to this challenge &ndash; providing support staff, equipment, delivering PPE, undertaking research into COVID-19, engaging our citizens through the media as experts and much more. The higher education sector was able to maintain teaching and learning in radically challenging circumstances and also demonstrated the flexibility to meet urgent needs, including the additional university places required following the Leaving Certificate. \u00a0\u00a0What this crisis has shown us is the importance of having talent and skills to support our society and economy deal with the challenges we face. <\/p>  <p>  Challenge-led innovation is an increasingly important concept. Stimulating solutions driven collaboration will foster interdisciplinary consortia of enterprises, HEIs and public service delivery bodies to address major societal challenges. Interdisciplinary research is key to addressing such challenges, and incorporating the &lsquo;human factor&rsquo; is also vital. Societal challenges are typically highly complex, and the engagement of researchers from both Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths can often generate more innovative solutions and new ways of approaching and thinking about problems.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will mean that, in addition to public funding for higher and further education, well over 50% of national public research funding will be under its auspices. This is a great opportunity to bring further cohesion and balance to teaching and research across the further and higher education institutions to ensure that Ireland has the talent and skills to match the changing employment landscape and to keep pace with the advancement of science and build on our position as we aspire to become a global innovation leader.<\/p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 is due to conclude at the end of this year. The Mid-Term review of Innovation 2020 published last year reaffirmed the relevance of the policy objectives of Innovation 2020, including the need to increase investment in research infrastructure and research talent. As part of the consultation process for the successor strategy, which will be developed by my new department, I will work with enterprise agencies and industry groups, as well as the higher education institutes, to manage the future demand for research graduates to ensure we are prepared for the challenges we will face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":909,"content":"<p>Question No. 329 answered with Question No. 325.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":910,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 330 and 331 answered with Question No. 328.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":912,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[42835\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for the advancement of educational programmes to meet the scientific needs of the economy in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":913,"content":"<p>The tertiary education system\u00a0has a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands.

In realising Ireland&rsquo;s aim to have the best education and training service in Europe within a decade, we must provide the most effective and engaging teaching, learning and assessment environment for STEM education at all levels.\u00a0The STEM implementation plan builds on a range of reforms and initiatives already underway in STEM, in areas such as curriculum and assessment reform, teacher professional development, embedding digital learning and advances in initial teacher education.<\/p><p>Increasing the numbers of females in STEM is a key action in the STEM Education Implementation Plan. There is a need to attract more females into STEM subjects at school level and ensure that they engage in STEM courses at higher or further education. At further and higher education there is a need for a focus on retention as there is a higher attrition rate for females leaving STEM careers than for males. <\/p><p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment\u00a0has forecast that the number of research personnel employed within our knowledge-intensive industries will increase from 25,000 to 40,000 in the next four years. Thus increasing demand for graduates with STEM-related skills and qualifications across different sectors of the economy. Greater retention in STEM courses at Further and Higher Education will ensure that we have qualified people with the right skills to attract job opportunities and investment in these sectors. <table>

I intend to publish and start to implement an Action Plan to tackle economic crime and corruption early in the New Year, which I have secured Government approval to do. <\/p><p>I would like to thank the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr James Hamilton, and the members of his Review Group for their meticulous work in preparing their detailed report, which I am determined to act on. <\/p><p>Corruption and &lsquo;white-collar crime&rsquo; damages our economy, breeds cynicism in our society and is a threat to our international reputation. As noted in the detailed report recently published, Ireland is a relatively small country with a population approaching 5 million. However, Ireland is listed as the fifth largest provider of wholesale financial services in the EU with more than 400 international financial institutions located here. The State and its agencies must have all the powers available to clamp down and prevent this type of crime. <\/p><p>Ireland has a hard won reputation as an attractive destination for foreign direct investment and as an international business hub and stepping up our efforts to tackle white collar crime shows we&rsquo;re serious about maintaining and building that reputation. <\/p><p>Businesses large and small must be confident they can operate safely and securely, particularly as more economic activity goes online, a trend we have seen accelerate with COVID-19. But it is not just about businesses, consumers too should know they can safely pay their bills and shop online. <\/p><p>The recommendations in the  Hamilton Review focus primarily on legislative, structural and resourcing measures to enhance agency and multi-agency enforcement as well as increasing capacity across the criminal justice system to prevent this crime. Examples of the recommendations include: greater powers for investigating agencies to tackle economic crime and corruption; the establishment of an Advisory Council against Economic Crime and Corruption; reform of the Ethics Acts; and additional resourcing for SIPO, DPP, Garda National and Economic Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government recognises the reputational and economic damage that corruption and white collar crime can cause to the State and commits the Government to introduce and implement new anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures. <\/p><p>The development of our new plan to tackle economic crime and corruption will be informed by the recommendations of the Hamilton review. Work has already begun across Government to develop this action plan, which will set clear timelines for the introduction of a series of reforms to strengthen the State&rsquo;s capacity to prevent and prosecute white-collar crime. <\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that Garda&iacute; have the resources, both in terms of people and technology, to combat all forms of crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021. This level of funding is enabling sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff as well as driving significant developments in ICT.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) is the main Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tasked with tackling economic crime. The Bureau operates on a national basis and provides specialist support and guidance to regional investigators.<\/p><p>I understand that there are currently competitions underway to strengthen the staffing levels in the GNECB&rsquo;s Financial Intelligence Unit and the GNECB itself as well as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. This includes 11 new permanent Detective Sergeants who are due to be allocated to the GNECB this month, with additional resources expected in 2021.<\/p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that there have been a number of significant steps taken in recent years to strengthen the State&rsquo;s ability to tackle corruption and related activities. In particular, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 is a very important piece of legislation in the fight against corruption, both in Ireland and abroad.

This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.  <\/p><p>Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based abuse and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy. <\/p><p>Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, a review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.<\/p><p>Raising public awareness on these issues is a key feature of our overarching response in this area and my Department is currently midway through the No Excuses campaign, a national awareness campaign to tackle domestic and sexual abuse and sexual harassment. The campaign is a key action of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based abuse for 2016 to 2021. The overall aim of the campaign is to make all of us face up to the excuses we, as a society, make for unacceptable behaviours and to call on us to speak out against them. This will contribute to a change in society's attitude to sexual harassment, domestic and sexual abuse in order to decrease and prevent this type of behaviour. <\/p><p>In relation to funding, in 2020 my Department committed almost &euro;1.9 million to support services for victims of crime, including victims of sexual and gender based violence.  These services provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services. I have secured &euro;4.104 million under Budget 2021 to continue supporting these services.  I have also secured &euro;3 million in Budget 2021 for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  <\/p><p>These figures reflect the additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 to support the implementation of the O'Malley review which will support vulnerable victims, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. <\/p><p><i>&lsquo;Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo;<\/i>will be implemented as a priority and it includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey throughout the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. <\/p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. I am aware that Longford\/Roscommon launched its DPSU on 21 September, 2020. The completion of the rollout of DPSUs means that specially trained officers are available nationwide who will be responsible for engagement with, and interviewing of, vulnerable victims.  This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual abuse present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist professional and sensitive expert assistance.<\/p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy, but more importantly to reassure anyone who is a victim, or at risk of domestic abuse, that help continues to be available and to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":946,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06100"},{"type":"question","counter":947,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[42422\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of plans to review the process of issuing rejection letters to international protection applicants while level 5 restrictions remained in place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1597","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":948,"content":"<p>I would firstly like to assure the Deputy that my Department has consistently adopted a pragmatic approach in relation to immigration arrangements in the context of COVID-19. The pragmatic approach to deportation orders will continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  A decision to suspend the issuing of negative international protection decisions during level 5 restrictions had already been taken and this remains in place.  Under the International Protection Act 2015, a person receives a letter informing them of their negative international protection decision and informing them that they no longer have permission to remain in the State. They are required to confirm within 5 days if they will accept the option of voluntary return, for which my Department will provide assistance. The person is not required to remove themselves from the State within 5 days, they are merely required to give an indication of their intentions. <\/p>  <p>  For the duration of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, I asked my officials to review the issuing of the letters; and no refusal letters, or letters enclosing a deportation order, have issued to anyone who has been unsuccessful in seeking international protection since. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to add that, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, there have only been four cases where a person was deported from the State and three of those arose from deportation orders issued prior to March 2020. For the one case where the deportation order was issued since March 2020, that person was returned to Brazil and was not a failed international protection applicant.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of those found not to be in need of international protection, a detailed consideration of all aspects of their case will have been carried out before a decision is made to grant permission to remain in the State or to make a Deportation Order.

In making a revocation request a person can raise new or changed circumstances in their case including in relation to their country of origin.  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to me and my Department so that fully informed decisions can be made at the appropriate time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06400"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[42555\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 586 of 15 September 2020, the status of the general scheme of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture; the status of the promised national preventive mechanism; the way in which the mechanism will be structured; the person that will be in charge of coordinating the mechanism; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":951,"content":"<p>Ireland ratified the UN Convention against Torture in 2002.

The current situation, which was recently communicated to the Council of Europe Committee against Torture is as follows. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed in its Programme for Government to ratifying OPCAT before the end of 2021. My predecessor Minister Flanagan approved our intended approach in that the Inspector of Prisons is to be designated as a single NPM for the Criminal Justice Sector &ndash; places of detention, including Garda stations, courts, prisons, places of transport and transit between Garda stations, prisons and courts. <\/p>  <p>  The matter of designating NPMs to oversee those relevant areas of detention outside the Criminal Justice Sector is a matter for the Minister for Health and the Minister for Defence and from the consultations my officials have had, I understand those Departments are considering the appropriate designations in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, It is anticipated that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) will be designated as the coordinating body for NPMs in this State. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is leading on the preparation for this multiple institution NPM model in terms of developing the necessary legislation for ratification of OPCAT. To this end, the General Scheme of the Inspection of Places of Detention Bill is being drafted and it is intended to bring this to Government for approval in the first quarter of 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting the Office of the Inspector of Prisons in implementing its statutory role. The Inspector of Prisons engaged an independent consultant to assess the resources needed for their office.  The review set out the need for a future Preferred Operational Model (&ldquo;POM&rdquo;) to be implemented, supported by enhanced resourcing. It went further to recommended increasing the staff numbers from 5 to 14 staff (including the Chief Inspector).  Acknowledging this, the 2020 budget was increased by &euro;700,000 bringing it to &euro;1.2million and the 2021 budget by a further circa &euro;750,000 bringing the overall budget for the OIP to &euro;1.95 million. These increases allow the Inspector of Prisons to recruit additional staff. <\/p>  <p>  Competitions for the recruitment of additional staff are nearly completed. This will significantly increase the capacity of the office from its current capacity. My Department will continue to work with the Inspector of Prisons in this regard and in that Office&rsquo;s additional responsibilities and obligations that will flow from the ratification of OPCAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Procedures","counter":952,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06700"},{"type":"question","counter":953,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[42556\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000075#WRO06800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na review into the use of anti-spit hoods has been completed; if she has she received a copy of the review; when the review will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":954,"content":"<p>At the outset I wish to emphasise that the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its operations, including the use of protective equipment.

There is also a Constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. <\/p>  <p>  As previously indicated to the Deputy, public safety is an absolute priority for me as Minister for Justice.  Working to reduce re-offending and minimise the risk of further harm to victims and society, through the implementation of effective evidence-based penal policy, is a key part of that task.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that a number of initiatives were introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC). Community Return and Community Support Schemes were introduced in 2011 and aim to increase support for prisoners prior to their release from prison, upon their release, and then for a period after their release in order to break the cycle of offending; <\/p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC) is a multi-agency response to the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders which commenced in 2014. The programme aims to target prolific offenders who are responsible for large amounts of crime. In order to reduce crime and enhance public safety, the selected prolific offenders are managed through the integration of policy and practice between the J-ARC agencies.<\/p>  <p>  While I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is challenging to relate the impact any one action or any specific legislation has to general re-offending rates as recidivism may be impacted by a number of other variables, such as social influences or other external factors. However, an example of the impact of legislation in this area is the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011. This Act provides that a court shall consider the appropriateness of a community service order in circumstances where a sentence of imprisonment of up to 12 months is being considered.  There has been a consistent increase in the management of community service orders by the Probation Service over the past three years. In 2019, the Probation Service managed 2,791 Community Service Orders, totalling 379,815 hours work, in lieu of 1,247 years in prison, which equated to &euro;3 million of unpaid work.  Despite this, the use of short sentences is something that I am continuing to focus on as their use remains prevalent.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department launched the findings from an international evidence review on recidivism and policy responses. This research report is the third in a series of releases to be commissioned and disseminated by the Research and Data Analytics unit in my Department, was prepared by Prof. Ian O&rsquo;Donnell from the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice, School of Law, UCD. <\/p>  <p>  The review sought to address a range of questions relating to the factors underpinning recidivist and prolific offending behaviour; public policy interventions that tackle recidivism and prolific offending; and the effectiveness of these interventions and likelihood of successful transplantation to an Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  The review will constitute a valuable resource for researchers and act as a springboard for future empirical research on best practice in this area and provide a body of evidence essential to inform future policy discussions and development. The full report, including key finding, is available on the website of my Department and builds on the Department&rsquo;s commitment, outlined in the 2018-2020 Data and Research Strategy, to support the development of more evidence-informed policy making.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more. The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken. Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail and increases the use of curfews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000076#WRP04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":996,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[42817\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000076#WRP04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of offences committed by prisoners while on temporary or short-term release in the past five years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":997,"content":"<p>The Irish Prison Service work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service in respect of the monitoring, supervision and compliance of those on temporary release. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, any prisoner who breaches his or her conditions, including committing a criminal offence, may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute; or may be refused another period of reviewable temporary release.

The strategy sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove the systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. It builds upon a solid foundation of employment supports already in place across the criminal justice sector and is a collaboration between the Prison and the Probation Service and my Department of Justice. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are various employment focussed interventions which take place along the criminal justice spectrum for those in custody, those preparing for release and for those engaging in Probation funded projects in the community. In addition, people with convictions can avail of the programmes provided through Government Agencies which support training, employment and entrepreneurship. The strategy aims to create a flexible, responsive system that ties all of these interventions together in a coherent, strategic and progressive manner with each intervention building on the previous ones, for the benefit of people with convictions and communities they return to.<\/p>  <p>  A copy of the Strategy can be found on my Departmental website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000076#WRP05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service Staff","counter":1010,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000076#WRP05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1011,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[42822\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000076#WRP05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which the full complement of staff remains available throughout the Irish Prison Service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1012,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[42823\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000076#WRP05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of promotional positions to be filled throughout the Irish Prison Service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1013,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 367 and 368 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy\u00a0will be aware, the\u00a0Irish Prison Service operates as an\u00a0executive office within the Department of Justice and Equality.

It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.<\/p><p>The Government's medium-term Plan Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key\u00a0priorities\u00a0of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and\u00a0childcare\u00a0services open and\u00a0protecting\u00a0the most vulnerable members of our communities.<\/p><p>The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.\u00a0 Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.\u00a0 Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease.\u00a0<\/p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.\u00a0The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan are designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes.\u00a0It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.\u00a0<\/p><p>The measures in place at each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I would like to draw your attention to the\u00a0CSO\u00a0website for access to a range of data relating to Covid-19 including data on confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to outbreak location.

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. <\/p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed. <\/p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.<\/p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I have recently committed to holding an inquiry into the historical licensing and use of sodium valproate in Ireland, and have asked officials in my department to examine a number of different options for the structure of this inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paediatric Services","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[42626\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the severe shortage of paediatric rheumatologists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1512","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":1149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR03925"},{"type":"question","counter":1150,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[42627\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR03950","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an information leaflet compiled by parents of children with Down&rsquo;s arthropathy; and his plans distribute it to general practitioner surgeries and other health professionals to facilitate prompt referrals.","asker":"1512","askee":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1151,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paediatric Services","counter":1152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1153,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[42628\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000078#WRR04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the lengthy waiting lists for children with Down&rsquo;s arthropathy to see paediatric rheumatologists, either privately or publicly; the outcome of a meeting held on 18 December 2019 between the rheumatology department of Crumlin Children&rsquo;s Hospital and an organisation (details supplied) on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1512","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1154,"content":"<p>I sincerely regret that children can experience a long waiting time for Rheumatology treatment, and I am conscious of the burden that this places on them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) has advised my Department that during the initial phases of COVID-19, all face to face hospital outpatient reviews and most of the planned diagnostic tests, including MRI, were deferred in response to the pandemic.\u00a0 CHI at Crumlin have recommenced the majority of outpatient and diagnostic services, albeit at reduced numbers, due to public health guidelines on social distancing.\u00a0 Currently, Consultant Rheumatologists are seeing a number of patients in the outpatient suite including urgent patients and those who were deferred during the early phases of COVID-19.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  CHI has further advised that there is an active recruitment campaign for an additional Rheumatology Consultant underway.

Endocrinology and psychological support services are delivered on both sites. A model of care was developed to support the development of HSE gender identity services. The model of care was supported by the allocation of additional resources to enhance services. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If the National Gender Service (NGS) identifies someone who is at high risk of harm with regard to their social health as a result of hormone therapy, then an individualised care plan is formulated to reduce this risk. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This care plan may in some very specific instances include family meetings (with relevant family\u00a0members such as parents). The NGS offers a variety of interventions to address any social health risk involving personal relationships. This can include family meetings at HSE offices, home visits from a member of the NGS team, family therapy, or\/and individualised social work intervention (e.g. securing independent housing or income). The rationale of the care plan is explained to the individual during and following assessment. At all times during this process, data protection regulations are fully observed and all clinicians work in line with the relevant professional guidelines. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This care plan can be experienced by the person attending the service as an insistence that they bring their parents with them to approve their plans for hormonal or surgical transition. However, parents have no say in the person's care. As long as the person has capacity to consent then they can proceed to medical intervention once they can say, based on clinical assessment, that the benefits will exceed the risks. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If parents of patients are not supportive, or if the person does not want to involve their parents in their care, then the HSE works with them to secure independent income and housing prior to proceeding to a medical transition. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Irish health insurers are required to have a standard minimum level of cover in every health insurance policy. These requirements are set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts. In addition to this minimum level of cover, it is open to insurers to provide cover for procedures beyond the requirements set out in governing legislation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health and I are\u00a0committed to the development by the HSE of a well-governed and patient-centred health care service for adults and children in the transgender community.

However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Strategy Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key\u00a0priorities\u00a0of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and\u00a0childcare\u00a0services open and\u00a0protecting\u00a0the most vulnerable members of our communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.\u00a0 Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.\u00a0 Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease.\u00a0The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The numbers of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Plan are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Dance classes are regarded as exercise and sporting events under the Plan\u00a0and where possible, such classes can be held online.<\/p>  <p>  Under Levels 3, 4 and 5 indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and sporting events, including classes, cannot take place.<\/p>  <p>  Under Level 2 restrictions, indoor classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people, once sufficient space is available and strict public health protocols are in place.<\/p>  <p>  Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000079#WRS06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":1255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000079#WRS06125"},{"type":"question","counter":1256,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[42807\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000079#WRS06150","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when dupilumab for persons with eczema will be made available in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1257,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000079#WRS06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[42533\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000079#WRS06300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>The Department of Health is currently finalising heads of bill to significantly amend and update mental health legislation, taking into account the 165 recommendations of the Expert Group Review of the 2001 Act, which was informed in part by a public consultation, a comprehensive submission by the Mental Health Commission, and Ireland&rsquo;s domestic and international commitments, such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\u00a0 The provisions of the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018 are also being incorporated into the draft heads of bill.<\/p>  <p>  There are over one hundred sections in the draft heads.

Such measures were designed to improve selectivity by requiring the\u00a0use of gear that have lower levels of by-catches of cod and whiting in the areas where such catches are significant, thus decreasing the fishing mortality of this stock in mixed fisheries. The TACs set for these species were\u00a0set at a level designed to avoid potential discarding, which could undermine data collection and scientific assessment of the stock and to ensure rapid return of the stock to levels capable of producing MSY. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission requested\u00a0its Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) to review the impacts of these remedial measures\u00a0and to assess the ongoing\u00a0measures proposed by the North Western Waters Group of Member States, of which Ireland is a member. In their findings, STECF noted that the measures\u00a0 proposed should as a minimum lead to benefits for the conservation of marine biological resources by reducing the catches of juveniles. However, STECF did note that to carry out a full analysis, disaggregated quantitative data specific to the fisheries studied are needed. Monitoring of catch data by fishing operation or trip (including levels of discards) from the fishery\u00a0is required to estimate the proportion and total volume of historical catches of by-catch species below or above the given catch thresholds specified in the Regulation. This will\u00a0provide accurate data on the levels of by-catch of cod and whiting and identify the vessels that have by-catches of a sufficient level to require the use of the selective gears set out in the Regulation. Following on from the STECF advice, the Commission has requested that Member States provide such information in order to allow such an assessment to be carried out. Ireland is working with the other Member States to supply such information based on observer data provided by the Marine Institute and logbook data provided from the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). <\/p>  <p>  With regards to additional control measures to ensure by-catch TACs are enforced, the EU Commission has proposed amendments to the EU Fisheries control framework.\u00a0Negotiations on the new Fisheries Control Regulation\u00a0are currently ongoing in both the EU Council and the European Parliament.\u00a0 Some of the measures being considered include provisions for full catch documentation, such as Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) which involves, for example the use of CCTV cameras on vessels.\u00a0 Ireland is supportive of\u00a0the proposed introduction of a\u00a0risk-based REM system.\u00a0\u00a0As a Coastal Member State, Ireland supports this proposal\u00a0provided\u00a0that Coastal States\u00a0has access to the\u00a0data gathered within this system on a\u00a0near real time\u00a0basis to support the work of the\u00a0control authorities.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000080#WRT04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000080#WRT04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1308,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[42650\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000080#WRT04900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of times CASA aircraft were deployed to monitor the fishing activities of supertrawlers; the names of the vessels the aircraft were deployed to monitor in each of the past ten years in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1463","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1309,"content":"<p>The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are law enforcement matters for the Irish control authorities.Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, all operational\u00a0matters\u00a0are exclusively the responsibility of\u00a0the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service.\u00a0 Under the Act, \u00a0I am expressly precluded from getting involved in operational matters in relation to sea fisheries control.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I have referred the Deputy's requests to\u00a0the SFPA for attention and direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000080#WRT05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Meat Processing Plants","counter":1310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000080#WRT05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[42657\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121000080#WRT05200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 271 of 25 November 2020, if environmental samples were gathered at any other meat processing plants since July 2020 other than in the course of the referenced pilot project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1312,"content":"<p>Environmental monitoring (bio-aerosol measurement) has not been undertaken in any meat processing plant\u00a0other than that which was undertaken as part of a retrospective investigation (in late July\/early August) in the pilot study plant, in which a COVID-19 outbreak had occured in April 2020. <\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the report of this pilot study has been shared with other meat plant operators (via Meat Industry Ireland),\u00a0with the public health authorities\u00a0and with other relevant state agencies.\u00a0Therefore, the\u00a0findings from this pilot study are now informing COVID-19 risk mitigation and management in meat plants.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore,\u00a0my Department\u00a0is currently collaborating with other state agencies, university-based researchers and meat plant operators in further studies of risk factors and enhanced measures for risk mitigation for COVID-19 in meat processing plants.

To date in 2020, officers from the Carcase Classification Division of my Department have conducted 405 inspections across 32 factories.  There were 302 inspections in factories where mechanical classification is carried out and 103 inspections in the nine manual grading factories.  Over 36,000 carcasses were inspected.  The average number of inspections to date in 2020 per factory was 12 and the average number of carcasses inspected at each inspection was 88.  The legal requirement is eight inspections per year and a minimum of 40 carcasses at each inspection.  These inspection figures significantly exceed the numbers required under the relevant EU legislation. <\/p>  <p>  These unannounced checks by classification officers verify the on-going accuracy of the automated beef grading methods by using a system of points and limits defined in EU legislation. The mechanical classification method must operate within legally defined tolerances at all times.  When any mechanical system is found to be working outside of these tolerances, the meat plants concerned are instructed to revert to manual grading.  Farmers are advised through their remittance dockets where manual grading is applied. <\/p>  <p>  The suspension of mechanical grading following an inspection by DAFM occurred on four occasions to date in 2020 and the factories in questions were instructed to revert to manual grading.  In all instances, classification officers from my Department conducted a classification check before a factory was allowed to recommence mechanical grading.  <\/p>  <p>  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017\/1184 of 20 April 2017 sets out the legal tolerances for authorisation of a mechanical classification system. The figure quoted of 60% is the minimum accuracy figure for conformation and fat cover that must be achieved for a mechanical classification system to be authorised for use in any EU state. The average performance for conformation in Ireland in 2019 was 93.3% and 95.1% for fat cover.   To date in 2020, average performance for conformation is 93.3% and 95.6% for fat cover.<\/p>  <p>  The role of my Department is clearly defined in the Irish legislation (SI 249\/2019) in terms of monitoring and supervision of classification, weights and carcase presentation.
