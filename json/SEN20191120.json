I will be brief and concise.  This is to ask the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to consider changing the terms and conditions that would allow registered agricultural contractors to apply for TAMS or LESS.  The background to this is that these contractors provide employment in rural communities and should be eligible for such grants, subject of course to conditions.  The Minister will appreciate the cost of machinery and the fact there is co-operation between neighbouring farmers and contract farmers.  People do not always have heavy plant and machinery.<\/p> <p>This is an issue registered contractors have raised with me.  They believe there should be some support for them.  They are not necessarily farm owners, although some are small farm owners, and they are supplementing their income by doing this work.<\/p> <p>I will tell the Minister about one Galway contractor who wrote to me.  He said he was a registered agricultural contractor, had been in this business for over 40 years and had never received any grants as he did not own a farm.  He said that he thought all registered agricultural contractors who provide this service and employment in the local community should be eligible for the same grant.  He said also that he had applied for the low emissions slurry spreading equipment scheme, LESS, grant, and it was denied to him because he did not own land but that most of his customers were dependent on him to provide this service.<\/p> <p>He talked about having a son who was keen to take on this agricultural contracting business, which is essential and used widely by farmers in their community.  He then talked about the whole issue of emissions, the reduction of the carbon footprint, etc.  The Minister will be very familiar with the whole story and I am interested in his considered response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#A00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to provide an update on the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, known as TAMS II, and I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  TAMS II is made up of a suite of seven measures providing valuable grant aid to Irish farmers.  These measures were launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, RDP, and are co-funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  Because of this, they are subject to all the provisions of the relevant EU regulations.  These regulations specify that TAMS II support be granted to farmers or groups of farmers.  It is not therefore possible under the EU regulation for Ireland to amend the terms and conditions to extend the grant aid available under TAMS II to contractors who are not farmers.<\/p> <p>There are seven measures available under TAMS II providing grants for capital investment in physical assets.  Under the young farmers capital investment scheme, additional support is available for young trained farmers, as they are offered a higher rate of grant aid of 60% compared to the standard rate of 40%.  The specific measure being raised by Senator Boyhan is the low emission slurry spreading scheme.  Uptake under this measure has been particularly high, with more than 2,500 approvals issued and more than 1,100 applications paid to date.  I welcome the high level of uptake under this measure, as it delivers real environmental dividends and is evidence of the willingness of Irish farmers to embrace new technologies that benefit the environment and contribute to climate change mitigation.<\/p> <p>The eligibility requirements for the low emission slurry spreading scheme are set out in the terms and conditions and indicate that the scheme is open to farmers who hold a Department identifier and have declared a minimum of 5 ha under the basic payment scheme in the year of application or preceding year, or have a minimum of 60 production units in the case of pig farmers.<\/p> <p>To date, total expenditure on LESS equipment is &euro;19 million, of which &euro;6.5 million has been paid to qualifying young farmers.  It is open to approved applicants to submit an online payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.

The eligible person has to be a landowner or a farmer, so who is looking out for these guys?  The Minister and I are very familiar with a number of small contractors.  Where do they fit into all of this?  In this whole big conglomerate of the European Union, where is the relevance for local communities?  We hear right across the country that farm communities are struggling.  Somebody who takes a lease on a piece of machinery and tries to offer services in his or her community, who is bedded down and respected in his or her community, is offering a service.  Who is going to financially support and assist that person?  Is there any other mechanism through which such a person can apply for funding?  What can the Minister do?  What reassurance can he give me that he will look at this, particularly in regard to the small contractor?<br\/><br\/>The person should not have to be a farm owner or be involved in agriculture.  We have more graduates and students studying agriculture at the moment who live in cities than ever owned land and, in many cases, they have never been involved in agriculture.  We have to acknowledge and recognise there is a new shift and a new interest among people coming into agriculture.  Clearly, I will send this to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>, and other media to say this is the response.  This is the Minister's response, which is accurate, and I appreciate the Minister taking the time to do that.

I do not undervalue or under-appreciate the contribution of either but I accept that, in some respects, some contractors, by virtue of being both contractors and landowners, have an advantage in terms of their eligibility for grant aid.  The dilemma I face is that, under EU regulations, it is not open to me to provide funding to non-farmers under this scheme.<\/p> <p>The scheme is critical, as are all of the schemes under TAMS II, but this is particularly so in the context of climate, and we are out in public consultation in the context of the roadmap we envisage for meeting our ambitious targets in the agricultural area.  We are also at present engaged in deliberations about what the next Common Agricultural Policy could be, so it may be an opportune time to look at those regulations in that context.  I accept personally that, in terms of the scarce resources available to farmers, it is not necessary for every farmer to have low-emissions slurry spreading equipment but it is obligatory, in the context of our ambition, that all farmyard manures would be spread in the most environmentally friendly way possible.  Given the capital cost, much of that can be done, and most effectively in financial terms, through contractors.<\/p> <p>How we might marry the two issues - the reform of CAP and our climate ambition - is somewhere I see opportunity in terms of using the toolbox that the new CAP can give us to drive that agenda in the most environmentally and financially efficient way.  That could include opening the door, if it were possible in the context of the new CAP, although I am not committing to that as it is a deliberative process which we are in consultation about.<\/p> <p>I accept this is expensive equipment.  It is beyond the reach of many farmers and, in many cases, given the individual farmer's scale, and notwithstanding the period when it is optimum to use the low emissions slurry spreading equipment, it is questionable whether every farmer should be obliged to own it, or whether, through a co-operative purchasing system or through extended the availability of assistance to contractors, there is an optimum solution.  It is something we can set our minds to considering in the context of climate and the reform of CAP.  However, under the current regulations, as drafted, it is not open to me to consider them under TAMS as currently constructed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#B00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","time":1574245800,"counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#B00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Creed, has great knowledge of Kinsale and his father covered that area for many years.  His knowledge of Kinsale is very appropriate to this matter.  I am looking for movement on the Gaelscoil in Kinsale, which was established in 2007.  It first got approval for a permanent structure in 2015 and, since then, it has been sitting in limbo.  We have a site and we are trying to get the conveyancing sorted for the site.  My office in Kinsale has been in contact with both the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Department of Education and Skills every month for the last year, trying to get movement on the conveyancing of the site.  Since October 2018, it has sat in the Chief State Solicitor's office and we have been trying to get contracts out of that office since that time.<\/p> <p>There is deep frustration in Kinsale on this issue.  The Gaelscoil is a thriving school in a thriving town that just needs a little help to move forward.  We have the site and we need to move forward with regard to the ownership of that site so we can move from stage 1 of the project list all the way to stage 5 in the next few years.  There was an original commitment that construction would begin on this site in 2018 and we are now lagging behind because we do not have ownership of the site.  In many ways, this is about making sure we can transfer the land over to the Department and then move forward with the next phases of the project.<\/p> <p>It is a very important project for Kinsale.  I want to bring to the Minister's attention that over &euro;1 million has been spent on prefabs since 2007 and, in many ways, it is money wasted.  Every day that we delay, more money is being spent on temporary prefabs, which do not suit the needs of the students.  One of these prefabs had to be stood down last year because of its condition, with rain literally pouring through it.  This is a significant issue for Kinsale, a thriving town that has seen its population increase by 22% in the last decade.  We need to move forward with the educational campus, in particular the Gaelscoil.  I hope the Department can put pressure on the Chief State Solicitor's office to sort out the conveyancing issues and get the site transferred over, so we can go through the phases to deliver this site and, in turn, deliver the school for Kinsale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#B00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.

The Gaelscoil is currently operating in temporary accommodation, as the Senator said.<\/p> <p>The project to provide the new building for the Gaelscoil required the acquisition of a site for the school.  In order to secure a suitable site, the Department of Education and Skills worked closely with Cork County Council under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites and a number of site options were identified by the council.  These were all thoroughly appraised for suitability by both officials from the Department of Education and Skills and from Cork County Council.  The Senator will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options at this point in order to ensure the achievement of value for money and to minimise the potential of any issues arising during the planning and development stages.<\/p> <p>The outcome of this technical appraisal exercise was that council officials, acting on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, entered into negotiations with the landowners of the site on which the Gaelscoil is currently located in temporary accommodation as it was deemed to be the most suitable option.

The conveyancing process remains under way as legal due diligence must be undertaken in respect of any such proposed transaction.

He is probably aware of the desperate situation regarding ambulance services in rural areas.  Councillor Erin McGreehan from Louth recently raised with me the specific issue of ambulances in the Omeath area of north County Louth.  At present no ambulances are operating in this district of the county.<\/p> <p>It has been revealed that ambulance services in Louth have taken over an hour to respond to emergency call-outs on at least six different occasions in the last year.  A freedom of information request has revealed that on one emergency occasion in Louth last year it took an hour and 27 minutes for an ambulance to arrive at the scene.  Out of the six occasions where ambulances took more than an hour to respond in the county, waiting times were between an hour 18 minutes and an hour 27 minutes.<\/p> <p>This is not to do with trolleys backing up and the dysfunctional situation in our emergency departments.  Insufficient resources are being directed towards rural areas.  What does the Minister of State plan to do, in a holistic fashion, to deal with this issue and ensure that we can get the ambulances to bring the patients to the hospitals in a timely fashion?<\/p> <p>Ambulance turnaround times measure the time interval from ambulance arrival at a hospital to when the crew is ready to accept another call.  In a number of hospitals, the emergency departments are completely overcrowded and this will get worse with the winter flu season approaching.  This overcrowding contributes significantly to delays in ambulance turnaround.  The lack of resources in rural areas is a different problem.  We are not dedicating enough resources to rural locations.  If we are serious about reducing the turnaround times, it means that we need to reduce the length of time people are spending in our emergency departments.  With that in mind the escalating overcrowding in hospitals being reported by the INMO's figures is of particular concern.  We have a long way to go in this regard and the failure to recruit more nurses has exacerbated the issue.<\/p> <p>I accept that there are challenges in rural areas and that we cannot expect to achieve the same turnaround times as urban areas, but they could be vastly improved.  We need to increase the number of ambulances and paramedics, but we also need to support community first responders to help with emergencies in rural areas.<\/p> <p>Details released under the Freedom of Information Act show that nationally on 123 occasions this year it has taken an ambulance at least an hour to arrive at a life-threatening emergency.  Some 26 of these were in Wexford while the longest response time was in Mayo.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to Belmullet to visit the district hospital.  While I am talking about Louth today, the Erris Peninsula is as big as the entire county of Louth.  He will be very familiar with this from his part of the country.  We are fortunate to have an ambulance base in Belmullet, albeit an hour and ten minutes away from Castlebar.<\/p> <p>Rural areas need an increased service.  We have a great air ambulance that I have used, thankfully infrequently, as a GP in rural Mayo.  Increasing the number of community paramedics and first responders would be sensible and pragmatic, and may alleviate some of the problems we have today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#C00400","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, regarding the ambulance service in north County Louth.  The National Ambulance Service has three bases in Louth, namely Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee, from which emergency ambulances and intermediate care services are provided.<\/p> <p>The National Ambulance Service has been moving to a policy of dynamic deployment, where vehicles are strategically located where they are most likely to be required, rather than located at a particular station.  In this regard, Louth can also be served by resources based at neighbouring counties.  The adoption of a dynamic deployment approach was recommended in the National Ambulance Service Baseline and Capacity Review, published in 2016.  The ambulance dispatch points were identified following an analysis of demand based on historical data from the regional control rooms.  There are ongoing reviews of rosters and strategic deployments of ambulances in the region to ensure that deployed resources remain relevant to demand.<\/p> <p>The baseline and capacity review also identified particular difficulties serving rural areas.  The review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responder, CFR, schemes.  The National Ambulance Service continues to work with local CFR groups across the region to enhance services with eight CFR groups currently operating in County Louth.<\/p> <p>The National Ambulance Service also works closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to provide a better and more responsive service for patients in Border counties, including County Louth.  Co-operation is formalised in two memoranda of understanding signed in September 2019.<\/p> <p>I note that the Senator seeks the provision of an adequate ambulance service, but I assure him that the Government aspires to the provision of a quality, responsive service.  The National Ambulance Service has undergone a very significant process of modernisation in recent years, and a number of important service innovations and developments have taken place.  The National Emergency Operations Centre has been established, where emergency calls are received and emergency resources are dispatched.  The National Ambulance Service now has full visibility of all available paramedic resources and vehicles in real time, ensuring that the closest available resource is dispatched to an emergency.<\/p> <p>Recent developments also include the development of alternative pathways to care.  The Hear and Treat clinical hub went live in the National Emergency Operations Centre last year.  This is an important service in that it diverts some lower acuity patients away from busy emergency departments and frees up emergency capacity.  These initiatives are helping to improve the availability of ambulance resources throughout the country, including in north County Louth.<\/p> <p>In each of the recent years, additional investment has been directed towards the National Ambulance Service.  This year the National Ambulance Service budget has increased to an unprecedented &euro;168.6 million which supports the National Ambulance Service to continue to deliver a high-quality service.  I can confirm that in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, additional funds will be made available to the National Ambulance Service in 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#C00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.

I seek an update on the planned 12-bed hospice inpatient project for Sligo.  For more than three decades, the North West Hospice has been providing wonderful care to people in counties Sligo and Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan.  The hospice currently provides an inpatient unit, a community palliative care team and a hospice palliative care team.  As many people in the north west will be aware, the hospice is planning a significant project, namely, a 12-bed unit along with day care and outpatient facilities.  This is a major undertaking on the current hospice site with an estimated cost of &euro;8.5 million.  I understand that this project will be funded through a combination of Government funding, financing, corporate support, support from the diaspora and the local community, along with significant donors.<\/p> <p>As representatives of the North West Hospice have stated, this project is crucial to cater for the current and future needs of local communities.  The current inpatient unit comprises eight beds, three single rooms and a five-bed ward.  The 12-bed project will allow for 12 single rooms and I concur with representatives of the hospice that this is essential and vital for the dignity and privacy of patients and their families.  I visited a good friend of mine there nearly two years ago and the service, commitment and dignity shown by the staff, doctors and nurses were admirable.<\/p> <p>All these services enable patients with life-limiting illnesses to access expert help locally.  The North West Hospice serves a population of 110,000.  That is why the project is so vital to the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#D00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.<\/p> <p>Since opening in 1998, the North West Hospice has provided a valuable palliative care inpatient service to the people of counties Sligo and Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan, as the Senator outlined.  While the quality of care provided continues to be excellent, the specialist inpatient unit no longer meets best practice in maintaining the dignity and privacy of patients and their families due to the physical limitations of the facility, especially in relation to space.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, the HSE's palliative care services three-year development framework 2017-2019 informs the development of adult palliative care services in Ireland.  The framework recommended that six existing inpatient units should be redeveloped as all single room patient accommodation to ensure the privacy and dignity of each person and to be in compliance with HIQA standards.  North West Hospice was listed as one of the hospices to be redeveloped.  Against this background, the HSE is continuing to progress plans to develop a new hospice facility on the existing site of the inpatient unit, located on the grounds of Sligo University Hospital.  This will see the inpatient unit increase from the current capacity of eight inpatient beds to 12-bed, single room accommodation.<\/p> <p>The new hospice facility will include accommodation for the community palliative care team, outpatient and consultation facilities, administration and management offices and will have meeting room facilities for HSE and community and volunteer activities that support the delivery of specialist inpatient, community and acute palliative care services.  This will provide for a more efficient delivery of palliative care services throughout the hospice's target region.<\/p> <p>I am advised that HSE estates are managing the capital project on behalf of the hospice to ensure compliance with all relevant HSE protocols and statutory requirements.  I understand that HSE estates has received the stage 2a design report and is currently working to finalise the costs of the new build.  HSE estates is continuing to work closely with the North West Hospice board on the design of the build and has acknowledged the funding commitment given by the board to bring the design and planning application submission to stage 2b.<\/p> <p>When the final design is agreed and costings fully worked out, the planning application will then be submitted to the local authority.  It is estimated that planning permission will be in place by the end of quarter 2, 2020.  The North West Hospice development is included in the HSE's capital plan.<\/p> <p>I want to conclude by acknowledging the commitment of the management and staff of North West Hospice for their continued positive engagement with the HSE during the design and planning process.  More important, I thank them for their valuable work in providing high-quality palliative care to people with life-limiting conditions in the north west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#D00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to everyone who has helped to raise funds for the hospice and I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

I had not been aware that Senator Conway-Walsh was proposing that amendment but I did last week call on the Leader to arrange for further debate on the case of Shane O'Farrell.  I have been supportive of the family, and I know other colleagues in the Chamber, notably Senator Norris, have also been very supportive of the family.  I think there would be great support for Senator Conway-Walsh's proposed amendment and I am happy to second it.  In the D&aacute;il last week, there was significant movement forward on that debate.  It would be useful for us to take a similar approach in the Seanad, in keeping with the approach we have taken before on the issue of Shane's tragic death.<\/p> <p>The recent unfortunate comments by candidates from different parties, although not the Labour Party, in the by-election campaigns in several constituencies &ndash; I am not going to go into them &ndash; exemplify what the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Howlin, has called the toxic discourse that is seeping into public discussion about migrant communities in particular, new communities in Ireland and the nature of inward migration.  It is a really unfortunate development.  It is important that the Government and all public representatives be seen to lead, to take a stance against language that is disrespectful of others, particularly minority communities.  It is important that we show in a concrete and visible way that we are taking a stand against this.  The language we use as public representatives really matters.  There are two ways in which we could move forward on this and I ask the Leader to take these on board.<\/p> <p>First, we need to see the introduction of legislation on hate speech.  The Department of Justice and Equality is conducting a review of the prohibition of incitement to hatred legislation.  That is a very welcome review.  It is due to conclude in December.  We should have a debate early in the new year on the shape of proposed hate speech laws.  There has been a good deal of discussion already about these in this House and the other House but it is long overdue that we reform our incitement to hatred legislation and ensure greater protection for our communities against that sort of hate speech.  Second, and more immediately in the Seanad, we could give Government time to Committee Stage of the Labour Party Bill that would have given rights to undocumented children in Ireland.  We brought that Bill forward this time last year.  It passed Second Stage, despite Government opposition.  It got support across the House, apart from Fine Gael, and it was introduced specifically in response to cases of children who had been living all their lives in Ireland, who had been born here or had come to Ireland as very young children, had all their schooling here yet had no regularised status in Irish law due to long delays in the asylum applications system and other flaws in the system.  It is within the scope of our Oireachtas to legislate to give residency and citizenship rights to such children.  It would be a really positive, concrete step for the Government to be seen to move on this.  I understand the Taoiseach is favourably disposed to some form of regularisation system and I am proud to support the Migrant Rights Centre, which yesterday brought people into Leinster House and brought a letter signed by many people in this situation to the Minister of Justice and Equality.  It is not a huge number of people overall.

I have said on numerous occasions that I believe CHO 8 has the least funding <i>per capita <\/i>for disability services and for CAMHS.  I am concerned that every time there is a difficulty with the budget, disability services are like low-hanging fruit and lose out each time.  I would like the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health to come in here to discuss this.  Part of this discussion could be about the assistant psychologist posts advertised in the past two years, 120 the year before last and again last year, the big recruitment drive, the week-long interview sessions in hotels.  Hundreds of young people were interviewed and I do not know if any of those positions have been filled.

If, as she stated, an emergency appointment for a psychiatric interview is taking 13 weeks, we are not just talking about delays but also about lives.  The HSE is statute-bound to provide psychiatric services, and there comes a point at which it is in breach of its statutory duty.  I think this will end up in the courts in the form of some massive action at some stage.  The problem is that when people, especially young people, take their own lives, there is no financial penalty on the people responsible.  It is very serious.  Children could be denied psychiatric help for 13 weeks when they are in crisis.<\/p> <p>The other matter I wish to speak about is the desirability of asking the Minister of State with responsibility for the Electricity Supply Board, in which I think the State is still a shareholder, to come before the House to explain the reason for the following: when, in the 1960s, the board had destroyed the longest single stretch of Georgian architecture in Dublin by putting up a hideous office block on Fitzwilliam Street, it then had the opportunity to rectify the damage it had done.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, when he was a member of Dublin City Council, had inserted into the city development plan a requirement that any development on that site should involve the reinstatement of the facade.  The board campaigned to change this in order that it could put up another incongruous building on the site.  Now it appears that the board is not even building this building for itself; it is a speculative office development that it is offering to the market to dispose of.  There is no excuse for this.  The opportunity to restore this part of Georgian Dublin was sitting there, and the ESB, in its wisdom, has chosen to ignore that opportunity, to get Dublin City Council to change its development plan to allow it not to restore the damage it did.  Now the board is proposing to sell off the development, once it has it finished, for private office development.  This is a terrible tragedy, and somebody - the shareholder - should take responsibility for what has happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#J00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, to come before the House at some stage for a debate on the issue of housing.  Limerick City and County Council and several other councils are considering a programme that proposes that people, be they widows or widowers living on their own or single people living in three or four-bedroomed houses, be given the option to downsize.  While  some councillors have raised concerns about issues surrounding this, it needs to be examined.  Several people have called to my office expressing interest in downsizing from a three or four-bedroomed house to a smaller, perhaps one or two-bedroomed, bungalow or apartment.

Thousands of families in Donegal are affected by defective mica-affected concrete blocks.  This has devastated them.  We welcome the fact that a scheme administered by Donegal County Council will be operational soon to help the families make their homes safe.  Unlike with the pyrite redress scheme, however, families in Donegal have been required to provide a 10% contribution.  If this involves a complete rebuild, 10% will be a significant amount for families who are paying mortgages on homes that have been destroyed by this blight in our county.  The Mica Action Group has done some excellent work.  It has engaged with financial institutions and has received a fairly positive response to its call for the banks and other financial institutions that hold mortgages on thousands of these homes to make a contribution to help with that 10% and to make the scheme happen.  What is required from Government is for the Minister for Finance to engage with the Central Bank to bring together all the banks and other financial institutions in a cross-lender approach such that everybody is on the same page and the families can be reassured that when the scheme is announced, they will have the financial supports to make their homes safe again.  This would be completely in the interests of the banks and other financial institutions because right now the real value of these properties is rapidly deteriorating.  The homes would be made safe and their value restored to the full market rate, which is what everybody wants.  I ask the Leader to refer this matter to the Minister for Finance today and to ask him to engage urgently with the Central Bank and the financial institutions to get this resolved in order that when the scheme is up and running soon, those supports will be in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#J00400","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>This issue is not exactly on the radar, but a few months ago \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" followed the controversy in the greyhound industry concerning retired greyhounds and the poor welfare of greyhounds.

Today, however, I see that the board is introducing a traceability database, which will cost in excess of &euro;300,000.  I very much welcome this.

Before I invite Senators to contribute, I extend a very warm welcome to the members of Rory&rsquo;s family who are with us - his children, Vincent, Roderick, Mair&eacute;ad and Aileen, with their spouses; his sister, Eileen, and extended family and friends.  Also in attendance are some of his former Oireachtas colleagues and comrades-in-arms - John Cregan, Liam Aylward, Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, Dermot Fitzpatrick, Donie Cassidy, Fiona O'Malley, Geraldine Feeney, Councillor Eamonn Aylward, Deputy Dara Calleary, Mary Cowen who is representing former Taoiseach Brian Cowen and Deputy Michael Collins.  I hope I have not missed anyone.  I add Deputy Barry Cowen and apologise for omitting him.  On behalf of the Members of the Seanad, I again express our sincere sympathy to all those present and hope that, since Rory's unexpected death in June last year, they have been able to come to terms with their very sad loss.<\/p> <p>Rory lived a life which had community and public service at its centre.  To say he was steeped in the GAA and politics is an understatement.  He was first elected to the Seanad in 1977 on the Agriculture Panel.  It began a 30-year career in this House in which he served with great distinction.  He was a hard and constructive worker in the Seanad in which, as in the GAA, he achieved high office.  It was a great honour and privilege for him and his family when he was elected as Cathaoirleach on 12 September 2002.  His wife, Eileen, was present in the Visitors Gallery on that wonderful occasion but predeceased him.  <\/p> <p>Rory represented the Seanad at home and abroad with great honour and respect.  I had the privilege of serving as a Member while he was here.  We were of different political viewpoints, but that did not prevent us from being friends.  At his funeral last year the Cathaoirleach brought to the altar a copy of the Constitution of Ireland as a symbol of Rory&rsquo;s role as Cathaoirleach and Senator.  The Cathaoirleach has asked me to convey to his family his sympathy.  He is heartily saddened that, on doctor&rsquo;s orders, he cannot be here in person on this very important day to pay tribute to his friend.<\/p> <p>Rory began his involvement in the GAA in the 1950s and it continued for over 60 years.  As well as being an accomplished hurler - he won Limerick senior club hurling titles in the 1960s - he was also chairman of the Limerick County Board, a Munster Council delegate and a trustee of the GAA in Croke Park.  He was chairman of the Limerick County Board when Limerick won the all-Ireland hurling final in 1973.  It is a great pity that he was not in Croke Park to witness the Liam McCarthy cup going back to Limerick in 2018.  His spirit must certainly have been in Croke Park on that memorable day in the month of August.<\/p> <p>Rory will be fondly remembered in this House for his warmth, humour and loyalty.  Personally, he was affable and pleasant and a great man to talk politics.  He had some great stories about political life in west Limerick - Members and our guests know much more about it than I do - a most interesting constituency in which to be, but I will not go into them today.  It would be remiss of me, however, not to mention his huge interest in horse racing.  I understand and, in fact, know that he was part of several successful syndicates with other Oireachtas Members and also bred horses on his family farm in Feenagh.  The family farm was a huge part of his life and he never lost interest in or his love for farming.  His heart was always in Feenagh with his family who were central to everything he did.  He was a great character and a great Limerick man.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.<\/p> <p>I call Senator Ned O'Sullivan to lead the tributes from his side of the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#P00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Is on&oacute;ir agus pribhl&eacute;id domsa c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; anseo inniu mar gheall ar &aacute;r sean-chara Rory Kiely.

As the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, his emotion shows the affection in which he held him that the rest of us share.  Rory had friends on all sides of this and the Lower House.  His career in national politics extended over a long period, from 1977 to 2007, during which time he endeared himself to everyone he encountered, from Taoisigh and party leaders to officers and staff of the Oireachtas.  Unfortunately, as I did not arrive in Leinster House as a Member until the year he retired, others are better qualified to recount his achievements in the Oireachtas - they are many - but my own association with him goes back a long time.  I had the pleasure of voting for him in several Seanad campaigns.  He was a regular and very welcome visitor to my home in Listowel where he had numerous friends and acquaintances.  When it was my turn to run for the Seanad in 2007, he supported, advised and encouraged me in every way he could.<\/p> <p>I join the Leas-Chathaoirleach in welcoming Rory's family to the Chamber - his sons, Vincent and Roderick; daughters, Aileen and Mair&eacute;ad; sons and daughters in law; brother in law; nieces and nephews; and, of course, the joy of his life, his many wonderful grandchildren.  His death last year, although not unexpected, was a huge loss to all of them and I know that they are feeling that loss today.  He was a great family man and it is a great pity that he did not get to spend more time in retirement with his beloved wife, Eileen, whom we also remember.<\/p> <p>It is great to see so many of Rory's old colleagues in the Visitors Gallery, each of whom has his or her own story to tell about him.  No doubt, they will re-tell some of them today whenever they get together.  <\/p> <p>Rory was great company.  He was convivial, entertaining and mischievous.  He had a keen political intellect and was a great man at sizing up a situation, spotting a move or getting to the very heart of a matter.  A simple man in many ways, he had no time for posers or high-flyers.  His greatest traits were his loyalty and straightforwardness.  You always knew exactly where he stood and if you were moving in the wrong way, you were told quickly and smartly.  He straightened me out on more than one occasion.<\/p> <p>Rory was a true patriot and gave everything he had to the cause, whether it was his beloved GAA, in which he received the highest honours at national, county and club level; his native parish of Feenagh which was the centre of his universe; or Fianna F&aacute;il, his other great love.  Former Senator John Cregan is in the Visitors Gallery.  I will not mention names, other than to say John chairs the Limerick County Board, a position Rory held with honour.  John will know of all of Rory's achievements at Munster Council and Central Council level and so on.  Rory was known and respected greatly by everyone, high and low, in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, from the cumann member to the county councillor - they were very special to him - to the party leaders with whom he served, each and every one up to its current leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, whom I welcome to the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#P00300","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Mich&eacute;al Martin.

I saw the Leas-Chathaoirleach there.  Rory had a fantastic interest in people and loved to be involved with them.  It was not just for the votes, though we are all guilty of that to some extent.  Rory was genuinely interested in people.  He wanted to know their stories, what they were up to, what was going on with their families, and who was up to what.  This stood to him politically and in all other walks of life.  In his first run for the Seanad, Rory started from a very low base, but picked up transfers from all parties as the day went on and was elected comfortably in the end.  It was that ability to connect with voters, including non-Fianna F&aacute;il supporters, that ensured Rory was re-elected with a plurality in his Seanad elections thereafter.  He was a popular choice for Cathaoirleach when he attained that prestigious position in 2002 - the highest honour to which any Senator can aspire.  Any young politician setting out in this profession could do worse than study Rory Kiely's <i>modus operandi<\/i>and CV.  Even in this era of new politics and fake news, there is no substitute for personality and hard graft.  May it always be so.<\/p><p>I am thinking today, as is the Leas-Chathaoirleach, of our Cathaoirleach, Senator Denis O'Donovan, who was a lifelong friend and companion to Rory.  The Cathaoirleach set this event in motion with Rory's family and I know how much he was looking forward to it.  I spoke with him this morning.

The syndicate had phenomenal success with good horses such as Arctic Copper and Donna's Palm.  I was allowed in towards the end and we had great luck with a horse called Tulsa Jack, which was trained by Noel Meade.  In racing, as in politics, Rory gave it everything.  Tulsa Jack ran one cold wintry day in Downpatrick, which is a long way from Feenagh.  Most of the syndicate cried off and watched it on television but Rory was there leading the horse, and he well into his 80s.  That is the kind of commitment and energy that set him apart.<\/p> <p>Rory was involved in life to the very end.  Not for him were the carpet slippers and the television, apart from \"At the Races\", of course.  I called to see him one evening and could not find a chair to sit on as they were all full of national newspapers, farming journals, racing bulletins, and GAA programmes.  He campaigned for years as a Seanad&oacute;ir to get an elevator for the elderly at Charleville railway station.  He tasked me with completing that job when I was elected, and I am glad to say he and his neighbours got the benefit of that lift in his final years.<\/p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, gu&iacute;m rath D&eacute; ar Rory, Eileen agus ar an gclann Kiely uile.

It was a great honour to have known Rory Kiely.  He was a very affable man and as previous speakers said, he was very loyal to this House and its Members.  He was also very loyal to his party, Fianna F&aacute;il, and was a great loss to it when he passed away.  He liked to travel and often did so.  I knew that well as I was his Leas-Chathaoirleach and had to deputise for him when he was away on his many great missions.  He had a great love for the GAA.  He was chairman of the Limerick county board, a member of the Munster council, a member of the central council of the GAA, and a trustee of the GAA.  Anyone who raised matters relating to the GAA while Rory Kiely was Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann came under the full wrath of the former Senator.  He never allowed GAA issues to be debated in this House.  It may have brought him into contention due to the many All-Ireland tickets he used to get and give out to councillors around the country.<\/p> <p>Rory was a very fair Cathaoirleach and was fair to me as Leas-Chathaoirleach as well.  He was fair to the Members and gave each of them fair time.  All I can say about Rory Kiely is that, based on my observations from serving with him, he was a very fair and loyal man.  One can see that from the many Members of the House who are present today, the many Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the Public Gallery, and the many past Members as well.  In my years in this House, I have never seen as many past and present Members of both Houses attend the expressions of sympathy for any late former Member.  It is great to see Donie Cassidy, Geraldine Feeney, Dermot Fitzpatrick, Fiona O'Malley, Batt O'Keeffe and John Cregan joining us today for the expressions of sympathy for our great friend Rory Kiely.  He was loved by all and always commanded great respect in this House.  He set very high standards, not only for himself but for all Members of this House while he presided as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#Q01100","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Before calling the next speaker, I welcome former Councillor Mattie Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#Q01200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach's tribute was wonderful and emotional.

It is also an opportunity to welcome so many friends.  Of all the tributes paid to former Members over the years, I have never come across so many friends who travelled from all over Ireland to pay tribute to Rory, particularly the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, along with Deputy Barry Cowen and Mary Cowen.  I thank them for coming here.  I wish Brian a speedy recovery.  It is a very nice gesture for her to come today.  <\/p><p>Rory contested the general election in 1969 and entered the Oireachtas in 1977.  He was elected to the 14th Seanad and served here more or less all the time until 2007.  He served as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which was a marvellous achievement at that time.  I had the pleasure of voting for him in the final vote on the day, as I was also a candidate in the election.  Nevertheless when it came to the position, I felt that having served so long himself - almost 24 or 25 years - he would make a very good Cathaoirleach, which he did.  He was born on 1 May 1934.  Senator O'Sullivan and others have outlined what he achieved over his tenure.  <\/p><p>Besides his political career, his GAA career is something that should be recognised.  He has not been recognised for the work he put into the central council of the GAA and the development of Croke Park.  Without his ability and support at that point in time, we would not have the stadium we have today.  That is another major tribute to him.  It is there as a monument to his work as a member of the central council, a trustee and a prominent member of Fianna F&aacute;il.  We were very lucky to have the likes of Rory Kiely diligently working on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il throughout the country and in Limerick and as a Member of this House.  He was a wonderful man who had a wonderful career.  He was a wonderful family man, a great Fianna F&aacute;il man, a great Irishman and a great GAA man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#Q01300","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I also welcome the members of Rory's family, those who served with him and those who serve today in both Houses.  As has been said on numerous occasions, it is a testament to Rory that there is such a great turnout today, the largest I have seen since I entered the House.  Unfortunately, I never served with Rory.  As people know, I only came in here three years ago but I got to know him particularly well through horse racing.  As Senator O'Sullivan mentioned, he was involved in the Royal Alliance Racing Club.  The horse, Tulsa Jack, won the Midlands National on my own track in Kilbeggan, of which I am chairman.  It was on that day that Brian Cowen introduced me to Rory.  I acknowledge Mary Cowen and send my good wishes to Brian.  When Rory heard I was a Senator on the Agricultural Panel, we struck a chord and built a relationship.  Our paths kept crossing on the racetracks of Ireland.  With that in mind, we usually say on days like this that the person we are honouring is probably up there looking down on us but if there is racing on up there at this particular time, I imagine that we are on \"Record\" to be viewed later.  Senator O'Sullivan struck a chord with me when he said that Rory would always take a young politician under his wing and advise him or her.  Based on the relationship I developed with Rory in a short time, I got the impression that I may have been one of these young politicians - young in the political sense, not chronologically.<\/p> <p>I have a share in a horse being trained by Paddy Neville in Rory Kiely country.  We were down there a couple of weeks ago.  I mentioned that there would be tributes to Rory today to a couple of his friends who were talking about him and they said they would like to be here so I extend a special welcome to good friends of Rory - Donie Nestor, Jim Enright and Eamon Leahy - who are here today.  The lads told me some stories.  We all have an impression of Rory being laidback and placid but two of the lads played hurling with and against him and they will tell you he was anything but when he had the cam&aacute;n in his hand.  Donie told me another story that epitomises the Rory that I knew.  He was coming to Dublin with him one day to visit somebody in hospital and they ran out of diesel.  Rory was driving.  Donie started panicking a bit but Rory took out the newspaper and started reading.  Lo and behold, somebody just stopped, which Rory had predicted by laying back.  The person who stopped happened to have diesel in the car.  The colour of the diesel might have been questionable but it did not bother Rory.  The man filled the car with diesel and they continued on their trip.  Donie said that he thanked the man but never got his name but Rory got the registration number of the car and later tracked down the man who owned it and made sure he was looked after.  That says it all about the kind of man Rory was.  His involvement in the GAA has been mentioned a lot.  It would probably be safe to say that Croke Park had Miche&aacute;l O'Hehir and Leinster House had Rory Kiely.

I did not have the pleasure of knowing him well but I had the honour of meeting him on a number of occasions.  I recall very clearly the first occasion.  It was in 2007 when there was an induction for new Seanad Members.  It was our first time in the Members' restaurant and Rory was there with some friends and colleagues.  He had left the Seanad at that stage having carried out the function of Cathaoirleach for the previous term.  I still remember how he went out of his way to welcome me and express warm words of support.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That happened again on a few other occasions when I had the pleasure of meeting him.  He went out of his way to encourage me in what I was doing.<\/p><p>He was the type of politician I can identify with very easily and have a distinct liking for.  Obviously, he came from a rural background, as I also do.  He was rooted in many of the great values and ideals of rural Ireland.  That was in no way a narrow thing.  There was a strong sense of rootedness.  I remember other colleagues in all parties, principally Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, but also in the Labour Party, those people from rural areas who have a certain ethos about what it is to be a community person.  They do not claim to be right on everything, but they know where they stand on issues.  To quote a phrase my father loved, they do not let their feathers go with the wind.  They understand the importance of pragmatism, but know that not everything is for sale.  I greatly admire that breed of politician and Rory Kiely was certainly in that political mould.<\/p><p>It was mentioned that he received a low first preference vote the first time out.  Senator O'Sullivan rightly paid tribute to the ability he showed in being able to attract so many transfers.  That comes from being liked and respected, especially in a Seanad election, it also comes from having the homework well done.  It is not enough to be liked and respected; a person must have the work ethic to succeed in politics.  He always struck me as a quiet and unassuming person, perhaps someone who undersold himself but was very well informed.  When it was his moment to perform, he did very well indeed.<\/p><p>Earlier today I was talking to another Rory, the former Ceann Comhairle and Minister for Health, Rory O'Hanlon, who had great affection for Rory Kiely.  He recalled the positive role Rory Kiely played when they were abroad together on a number of occasions.  I understand the two Rorys led the first Speakers delegation from Ireland to Britain since the foundation of the State.  Rory O'Hanlon, who wishes to be associated with today's tributes, recalled that Rory Kiely was always more than able to hold his own.  He impressed people by his friendship and engagement.  I understand he had a particular friendship and rapport with the then Speaker in Westminster, Michael Martin, funnily enough.  It could be said of Rory Kiely, as it might be said of Michael Martin when compared with successive Speakers in Westminster, that he was more understated in style, but always effective.<\/p><p>Rory's success in travelling around the country and getting elected to the Seanad must be considered in the context of how difficult it must have been to be competing for votes on a panel with people like Francie O'Brien and Paddy McGowan.  He was always well received and he built up his vote steadily as befitted a man of his capacity and capability.<\/p><p>He was a farmer, of course.  He had studied and had a diploma from UCC.  He was not just from and of rural Ireland, but determined to contribute to its advancement.  It was said that he would insist on appropriate conduct here in the Seanad.  I believe a former Clerk of the Seanad gave me to understand that Rory Kiely was responsible for the insertion of the glass panel in front of the Visitors Gallery when somebody in the Gallery was more vocal than they should have been.  He understood the dignity of the Houses of the Oireachtas and acted to protect them.<\/p><p>Drawing again on the words of Rory O'Hanlon, Rory Kiely was a very good ambassador for Ireland as well as a very positive and effective politician in these Houses.  He developed friendships easily and well.  Hopefully now, as we all hope for ourselves, he is developing the greatest friendship of all.

I also welcome his former colleagues.  I know there is great cross-party support in the Gallery.  It is great to see so many people here today to pay tribute to Rory.<\/p> <p>I knew Rory from a very young age as my late father was a city councillor in Limerick.  Even though he was of a different political party, he was a regular caller to my father and was always assured of a preference down the line.  They were great friends over many years through both politics and the GAA.  My father had a public bar in Limerick.  When Rory was in the city, he often came in.  The bar had a manager, Fintan Coleman, who was a South Liberties man.  Rory came in for double abuse because he used to get into battles over both politics and GAA.  They had great banter and I think my father sometimes used to be the referee between the two of them.<\/p> <p>Rory was always a thorough gentleman, a really loyal person and totally sincere.  In 2007, the year Rory retired, when I received my first nomination for the agricultural panel, I remember meeting Rory and he wished me all the best.  He said he hoped he would see me in Seanad &Eacute;ireann one day.  I was unsuccessful then, but I was elected in 2016.<\/p> <p>I have fond memories of meeting Rory at GAA matches and especially Limerick matches.  I know how passionate he was about his own Feenagh-Kilmeedy club and Limerick GAA.  He was a great stalwart up in Croke Park.  When the Limerick club functions took place, Rory would always be there to the forefront.  He was such a pleasure to meet at matches.  He had great knowledge and passion.  Politically we often had discussions when I met him at a funeral or other events.  He was very knowledgeable and a great ambassador not just for Limerick but nationally as well, as has already been mentioned.<\/p> <p>GAA was his first love and he was very dedicated to it.  Senator Paul Daly and others referred to his love of horse racing.  He was an example of a true politician.

Those of us in Fianna F&aacute;il and in politics heard of the legend of Rory Kiely and understood that if we could only have a small bit of his magic, we would indeed go far.<\/p> <p>He lived a life in many arenas, including politics and sport.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said on the passing of Rory Kiely that he was the epitome of a gentleman who was widely respected by people of all political hues in every party.

Many of them have not been back in this House, but came here specially today to be with the family, and to remember Rory Kiely and what he did for the State.<\/p> <p>It was fitting and appropriate that the Cathaoirleach, Senator O'Donovan, was at the funeral to bring forward a copy of the Constitution.  One of the few roles mentioned in the Constitution is that of Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I know Rory was proud to be the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, as were the Senators proud to have him as their Cathaoirleach - a very strict Cathaoirleach who did not allow much latitude especially when it came to the issue of the GAA.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Anybody who mentioned the GAA in any light other than a glowing light in paying tribute to winning teams was not going to get an ounce of latitude.

I got to know Rory very well as he is from Feenagh, and people would know I spent my childhood in Charleville.  We both went to the same secondary school, as did Eamon de Valera, which has been commemorated in the town.  Rory was an institution in his lifetime.  He was universally liked.  I always found him a very deep man, hugely knowledgeable about politics, and he epitomised all that is good about Limerick.  His interests were politics, horse racing and the GAA.  I want to particularly acknowledge the presence of the Limerick county board chairman, John Cregan, who was a near neighbour of Rory's and would have come up through the same channels, and would have gone into the county board position a short time prior to Rory's passing.  The GAA was a great passion with Rory.<\/p> <p>When I met him first, he was a model of brevity and always picked the appropriate words.  I remember he turned to me and said, \"Kieran, remember the power of the transfer.\"  When he first ran for the Seanad, he did very well but to survive initially, he needed the percentages.  Rory was the great artist in that area.  He understood what politics was about.  He was quite sophisticated in his understanding, a great judge of people, passionate about Limerick GAA and, obviously, the fact Limerick won the all-Ireland a short time after his passing clearly meant he was looking down on us.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to be here to pay tribute to Rory.  The fact there is such an enormous turnout is a tribute to him.  I want to take the opportunity to welcome Brian Cowen's wife, Mary, and his brother, Deputy Barry Cowen, and to wish Brian a speedy recovery.  I want to put on record that although Rory was well known outside of Limerick, he was a legend in Limerick itself.  He commanded respect and affection.  Reference was made to Sinn F&eacute;in.

I have been at a number of these tributes since I became a Member of the Seanad in April 2016 and I have never seen so many people, including so many former Members, in the Visitors Gallery, or current Members sitting in the Chamber, of all parties and none.  That reflects the warmth and affection for Rory, who was here for pretty much 30 years straight, perhaps with one tiny blip.  At the same time, the last time he put himself forward to run was in 2002, which is 17 years ago.  There are a lot of people who are not around now who were around then and a lot of people who have come into the system since who would not necessarily have been canvassed by Rory for the Seanad, unlike Senators O'Sullivan, Leyden and Wilson.<\/p> <p>I remember becoming a councillor in 2003 and becoming very aware of Rory quite soon.  Until I came into the Seanad myself, I did not get the opportunity to talk to him all that often.  The first time I had a really good conversation was at a lovely event, the conferring of the honorary doctorate on Brian Cowen by the NUI in June or July 2017.  A number of us, including quite a number who are in the Visitors Gallery, were in the Dame Tavern that evening, and he seemed to know an awful lot more about me than I thought he would.

To be trusted to become a trustee of the largest voluntary organisation in the country by a fair mile is an amazing achievement for anyone, and to simultaneously do that and be Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and be very involved in his family, his farm and horse racing and Limerick generally, is a huge testament to how brilliant a man he was in so many different ways. <\/p> <p>I met him again only a few months later at a sad but joyous event in that we were celebrating the life of the late Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave.

As Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned, he had only been at Se&aacute;n Calleary's funeral the previous week before his very sad and, I suppose, sudden passing, in a way, in that, while he was of a certain age, he was not particularly unwell.<\/p> <p>I was at the funeral.  It was an amazing celebration of his life.  We were in the hotel afterwards and many of the people who are here today were there that day.  He was an amazing politician, an amazing person and an amazing family man.  I would like to acknowledge Deputies Aylward and O'Keeffe and local Deputy Niall Collins, who have joined us in the Chamber.  I will not repeat the names of everyone who has already been mentioned.  Myself and former Senator and Deputy, Fiona O'Malley, soldiered together as local election candidates; she was successful the first time around and I was not.  However, it is great to see Fiona here as well.<\/p> <p>It is a wonderful occasion.  He was a most loyal, affable and genuine individual and a true patriot of Ireland.  I am delighted to have the privilege to be here to offer my small few words to him and to his family.

Senator O'Sullivan summed it up yesterday where he said that sometimes we are our own worst enemies and allow ourselves to be denigrated where people call shame on us and say that we are all the same.  People like Rory came from a background, where he was not a politician but a community man.  He was of his people.  He was a family and sporting man.  He got in here, represented his people and his country through his own personality.  He believed in decorum and he ran this Seanad - no offence to the current Leas-Chathaoirleach - very well.

He was steeped in community and public service.  As has been said here, without being repetitive, he received the position of trustee of the GAA, an organisation that he loved even more than Fianna F&aacute;il, which is saying something.  He and my former colleague from Monaghan, Senator Francis O'Brien, started a tradition of providing endless amounts of tickets for the All-Ireland football and hurling finals to councillors the length and breadth of the country which lasted for three decades.  Unfortunately we inherited their great tradition, but unfortunately we did not inherit the suppliers of the tickets.  Needless to say, in the weeks preceding both All-Ireland finals we think of Rory and Francie in very fond ways.<\/p><p>I was going through the records of the House recently, and looked at the issues that Rory raised.  Like myself, he spoke on very few occasions.  Primarily, the main topics he spoke on were agriculture, fisheries, horse breeding and racing, local government funding and greyhound racing.  These were among a few other issues he raised for unfortunate constituents.  <\/p><p>There are two things that I will never forget about him in his canvassing technique.  First of all, he arrived very late at night, probably 11 p.m. or 12 midnight.  Time meant nothing to him and he would keep one up until 2 a.m or 3 a.m. with stories, etc.  Second, his Christmas card always arrived on Christmas Eve.  I do not know how he managed that but it always arrived then.<\/p><p>Colleagues have alluded to the fact that he was a very strict Cathaoirleach with which I can fully agree.  On 23 March 2005 he suspended me from this House.  I was honoured to be elected in 2002 and to serve with him and it took me some time to get the nerves and confidence built up to speak.  By around 2005 I was getting into my stride.  During a debate on the M50 toll bridge, I was doing very well when I was told that my time was up.  Senator Geraldine Feeney and the late Senator Kieran Phelan were sitting beside me and they encouraged me to keep going and to finish the few words I had to say.  I kept going and Rory said: <\/p><blockquote>Senator Wilson must leave the House.  He is suspended from the service of the Seanad for the remainder of the day.<\/blockquote> <p>That gave my confidence in public speaking a great boost but we remained good friends even after that.  <\/p><p>I want to quote the following and it is relevant to today.  It a small piece from Rory's address to the Seanad on 12 September 2002, after his election as Cathaoirleach:<\/p><blockquote>It is a great honour and privilege to have been elected as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Elections are a healthy sign of democracy.  There are many factors which have culminated in my election today and many to whom I owe my gratitude ...<br \/><br \/>On a more personal note, each of my fellow politicians is aware of the huge burden placed on the home and family life when one is involved in politics.  I have spent many years in politics and the honour bestowed on me today could not have come without the continued and unselfish support and encouragement of my wife, Eileen, and our family.  To each of them I say, &quot;Thank you&quot;.  I am delighted that they sit in the Visitors Gallery today to be part of this wonderful occasion.<br \/><br \/>Since my election in 1977 I have served under nine Cathaoirligh.  Each incumbent had his or her particular style.  However, there is a tradition in the Seanad of co-operation rather than confrontation which has served the Seanad well.  I intend to continue that tradition.  As Cathaoirleach, I will gladly subscribe to any change that will enhance the status of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and allow all Members to make meaningful contributions to the democratic life of the State.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was an honour to serve with Senator Rory Kiely.<\/p><p>On 3 July 2007, his final words in this Chamber were during a debate on the Ethics in Public Office Bill when he asked, \"When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?\"  I have no doubt that in heaven above, when he is taking time out from horseracing, that he is conducting the affairs of this Chamber.

Having said that, I want to focus on two things, namely, a lifetime of service to the common good and to the public good.  Having listened to the comments, I have the impression of a man who was not full of himself and who was, I suspect from what has been said about him, good company.  I am a rural person from west Tipperary and Rory was from Kilmallock in County Limerick, which is not too far away.  I get a sense that he was engaged locally in the community through politics and sport, in particular.  Senators have mentioned his sterling and long-standing commitment to the GAA.  <\/p> <p>Nobody can do those things on their own and that is where family, friends and support come in.  The people who are behind the veil and not in the public space in the same way are the makers or breakers of somebody's public participation.  I say that to underline the part families play very quietly but consistently over the years.<\/p> <p>Rory's period as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad coincided with what was, in many ways, a high-water mark for people with disabilities in Ireland because of two Bills that came through this House at the time.  There was the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the Disability Act 2005.  There is no doubt that Rory Kiely, as Cathaoirleach, had a hand in and an important part to play in ensuring the Acts were well steered through the Upper House.<\/p> <p>I know many of the people in the Visitors Gallery.  A fair few of them were fellow travellers of Rory on the political stage.  That the Visitors Gallery is full is a great tribute to the man.  Not all of those in the Visitors Gallery are from the Fianna Fail family, which says a lot about him.<\/p> <p>Many people do not become household names but are the backbone of political and civil life in this country and in other countries.  Rory Kiely was one of them.  He played an invaluable role in political life and political service.

The tributes paid to him today are well deserved.  The number of former and current Members of the Oireachtas present today speaks volumes about the man Rory Kiely was.  I welcome his family, in particular.  I have been friendly with his son, Vincent, for a long time.  I also had the pleasure of meeting his son-in-law, Gerry, who is a Tipperary man.<\/p> <p>On my own behalf and that of the Fine Gael Party, I welcome Mary Cowen and Deputy Barry Cowen.  I extend our very best wishes to Brian and hope he has a full recovery.  Brian is a very genuine, sincere man and I had the pleasure of serving with him in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>Rory Kiely was a man, as many people have said, who transcended the political divide.  He was an extraordinary character.  He was, as has been said, a Fianna F&aacute;il man, a GAA man and a Limerick man but he was also a man of his community and of his people.  I refer to the magnificent stadium that Croke Park is today, and Senator Leyden is right about that.  Tributes have been paid to many members of the Cabinet at the time, the former Taoiseach and presidents of the GAA but Rory Kiely was a pivotal player in ensuring that the funding was given to Croke Park and that the stadium was built in the way that it was.  I know that from serving with him on Munster's GAA coaching and games development, and being involved as an officer of the Cork county board.<\/p> <p>When one considers Charles J. Kickham's reference to the pride of the parish and pride of place, Rory Kiely comes to mind.  Rory was affable, a gentleman and a rogue.  He was firm, fair and friendly but he was a really good man.<\/p> <p>The former Minister, Batt O'Keeffe, is present.  Many Members and former Members will remember the time when Frank Murphy was the county board secretary in Cork.  Very few people got beyond the hatch in P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh and even fewer got beyond the phone to speak to Frank.  As a former officer, I had the pleasure of working with Mair&eacute;ad and Barbara in the office during the summer.  On one particular evening we had a meeting and a phone call was put through to the office.  Mair&eacute;ad answered and told the caller that she was not sure if Frank was available.  Then Frank walked into the office and Mair&eacute;ad identified the caller as Rory Kiely.  The backroom team was sent away and Frank got on the phone.  A couple of minutes later Frank emerged and he asked me whether I had anything on that evening to which I replied \"No\".  He asked me to take a bundle of tickets to Rory Kiely in Limerick and I was duly dispatched with the tickets.  It was not a small number of tickets, and John Cregan would have been very proud of his ability to get the tickets.  We stopped on the side of the road halfway between Cork and Charleville, just outside Mallow at Newtwopothouse where we met Rory.  He opened the envelope and said that Frank was very generous and he asked me if I would like a ticket.  I said I would and I got a ticket to the Limerick-Wexford All-Ireland Final.<\/p> <p>I will share another GAA memory of Rory Kiely.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will not name the person concerned - Gerry Maguire will understand - but a prominent Cork hurler was in trouble.  I was the chairman of the GAA club in University College Cork at the time.  There was a Munster council hearing and I was dispatched with the player to that meeting.  For some reason, Rory Kiely sometimes called me \"Barry\".  The chairman of the meeting asked if anyone had any knowledge of Mr. Buttimer and the player and Rory said he did not know Barry at all.  The hearing was going badly anyway for the prominent Cork player.  Rory might have had a different idea of a good outcome wearing his Limerick hat, but to be fair to him he winked at me halfway through the hearing and said we would be fine.  He was right and we won our appeal.  Rory Kiely was part of a great triumvirate with Gerald McKenna and Frank Murphy in the GAA.<\/p><p>My other story from the GAA about Rory concerns the time when we were bringing the concept of games development officers and associated bursaries to fruition at third level.  Rory Kiely was an extraordinary supporter of that endeavour.  I recall another meeting that was not going too well and where we were in a bit of bother.  In his calm and understated way, Rory asked a particular question and that allowed me and two other lads to give a speech outlining the virtue of our case.  A vote was subsequently taken and Rory Kiely was the man who swung the vote that day.  <\/p><p>I also have a story about Rory and Frank Murphy.  A Cork candidate was going for a Munster council job.  There was an agreed rota for people to be elected to positions on the council, but this particular Cork candidate was anxious to run for election.  For some reason, Denis Lyons, former Deputy and Minister of State, and I were earmarked to travel with the candidate and we met Rory, who was supporting a different candidate.  We left that meeting, however, thinking that the Cork candidate was getting the vote.  I subsequently met Rory at another Munster council meeting and he remarked that our candidate had not done too well.  I agreed with him and he reminded me that we would have another day.  He was a gentleman.  I had the great pleasure of knowing Rory Kiely from a GAA perspective and I had the great pleasure of watching him in P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh.  He went up and down the stand, where he knew and spoke to everybody.  He had a word for everybody. <\/p><p>Today is a difficult and emotional day for his family, as well as for the members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  Rory was a loyal son, a great father and a great Gael.

I look forward to our discussion on what are two different but hugely important issues.<\/p> <p>I will start with the issue of rail in the greater Dublin area, GDA.  The Government recognises that rail is not just a GDA but a national issue.  Reflecting on that, I will shortly seek Government approval for a &euro;1 billion investment programme in our rail network.  That investment will benefit every part of the network, from Ballina to Dublin to Killarney.  This investment is needed to maintain, renew and improve the network over the next five years and deliver better journey times, improved reliability and continued safety.  This investment is significant and welcome and I look forward to the benefits of this funding over the next five years.<\/p> <p>That investment will complement the construction of the new national train control centre.  It was approved by the Government this summer and I understand construction will start in earnest in the new year.  We all know we need this level of investment.  Passenger numbers are increasing all the time, particularly in the GDA.  The GDA commuter network carries approximately 70% of all passenger journeys on the network every year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the last few years the National Transport Authority, NTA, and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, supported by increased PSO funding, have expanded commuter services across the greater Dublin area.

While these service improvements are obviously welcome, we need to do more.  An important part of that is expanding the fleet.<\/p><p>In the last few weeks the Government approved the purchase of 41 additional railcars for InterCity services, which will add significant capacity on the greater Dublin area rail network.  These 41 additional carriages will increase capacity by approximately 34% on the Kildare, Maynooth and northern lines during morning peak time and will start entering service by late 2021.  I ask the House to allow me to expand a little on how that decision was arrived at.<\/p><p>There are those who say other options should have been pursued or that the chosen option could have been done more cheaply.  Of course, alternative options were considered.  One of those options was to refurbish older rolling stock and bring it back into service but that option simply did not work out.  The initial projected costs were not borne out by the actual tenders received.  I hope the House agrees that, when we talk about spending taxpayers' money, we need to make sure we are making the right call.  I am told that option simply was not the right call.  Along with that option, there was also the proposal to purchase additional carriages for the existing InterCity railcar fleet.  It was decided by the NTA and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann this year to proceed with this proposal and purchase the additional carriages.  Senators will be aware that all expenditure of taxpayers' money must comply with the public spending code.  The proposal to purchase additional carriages was therefore developed into a business case and that business case was submitted to my Department at the end of August.  In line with the public spending code, that business case was evaluated by my Department and, because of the scale of expenditure, it was also evaluated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I assure Senators that there was no undue delay and that I brought the matter to Government in October.  <\/p><p>I have also seen some commentary suggesting that alleged delays caused an increase in the cost.  I do not accept that.  No business case was submitted until late August and, while the total project will cost almost &euro;150 million, the carriages themselves cost just over &euro;100 million, with the remainder of the costs comprising related things like compatibility works, spares, design and VAT.  Therefore, there has been no great shift in the cost of the actual carriages since the proposal was first referenced publicly in late 2016.  I hope that clarifies that particular point. <\/p><p>I assure Senators that I know this purchase is just a short-term measure.  The game-changer for rail in the greater Dublin area is the DART expansion programme.  Next year, I expect to receive a business case in respect of this multi-billion euro investment.  It is a very exciting project which will effectively double the capacity of the greater Dublin area rail network compared with today.  When it is finished, the DART really will serve the entire Dublin area, as its name suggests.  Preparation has already begun.  Earlier this year the NTA and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commenced procurement pre-qualifying for the purchase of a minimum of 300 electric and battery electric trains.  The way the procurement competition will be structured means that number can increase up to 600 carriages if required over the ten years of the procurement framework.  This will provide a flexible and speedy way to ensure that demand can be served by additional fleet if needed.  Senators will appreciate that new rail fleet is not sitting in a showroom somewhere waiting for a new owner to turn up and take it away.  It needs to be built to the specifications of the purchaser and, in our case, to the specifications of our unique rail gauge.  It will therefore take between three and four years after the award of the contract before this new DART fleet starts to arrive.  That does not mean, however, that nothing is being done in the meantime.<\/p><p>As well as the arrival of the 41 additional carriages the year after next, the core city section of the wider city centre resignalling project will be commissioned next year.  When this project is complete, it will significantly increase the capacity of the network through the bottleneck of the loop line bridge across the Liffey.  Next year will also see construction commence on a new station at Pelletstown on the north side, the Kishoge station in west Dublin will open and the station improvement works at Pearse will finish.  <\/p><p>Of course, everything we are doing in terms of improving our rail network in the greater Dublin area is set out in the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, which is a statutory transport plan for the region that, importantly, must be reflected in land-use plans across the greater Dublin area. This type of integrated land-use and transport planning was long sought, was fought hard for, and represents international best practice.  I have no doubt that Senators will have their own views as regards particular projects in the greater Dublin area.  I am happy to inform the House that, towards the end of next year, the NTA will begin a review of the existing transport strategy.  This review will provide an important opportunity to consider whether additional projects above and beyond the extensive measures in the current strategy should be included.  I hope Senators can recognise that there are a number of measures under way over the short, medium and longer term which will improve and enhance rail services across the greater Dublin area.  I look forward to hearing their views later.<\/p><p>I would like to now turn to our second topic and thank Senators for the opportunity to update the House on the sports capital programme.  As Senators will be aware, the sports capital programme is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.  More than 10,000 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998 with the total invested in that period amounting to approximately &euro;1 billion.  Grants under the programme have directly improved sports facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  Before I deal specifically with the latest round of the programme, I would like to take a step back and speak briefly about why we should continue to provide public funding for sports facilities.<\/p><p>It is well established that participation in sport plays a significant role in improving people's health and well-being.  Initiatives that encourage people to exercise regularly can help to reduce the incidence of strokes, cancer and depression, resulting in higher productivity and lower healthcare costs.  With regard to our younger people, the World Health Organization, WHO, regards childhood obesity as one of the most serious global public health challenges for the 21st century.  Childhood obesity has become such a problem in part due to children living increasingly sedentary lifestyles where physical activity has been replaced by watching TV, playing video games and spending time on smartphones.  Accordingly, if we are to compete with these other distractions, we must have good quality, safe and attractive sports facilities. <\/p><p>Similarly, at the top level, we know that sporting success has the ability to lift the spirits of communities, counties and even the whole nation.  Our county GAA stars, our international soccer, rugby and hockey teams, and our Olympians inspire us all.  This high-level success is never achieved overnight, however, and we need to invest in facilities at grassroots level to nurture these talents.  <\/p><p>With these factors in mind, enhanced investment is sports facilities is a key policy objective of the Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I launched the Government's national sports policy last year.  The policy statement sets out our vision for sport in 2027 along with 57 specific actions to transform our sporting landscape.  Increasing participation is a cornerstone of the policy and we have set an ambitious target to have half our adult population regularly participating in sport by 2027.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Furthermore, we want people participating in sport regardless of their background or physical capabilities.  <br\/><br\/>Within the policy statement is a commitment that the Government will continue to invest in sports facilities and central to this objective will be our continued support for the sports capital programme.  The most recent grants under the programme were announced over the last week and represented the final set of allocations under the 2018 round.  The application period closed on Friday, 19 October 2018, and by that deadline a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162 million in funding.  A total of 186 of these applications were for projects deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7 million in allocations to 170 projects were announced on 17 January; 619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8 million were announced in May.  On Friday last, we allocated a total of &euro;37 million to 994 different projects and earlier today we announced further grants totalling &euro;2.58 million to 15 regional sports projects.  <br\/><br\/>I would like to speak briefly about the reforms we have introduced under the two most recent rounds of the programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, and I were determined that the system of applying for grants should be as user-friendly as possible and the methodology for allocating funding fully transparent and fair.  A previous criticism of the programme was the number of applications deemed invalid at assessment stage.  This gave rise to understandable frustration from applicants who had invested significant time and effort in making their applications.  There was also a perception that the whole application process was cumbersome and difficult.  <br\/><br\/>To address these concerns, several improvements have been introduced.  The measures include a significantly shortened application form, more online validation of applications and the hosting of a series of regional seminars for potential applicants.  Importantly, first-time applicants who submitted incorrect documentation under the latest round of the programme were given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment phase.  Some of these measures may have delayed the overall timeframe of the assessment process, but have been very well received by applicants.  <br\/><br\/>The measures to reduce the invalid rate have been overwhelmingly successful.  The proportion of invalid applications fell from one third in previous rounds to one fifth in 2017, and this has been reduced to less than one tenth under the 2018 round.  Ironically this improvement does make the allocation of funding even more challenging as we have even more applications to consider.  I think all Senators will agree, however, that it is the fairest way to treat our applicants and achieve the best overall results. <br\/><br\/>A further improvement we made under the 2017 round of the programme was the introduction of an appeals system for unsuccessful candidates.  This will be continued under the 2018 round and unsuccessful candidates will be contacted shortly with details on how they can appeal the outcome of the assessment process. <br\/><br\/>In regard to individual grant amounts, historically there was no clear documentation showing how individual grants were decided.  For the first time, we published the full scoring system and assessment process for the 2017 round in advance of assessment work commencing and this was again done for the 2018 round.  Every application was then scored using the published criteria which included the likelihood of the project increasing participation, whether the proposed facilities would be shared with other users, the level of socioeconomic disadvantage in the area and the level of funding which the organisation received previously. <br\/><br\/>For the 2018 allocations, the total available funding was first divided by county, based on the<i>per capita<\/i>entitlement and level of demand from that county.  The exact amount allocated to each project was then based on a formula which combined the assessment score obtained, the amount of funding sought and the total amount of funding available for that county.  The scoring system for the 2018 round of the programme was amended to give an even greater weighting towards projects from disadvantaged areas and towards projects that shared the facilities with other users.  The net outcome is that more than 1,600 individual projects benefited under the 2018 round of the programme. <br\/><br\/>While the main field sports such as GAA, soccer and rugby again did very well, any fair analysis will acknowledge the diversity and spread of grants awarded.  Last week's grants alone covered 37 different sports, including boxing, squash, rowing, and athletics to name just a few.  While I believe we have made real progress in terms of improving the overall programme, we must always look to improve further.  With this in mind, I have asked my officials to undertake a full review of the latest round of the programme to suggest any further changes.  This will include an examination of how we might speed up the overall assessment process and whether we can reduce the invalid rate further.  I look forward to hearing any views of Senators in this regard and will be very happy to take on board any suggestions if they meet with approval from the officials. <br\/><br\/>Before concluding I would like to touch briefly on one other significant development regarding Government funding for sports capital projects.  The national sports policy also provided for the establishment of a new large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount available under the sports capital programme.  The new fund is designed to provide a transparent and robust system for funding such projects.  The Government has provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100 million for the period to 2027 for the LSSIF.  The new scheme closed for applications on 17 April, with applications initially confined to local authorities and national governing bodies of sport.  By the closing date, 72 applications were received.  Assessment work is well advanced and it is hoped to make the first allocations in the near future. <br\/><br\/>I hope that I have provided Senators with a good overview of where we are in respect of Government support for sports capital projects.  I believe that Government investment in sport is money well spent and the sports capital programme remains an excellent example of the Government supporting the voluntary sector in a way that benefits entire communities.  While we can always improve matters, I am proud of the reforms we have made in recent years.  Furthermore, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I will continue to make the case for enhanced investment in sport infrastructure in the years ahead to ensure that all of the objectives set out in the national sports policy are met. <br\/><br\/>We look forward to seeing the many projects that recently received funding advancing, but also seeing new applicants being given the opportunity to submit new proposals as soon as possible.  To conclude, I would like to thank Senators for the opportunity to discuss these two very divergent but important areas of my Department's work and I look forward to hearing their views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#W00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Group spokespersons have eight minutes and all other Senators have six minutes.

I am slightly confused about the announcement made about 28 rail carriages.  Initially they were supposed to be renovated but, as he said in his speech, an announcement was made about 41 new carriages which will not come on stream until the year after next.  There was another commitment to leasing 60 to 80 used carriages for delivery in February 2020 at some stage.  I ask the Minister to clarify the different announcements, especially the one about the 60 to 80 carriages.<\/p> <p>As I am sure the Minister knows from his colleagues in Fine Gael who are canvassing in Dublin Mid-West and north Dublin and are speaking to commuters, they are seeing buses driving by them and full Luas carriages.

On top of that, the M50 is in crisis, as are various road networks.<br\/><br\/>As luck would have it, at a meeting of the transport committee this morning we were discussing cycling and cycle lanes.  Under action 97 of the climate action plan, I was asked to raise the commencement of full implementation of the national cycle policy framework.  It refers to local authorities setting out a clear pathway and timetable for the installation of dedicated cycle infrastructure.  I am not just talking about greenways but also about people who want to commute to work using cycling as their mode of transport.  It does not seem to be the case that the money followed the provision in the climate action plan on the national cycle policy framework.  Where are the councils supposed to draw the money from to put in place the infrastructure?  Perhaps the Minister could outline how that will happen.  Perhaps he will refer to the thinking when roads are being designed.  He mentioned an allocation of hundreds of millions of euro or billions of euro for the road network.  This should be compared with the provision for the cycle network.  When designing and upgrading roads, it should be insisted that account be taken of the national cycle policy framework.  That is in regard to the overall transport issue.  It is a question not only of commuters and the road network, which is creaking at the seams, but also of the announcements on the trains, whose provision could be two years away, or more.<br\/><br\/>The Minister referred to the sports capital programme.  While we welcome the ability to appeal and the ability to engage with first-time applicants, I am aware from having been involved in applications that there is an issue with the <i>per capita<\/i>criterion and the arrangement for linking with other organisations when it comes to disadvantage.  The Minister, through his officials, might be able to clarify this.  The <i>per capita<\/i>capacity in a county such as Leitrim is obviously fairly low.  It is welcome that the scoring mechanism is online and no longer very secretive.  Finding out how to get points under the sports capital programme was like trying to decipher the third secret of Fatima.  If an organisation is from a small county or small area and has no other organisation to partner with, its ability to increase its score is limited.  It is up against organisations in the Dublins of this world, which obviously have considerable capacity to partner with other organisations and have a significant <i>per capita<\/i>score.<br\/><br\/>While the Minister outlined the position on rail carriages, there have been other announcements on them.  It is too long for those standing waiting for trains in the commuter belt to wait until 2021.  The same applies to the Luas, buses and cycle network.  Ambition is not being matched to the funding for programmes in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#Y00300","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I thank him for his comprehensive overview.  I want to spend my time discussing sport and the sports capital programme.  Before I do so, I wish to raise the issue of transport and congestion in Dublin.<\/p> <p>I was in London last week.  I had to top up my card and was told that if I travelled after 9.30 a.m., there would be a substantial reduction.  I wondered why we did not have a similar system in Dublin.  There are quite a few people on the platform who opted not to use a train going out before 9.30 a.m.  It does not affect people returning; it only affects people going out.  It is clearly trying to reduce the number of passengers at peak times.  The Luas runs right through the Minister's constituency.  I am very familiar with the DART.  I come in here at 7.30 a.m. but do not take the DART very often because it is physically impossible to get onto it.  One has to push passengers on and off.  Some are left on the platform.  There are many schools along the DART line so the time in question is busy.  Many people travel to work at the time.  Therefore, we have a problem.  I am sure it has occurred to the Minister to ask the transport providers to consider a reduced cost for those using services after 9.30 a.m.  If one takes a DART at 9.30 a.m. or 9.45 a.m., one notes it is half empty, which is great in that it is very pleasurable to travel on.  We need to incentivise people to travel after 9.30 a.m.  I do not believe circumstances are the same for commuters going home because journeys are staggered and they are not competing with schools at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  The Minister might pass that on.<\/p> <p>I want to talk to the Minister about the sports capital grant.  I welcome the announcement thereon.  The Minister has referred to the &euro;37 million.  That is particularly good.  I support all forms of sport and participation.  I was a competitor in hockey, equestrian sport and a number of other sports so I have a keen interest in them.  I will touch on some later.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the substantial grant for Seapoint Rugby Club because I know it well.  The club was successful on this occasion.  I welcome the grant for Avoca Hockey Club, for which I was a very competitive player.  I went to school in the area and was involved there for a long time.  One of my key problems is that I heard about the grants long before Friday.  I had asked in this House about the sports capital grant on numerous occasions.  I had heard anecdotally around this House elements of what was to be announced.  The Minister may call it all speculation.  I take it that it was.  I had heard decisions from political people.  I took the time to Google what was being said in a few of the provincial newspapers, as I do anyway because I am keenly aware of rural communities.  I saw that a number of individuals, from Ministers and Ministers of State to other politicians, had laid claim to fame in respect of the awards and grants.  I am concerned about that.  I am happy to supply some information on this.  We need greater transparency in the process.  I take on board that the Minister is reforming the process.  I am not questioning him personally but believe it is important to have greater transparency in the process and in how we announce grants.  I understand the Minister is in government and that there are pressures on people in Leinster House and all over the place on foot of organisations asking how they have fared.  I have concerns over this.  I took the time to talk to a number of politicians and staff from provincial newspapers, including editors, to ascertain the sort of information the newspapers were being asked to promote in their next editions.  I downloaded a number of responses so I can provide them.<\/p> <p>The Minister knows the sports capital programme is operated by his Department and provides the grants to assist in facilitating sport.  I recognise that.  We do not want circumstances in which there are private tip-offs or in which a politician can in some way enhance his or her political status or have a greater political advantage by knowing information in advance of anybody else.  I have a difficulty with the timing of the announcement and the gap between it and the decisions on the grants, bearing in mind that individuals approached me and that I spoke to a number of individuals in the media who could confirm what I am saying.  When I took the trouble to get the Minister's list &ndash; I had difficulty and had to go searching for it &ndash; I noted the figures were the same, euro for euro in some cases, as those I had to hand.  I flag this as an issue of concern.  We must ensure that there is transparency and accountability and that the whole system is honourable and up front.  It should not be in the gift of any politician or Minister to suggest, by private telephone call or tip-off, that he or she has secured a grant.  Neither the Minister nor anybody else has secured anything.  Grants are secured through the sports capital grant process.  There are validations and processes, as the Minister said.  I agree.  I want to be clear and loud in saying nobody got anything for anyone.  No sports club in this country gained because of any Minister.  It will have gained because it prepared an application, adhered to the criteria and engaged in the proper process.  Nobody should believe he or she got a leg up by anybody in Leinster House for sport.  We need to be clear about that, and we need to be clear about the decisions, announcements and press releases we issue, in respect of which we say we influenced the decision.  We influenced nothing and we should not be influencing anything.  There is something wrong with a system if politicians influence it.  I wanted to flag that issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have been asked by Horse Sports Ireland to bring the following to the Minister's attention.  It has a strategic plan for the period 2019 to 2024, with which the Minister will be familiar.  It may overlap with that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because it involves horses.  It is an impressive plan, with a vision for Irish sport, and I would like the Minister to look at it.  As I say, it may overlap with that of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but I am not 100% sure.  However, Horse Sports Ireland does have a vision and a mission.  It wants to develop a sustainable funding model for its activities and to build organisational capability to enhance the Irish horse sport sector, which is right.  It clearly wants to obtain the support necessary to grow this unique sport and industry, in which the Minister has a keen interest.  I, therefore, ask him to look at it.  <\/p><p>I welcome the statements the Minister has made, but I want to see greater transparency in how the process is completed and brought into the public domain.  The Minister is familiar with Glenalbyn swimming pool because it is located in the heart of his constituency and I know that he is committed to seeing the process through.  I do not know if they come under the sports capital grants programme - the Minister might tell me - but swimming and water sports are critical, whether in the sea at D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour or any other harbour.  I would like the Minister to make some comment on where he sees funding being provided and whether there are resources available within his Department for the pool.  The Minister is on record as being committed to seeing the project delivered in the heart of his constituency, to which I live close.  I would like to leave here today with a little more information, if possible, on what the Minister can do about Glenalbyn swimming pool project and what funding he can provide for it.  There is an expectation that he will be able to deliver on something he has promised for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#Z00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his update.  I note the 16% increase in funding for the Department this year, which is both welcome and necessary.  We have heard all the talk about Brexit, although it has not been mentioned for a couple of weeks because of the moving of the deadline.  Our connections to continental Europe and preparations at ports and so on come under the Minister's Department and are very important.<\/p> <p>The Minister did not mention climate change in his update, but it is another major issue for the transport sector which is the biggest contributor to carbon emissions as the economy grows and expands in the recovery.  Solutions need to be provided and are being prioritised in initiatives such as the roll-out of electric vehicles.  There is a need for considerable investment in the provision of charging systems throughout the country, as well as for public transport.  <\/p> <p>The Minister has outlined many improvements in the Dublin area which I support, but he leaves himself open to the accusation that he speaks about Dublin all the time.  I know that he acknowledged at the beginning of his contribution that rail services needed to be upgraded nationwide, but I would like to hear his comments on, or timelines for, some of the rail services to the regions.  Representatives of the National Transport Authority were in my county of Mayo recently where they addressed councillors.  The Minister mentioned the provision of 41 carriages, none of which will be used on the Westport line until 2022.  Perhaps he can give me some updated news in that regard.  There is an appetite to use more public transport services because of the acceptance of climate change.  The number of passengers on the Westport line increased from 535,000 to 580,000 in 2018.  There is an acceptance of the need to use public transport and there is demand for it, but we will be playing catch-up if we are not going to have extra carriages until 2022.  There has been a change in the mood of the public and attitudes to climate change and the use of public transport.  If we are to take advantage of it, we need to be doing more to get ahead of the curve, which is important.<\/p> <p>I welcome the &euro;22 million investment announced in the budget in the regional airports programme because regional airports are crucial to the economies of the regions, industry, job creation and tourism.  I am conscious of this because I live within 15 miles of Ireland West Airport Knock which upgraded its main runway recently at the cost of &euro;11 million.  That is most welcome and an example of balanced development.  Tourists need direct access to the regions to explore the Wild Atlantic Way and the Hidden Heartlands, as well as to take advantage of the value for money available in the regions that is not available in urban areas, Dublin in particular, because of the significant rise in the cost of hotel accommodation.<\/p> <p>The Government increased the level of investment in sport and for the first time published the policy last year, which was welcome.  The programme for Government pledges to double spending in sport in the next ten years, which is also welcome.  In the same way that the use of public transport assists in dealing with climate change, investment in sport helps to keep the nation healthy, which is important.  There have been many good stories in sport in recent times.  I commend the Minister for the development of the campus at Abbotstown to such a high standard.  It has been one of the good news stories, the jewel in the crown, as it were, for our elite athletes.  The sport capital funding about which the Minister has talked is being used to provide facilities to increase the level of participation, at whatever level people are, throughout the country.  In urban areas, in particular, there is a big demand for facilities.  I met one of the officers of Cuala GAA Club in Dublin which fields 100 teams at all levels and owns nothing other than its clubhouse.  It has leases with the local authority and so on.  That will an issue for policy down the line, but we certainly have the opposite problem in rural areas where we have the facilities but not the numbers.  That is an issue, of which I am conscious in the GAA, but I am sure it extends across all of the major team sports, including soccer and rugby<\/p> <p>There are challenges in sport that the Minister has not mentioned.  Like Senator Mark Daly, I attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Transport and Sport this morning.  We have all heard about the challenges facing the FAI.  The Minister has been very involved in dealing with them, but the reports have been slow, frustrating and painstaking.  We all thought representatives from the FAI were to come before the committee in September, but they have not yet come before it.  It is ready to receive representatives of the FAI and Sport Ireland to discuss their findings.  The victims are the coaches who experienced the withdrawal of funding for programmes.  I support what the Minister did in that regard, but the longer this goes on, the closer it gets to becoming impossible to restore funding until we are sure about the governance of the FAI.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John O'Mahony:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What is the implication for Government support for the European Championships next year, for example?  <\/p><p>The budget allocation included &euro;103 million for maritime safety initiatives to ensure the Irish Coast Guard can operate safely and effectively and, according to the Budget Statement, \"Key priorities here will be to increase investment in safety-related training.\"  Let us contrast that with the announcement last weekend, unless I need to be corrected, where the Coast Guard has withdrawn over an issue relating to safety equipment.  Will the Minister clarify this or will the funding go some way towards solving that problem? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#AA00200","speaker":"1426","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I am grateful to address the issues of transport and sport.  They seem unrelated, except that they share a Minister, but both need to be got right to protect our future, especially our health, social well-being and cohesion.  On transport, the Minister has to admit that he is losing the battle against congestion in Dublin, as colleagues have noted.  It is a nightmare for tens of thousands of commuters every morning, ourselves included, who simply need to get to work.  There are plans, but they are for the future and I do not believe they are ambitious enough to allow us to catch up with other cities, never mind start to win our own battles.  We need to cut through the spin.  For example, at budget time, the Minister announced an additional &euro;384 million for his Department.  This figure is deeply deceptive.  The vast majority of this or &euro;357 million is to implement the national development plan, and this was cut because of the overspend on the children's hospital.  That leaves only &euro;27 million extra in current spending.  The Minister announced &euro;40 million for tourism, not linked to a no-deal Brexit.  This leaves open the question as to how additional spending of &euro;40 million can be accommodated in a &euro;27 million budget.  It is likely there are cuts hidden in the small print.  All this means more congestion and even more stretched rural services for people throughout the State.<\/p> <p>The Minister had little to say on the need for all-Ireland transport.  A &euro;60 million investment would mean four trains an hour between our two largest cities.  Would not that be truly great, with a massive economic benefit, including on tourism, were it to come to pass?  There is increasing demand for rail along the eastern corridor.<\/p> <p>The big picture must be a plan to achieve free and efficient public transport.  That is how we beat congestion, reduce emissions and make getting to work bearable for staff.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports starting with under 18s so that the culture of public transport and demand is instilled in our youngest.  I could list a bunch of roads we need or refer to airports for all but we have to shift our thinking towards free public, clean transport in urban and rural Ireland.  I have seen a document released under freedom of information in which the Minister's advisers rubbished the Government's &euro;1 million electric cars promise.  It is pure pluck-a-figure politics and will not be delivered. <\/p> <p>We must cut through more spin on sport.  Many a Fine Gael Deputy and Senator was cock-a-hoop to announce, prior to any press release, details of the sports capital programme grants last week.  I wonder how many of them know they were the 2018 allocations being paid out in budget 2020.  This should be an annual, regularly paid, transparent process, not an overdue grant about which Fine Gael likes to tip off its local clubs, and gets to feature in its election literature.  <\/p> <p>I cannot discuss sport in Ireland without mentioning the need for and a growing demand for an all-Ireland sports structure across the board.  From soccer to athletics to mixed martial arts, there is, bubbling under the surface, a people-led movement for all-Ireland sports teams and competitions, as it is proven both parts of the island work best and achieve more when they work together.  <\/p> <p>Fundamentally, investment is way behind other countries and the Government has no intention of catching up.  Members will recall a recent briefing by our Olympic rowers who were paying for much of their own training themselves.  That sums up the approach to sport.  If they deliver Olympic medals, they are bound to have a Minister crawling up their backs, sometimes quite literally, but until then, they are on their own.  That culture has to change.  We must put our money where our mouth is if we want success and all the positive health, including mental health, and social benefits that go with a healthy sporting culture.  <\/p> <p>Last week, there was a press report of remarks by the chairman of Tourism NI who spoke positively of the growing rationale for linking Ireland's Ancient East with the Wild Atlantic Way via the Causeway Coast.  It would be encouraging to hear the Minister's perspective on that.  It has obvious tourism, economic and transport benefits.  Now that Tourism NI and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are out of the traps, it is incumbent on him to encourage and foster that engagement and show his support publicly, and to initiate a process that considers economic research into the benefits of this.  It makes sense from an economic, logistical and tourism perspective.  It defies logic that Ireland's Ancient East stops where it does and does not continue into Downpatrick, the heartland of C&uacute;chulainn and connect all the way up to Fionn Mac Cumhaill and the Causeway Coast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#BB00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss rail transport in Dublin and sports.  It would be wrong not to acknowledge the deep interest he has taken in people with disabilities in his multiple briefs.  He has engaged directly with people with disabilities and the representative organisations.  At the end of last year, the Joint Committee on Transport Tourism and Sport produced an excellent report and the Minister has begun to honour his commitment to meet that committee and provide updates on a six-monthly basis.  He made sure that people with disabilities have been appointed to each of the public transport authorities.<\/p><p>I now raise an issue that I have previously made him aware of.  I still have little confidence in the NTA, which is shared by many with disabilities, on its commitment to transport for all.  I may be paranoid but a leaflet on BusConnects came through my letterbox recently.  I do not see any symbol or reference to people with disabilities in the document, which sets out the revised plan.  The front of the leaflet has four people of working age, two females and two males.  It talks about the service being for the future.  My open question to the NTA is: is it concerned about the future of people with disabilities and mobility impairments in respect of its brief?  I could recite many examples, and the Minister will be aware of them, but I wish to keep this on the agenda.  <\/p><p>In his opening remarks the Minister stated:<\/p><blockquote>The game-changer for rail in the greater Dublin area is the DART expansion programme.  Next year, I expect to receive a business case in respect of this multi-billion euro investment.  It is a very exciting project which will effectively double the capacity of the greater Dublin area rail network compared with today.  When it is finished, the DART really will serve the entire Dublin area, as its name suggests.  <\/blockquote> <p>Perhaps I am being particular but I am concerned about whether it will serve the entire Dublin population and the people who travel around the city who have disabilities and mobility impairments?  That is our challenge.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While I acknowledge the Government has committed to so doing, in light of what I have said about the National Transport Authority, NTA, it is important that we underline and take that issue more strongly on board.<\/p><p>With reference to childhood obesity and health, sport has had a huge part to play for people with disabilities going back to the late 1950s and 1960s when Ireland participated in the first paraplegic Olympics to run in parallel with the regular Olympics in Rome in 1960.  The purpose of accessible public transport is to get people somewhere and that includes to sporting events, as spectators and increasingly as participants.  I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say about making sure that facilities are improved for people with disabilities to be able to participate actively in sport.  People with disabilities have to go through really hard-knuckle rehabilitation in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other places but sport too is rehabilitative and copper-fastens people's participation in a community.  It has its own important part to play.  Transport can make sure a person gets there or does not get there.<\/p><p>Following the lead this Minister has given, to use a sporting analogy, the ball is at the toe of many other Ministers to make sure that if people can use public transport, there is somewhere they can go and participate.  The Minister has met Padraic Moran, a wheelchair user, on several occasions when he was a witness at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He is a young man who, unusually for people with disabilities, has employment, and he lives in Bray.  He has had episodic problems using the DART, and problems with the maintenance of his wheelchair, which go back to the health services.  He is an international sportsman and has represented Ireland playing boccia.  The connections between sport and transport are critical issues for people with disabilities and to help us implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  What is the Minister's ambition for the next 12 months for people with disabilities?  Senator O'Mahony talked about doubling spending in sport over the next decade.  What does the Minister intend that to be like for people with disabilities? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#BB00300","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for all his notices and notifications about transport in Dublin.  There is a bit of a mix-up because the Seanad schedule listed statements on transport and sport in general.  While I welcome the announcements for Dublin, the extra train carriages and high-speed trains to connect Dublin with the regions, I will raise issues that I have raised in the past with the Minister.<\/p> <p>On 2 July, we had a debate here on the Limerick-Shannon metro link.  I was informed then that there would be public consultation in the latter part of this year.  On 7 November, I contacted the NTA to find out where that update was and was told that the consultation would not take place until the first quarter of 2020.  It is really disappointing to find that while there have been announcements about transport for Dublin and Cork, there have been none for Limerick as the third largest city.  I know the Minister's commitment because he has been down to visit the area and was recently in Shannon Airport.  Much good is happening in the transport sector and in respect of Bus Connects in Dublin but is that what is holding up the announcements for the rest of the country?  We have to have balanced regional development.  The Government's announcements refer to that and that is part of the Ireland 2040 plan.  I am really concerned that there have been no announcements about the connectivity between Shannon Airport and Limerick, which has the second largest deepwater port in the country.  While I know the Minister might not be able to answer me today he might be able to give me some suggestions about what is happening there. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#CC00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Can I interject briefly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#CC00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#CC00400","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The Minister has just clarified with me that his brief was quite narrow when he was asked to come here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#CC00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>That is why I said there might have been a mix-up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#CC00600","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I just want to clarify it, and I will allow the Senator back in then.

Obviously, it may have happened because he is the Minister with responsibility for transport and sport but today's debate was never intended to be a discussion of transport and sport in general.

Nobody told him.<\/p> <p>The Minister knows my feelings about the Limerick-Shannon metro link and how important it is to the development of the region.  Senator O'Mahony referred to the regional airports budget announced recently.  I know from the Minister's recent visit to Shannon that he realises the importance of Shannon Airport.  I will keep putting this on the agenda.  While Shannon has autonomy and is set up slightly differently from other airports, I welcome the fact that extra routes have been announced recently and acknowledge the work the board is doing there to try to bring extra business to the airport.  Many companies are considering expansion and when they created extra jobs recently they announced that Shannon Airport is the airport for the region and having the airport and the port on their doorstep helped them make up their mind to locate in the mid-west.  That is why I would really like to see something happening with Shannon.  While I acknowledge that the Minister said he would talk to the different tourism groups to see if they can work with the board, I will keep this at the top of the agenda, if that is okay. <\/p> <p>I acknowledge the recent announcements about the many successful clubs that received money under the sports capital programme.  Sports clubs are the heart of all communities.  There are so many in rural and urban communities and they help children to have a very healthy lifestyle, as the Minister himself has noted.  It is very important to keep supporting these sports clubs because many of them find it hard to get money for club or pitch development.  I thank the Minister for the work he has done.  I know there is an appeals process for clubs that have not been successful.  I acknowledge the support clubs receive from the staff in the Department who help them with their applications and who point out where they have gone wrong and help them in the appeals process.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maria Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is to be commended and shows an acknowledgement that sports clubs are needed and wanted and being supported by the Government.

The section on transport was several pages long.  He came to the House to speak about transport, but his statement included three pages about sports capital grants.  Any blame for the opening of a Pandora's box can be laid fairly at his feet, as I am sure he will accept.<\/p> <p>I refer to the Minister's comment on the purchase of 41 rail carriages.  I accept what he laid out.  However, one of the delays was caused in going to tender for the purchase of second-hand carriages.  Anyone who has any interest in transport knows that there is a particular gauge in use in Ireland and that the likelihood of finding second-hand carriages anywhere else in the world is very slim.  I understand that only in Brazil and one territory in Australia is there a similar gauge in use and that rail carriages are in short supply in both countries.  They will hardly have workable carriages available to sell to Ireland.  The Minister might expand on why a tender was issued for second-hand rail carriages when even the smallest amount of research would have shown that they would not be available.  That contributed to the delay and, possibly, the final cost of the carriages.  I understand the cost is &euro;150 million, but at one stage it could have risen to &euro;160 million.  It is to be hoped the final cost will be a little lower.<\/p> <p>I will not apologise for speaking about rail services in the capital city where and greater Dublin area whre over one third of the population lives and just under 70% of all tax revenue is generated.  We have to make sure the capital city works and that the city in which the highest tax revenues are generated for the State is protected.  I am always sorry when I hear Fine Gael Members ask why the situation in Dublin is being discussed.  The greater Dublin area is the economic engine of the country.  It is welcome that the Minister is taking a particular interest in making sure this economic engine will continue to run.  In this House I have always stood in social solidarity with those living in other regions which should receive investment.  Fine Gael and, to some extent, Fianna F&aacute;il, constantly criticise people for mentioning Dublinm, but I will not criticise the Minister for doing so.  That is the reason he was called to the House today.  <\/p> <p>The Minister laid out the investment plan for the greater Dublin area.  It provides for investment in rail services and the provision of extra electric engines, carriages, etc.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Senator referred to profiling and overspending in other areas.  I am concerned about whether the profiling of spending in the greater Dublin area in terms of investment in rail services will change owing to overspending in other Departments, as well as the Minister's.  Some time ago I carried out a quick analysis of all of the road announcements made by the Minister, from County Mayo to Macroom, Dunsink and so on.  On average, the figures are running at approximately 34% above the original estimated costs.  That will create a &euro;700 million hole in the Department's budget.  Some call it profiling, but will there be delays because of the overruns on several projects?  Will they be re-profiled, delayed or cut?  Has any work taken place in the Department to assess the impact of overspending inside and outside the Department?  Construction inflation happens, as I am sure the Minister is aware.  When he was in this House and in the Lower House he was quite scathing of the Government when there was an overspend or an increase in spending, but there is construction inflation.  Let us see how it impacts on the overall spend.  The Minister can explain the figures.  <\/p> <p>I hope the Minister will forgive me for asking some questions not directly related to his brief.  Kids Go Free was a campaign run by the NTA during the summer to promote use of the leap card system.  The campaign was very effective and educated people on the benefits of moving to public transport.  It is too late to have another scheme this year, but I ask the Minister to explore the idea that children should be able to travel for free during the Christmas period in the main urban centres.  This would help to create an ethos of using public transport at an early stage in children's lives.<\/p> <p>I refer to the DART line.  About a month ago I spoke to a young woman who had lost consciousness while travelling on the line near Blackrock, but because of the crush of bodies she did not hit the floor of the train until it had reached Grand Canal Dock station.  She was complimentary about the staff and passengers who had been around her, but it is frightening that somebody can pass out owing to overcrowding on the DART.  I know that the NTA has done some work to try to encourage students to travel at alternative times on the DART and the Luas, but the introduction of a financial incentive to travel outside rush hour should be considered in the short term.  This is a short-term problem which will take time to solve. <\/p> <p>In a report in a newspaper the Minister may have been quoted incorrectly where it referred to the enforcement of the law in bus lanes in order to make maximum use of bus services and corridors.  The report stated the Minister was not open to the idea of enforcement through the use of cameras and transferring responsibility for it to the NTA.  He might avail of the opportunity to clarify the matter.  I do not think having a garda stand in a bus corridor to make sure cars are not travelling in it is the best use of his or her time.<\/p> <p>I have a plea to make to the Minister.  I know that the matter is not within his remit, but perhaps he might use his good offices to make some progress in reintroducing for the Christmas period Operation Freeflow in the main cities, including Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, using garda&iacute; on probation from the Garda College in Templemore.  It would help to encourage more people to visit these cities.  Operation Freeflow was last used in the 1990s when it was very successful.  People on the roads today know how difficult it is to move around cities.  I have noted the number of cars which move into bus lanes which affects not only the flow of buses but also cyclists who are put in danger.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue.  I know from speaking to him that he may have been misquoted in the report in the newspaper and hope he will clarify the position today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#DD00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I owe the Minister and Senator Humphreys an apology.

There are many areas across the globe where we punch above our weight and sport is certainly one of them, from hockey and rowing to horse racing, boxing, rugby, golf and soccer.  There are incredibly talented people in Ireland, and each and every one of them should be admired.  Nevertheless, we need to do more to support our young, female or vulnerable athletes, as well as those who would be athletes if they had the means, those who define our wonderful, multicultural society today and those stars struggling for support.  I welcome the national broadcasting pledge to increase coverage of women's sport.  If young girls cannot see women succeeding, it will be much more difficult for them to dream they can do it too.  We need to play our part in that regard and I ask the Minister to consider ways to subsidise girls' clubs to attend women's events.  Let us pack those stadium stands, irrespective of people's ability to afford tickets.  I say the same for juvenile sports and their teams.  When the hard work is going on, we should not just celebrate events, but also examine ways to encourage children to participate in sport and to enjoy it because sport is an enjoyable adventure.  It was heartbreaking to read the following in the <i>Limerick Leader,<\/i>written by a 13 year old boy who had given up the sport he loved - hurling - because he was never given game time:<\/p><blockquote>The coaches didn&rsquo;t care about my feelings, they only wanted to win at all costs.  Even now I find it very hard to trust adults.  I was completely isolated at a sport I love.  I can honestly say, I have been affected by what I had to go through at a very young age.  There is so much sadness in life but playing sport should not be a sad experience.<\/blockquote> <p>I read that and thought it was very sad.<\/p><p>Sports capital grants are a lifeblood for clubs and organisations throughout the country and I have worked on quite a few with many volunteers in Carlow.  It would be great if we tied some of the funding to the fair play rules, or gave more to clubs that give more to their child members, female members and the most vulnerable.  We need to consider the most vulnerable.  I was delighted with the sports capital grants.  I acknowledge that some people were disappointed, including some clubs that contacted me.  Some clubs did not receive as much funding as they deserved, and I have an issue with a few of them, which I will appeal, but other clubs were delighted.  Overall, I welcome the grants.<\/p><p>There are many concerns about public transport.  I understood that Kilkenny was meant to receive a town bus link, for which everything was ready to go.  There were four buses and two routes but that is now on hold.  It was meant to start in the next few weeks or perhaps in a month or two but today, when I was travelling to the House, I learned that it is on hold, which upset me.  Carlow's town bus link is also on hold, which concerns me.  I am constantly disappointed when I leave Carlow town on any slip road to a motorway and see cars and vans chock-a-block for the day while the owners carpool to Dublin for work.  While such people are being environmentally friendly in their decision to carpool, many of them will have returned from working in New York, where the carpool system works, in one of the most densely populated areas in the world.  The carpool system can work.  We need to have lanes specifically for carpool vehicles in order that commuters can share their cars when they go to Dublin.  I speak about Dublin because everything seems to centre on it, but I always have to ensure I represent rural Ireland, as I do.  The more people who are encouraged to carpool, the fewer cars there will be on the road, which will mean less traffic for everyone and reduced carbon emissions.  However, this type of pseudo-public transport is wrong because people have no other choice.  We have no reliable, decent public transport in rural Ireland.  While there may be trains, buses and, in some parts of the country, boats and aeroplanes, the only place where there is reliable and fit-for-purpose public transport, with all forms joined up together, is in our capital city.<\/p><p>Recently, we as a nation watched, horrified, as RT&Eacute; highlighted chronic overcrowding on Irish Rail services throughout the country.  As any commuter, tourist or rail user will agree, however, the problem is not new.  Customers pay for transport services they do not receive.  I have been contacted by a number of my constituents who use the Waterford-Dublin line and have been unable at any time to access seats for their journey.  When an Irish Rail ticket is issued, it is not designated as standing or sitting.  The expectation is that there will be a seat on board.  If there is not a seat, there should be a reduced ticket price for those standing.  It is common for lights indicating reserved seats to be turned off when the train is about to depart.  Those queuing to board may not be able to access their reserved seat but when they eventually reach it, they may have to argue with a rail user who sat in the seat when the light turned off.<\/p><p>Seating reservations cost money and, therefore, should be guaranteed.  Otherwise, customers' rights are being infringed.  I have been told of passengers sitting on toilets, in wheelchair bays, in baggage units and on the floor which is wholly unacceptable.  Although I requested the Minister's attention on the matter, I have been advised that such transport operational issues are outside his remit.  Irish Rail's passenger charter states, &quot;We do our best to ensure our stations and trains are safe, clean, and comfortable and have the appropriate facilities for you to enjoy your journey.&quot;  This is not currently the customer experience.  There is a serious issue with both health and safety and customers' rights on Irish Rail.  I ask the Minister to examine this serious issue.  It constantly arises.  We have sought additional carriages for the Waterford-Dublin trains, which pass through Carlow.  We were told months ago we would get them but they have not arrived and it is becoming a serious health and safety issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#EE00100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I hope he will be able to visit Kildare for the official opening of the Sallins bypass, a project about which I spoke to a couple of his predecessors, namely, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I would be delighted to welcome the Minister, Deputy Ross, to the opening of the bypass.  It will almost coincide with the recent opening of three additional lanes on the old Naas bypass.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor in respect of carpooling.  Those of us of a certain vintage will remember the case of Boston.  A lane into Boston was designated specifically for carpoolers.  It would be easy to take such a measure.  Carpool lanes need to be combined with bus lanes, which both carpoolers and buses could use.  The facilities are there but the problem is the NTA cannot envisage anything else but cars on the road.  Its public transport remit has fallen down in this regard.  I have spoken and written to it on a number of occasions, identifying potential park-and-ride areas such as lands that adjoin interchanges, which could easily be turned into park-and-ride facilities.  The agency has indicated to me that providing a park-and-ride facility would be a waste of time because it is quicker to go to Dublin by car than by bus.  Such a response should not come from the NTA.  It should encourage more people to take public transport.  I hope that when the plans are drawn up for the N4, to widen the Maynooth road, it will encompass a bus lane that can be used for carpoolers.  It has been done in Belfast, where there is a lane on the N1, which goes into the city.<\/p> <p>I turn to the issue of traffic into Dublin in the morning.  Everyone complained about the N7 before the third lane was opened, and now it is almost like a car park.  It requires just one person to brake and, suddenly, there will be a concertina effect all the way down the road.  The Minister might communicate with the NTA in respect of the introduction of speed restrictions - perhaps 80 km\/h - at certain times, such as peak traffic times in the morning.  It would reduce the level of congestion that occurs on the N7 and N4.  I hope there will be further planning for a new train station in Sallins.  The train station is currently located in the middle of the village but there are parking restrictions, leading to people parking in the housing estates around the station.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Anthony Lawlor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The development of a new train station with a large car parking facility would be beneficial, particularly with electrification to Hazelhatch and the possibility of development further to Kildare.<\/p><p>I welcome last week's announcement on the sports capital process.

It is incredible that we have cycle lanes that go a couple of hundred yards and then disappear.  There are cycle lanes along the quays, for example, that we share with bus lanes while cars fly past in the right-hand lane.  People have discussed transport in Dublin and in fairness, the Minister has extended the length of the Luas lines and is improving the DART.  The time has come to put a congestion charge in Dublin and remove as much traffic as we can from the streets in Dublin.  Public transport is very good in this city.<\/p> <p>When we get past Westland Row, there is a contraflow cycle lane so cyclists can get to City Quay.  There is a cycle lane on City Quay that is fantastic.  As a novice cyclist I felt so safe there.  I was well away from the traffic and it is a great piece of work.  There is an opportunity to put a cycle lane from Blackrock, for example, or D&uacute;n Laoghaire straight to the city centre.  We can do so much for cycling around this city.  I never knew or thought about it until I was on a bicycle - and commercial drivers, bus and taxi drivers tend to be more sympathetic - but when a cyclist is at traffic lights which turn green, for some reason or other people in cars feel they need to compete with the cyclist in taking off.  Will the Minister consider exploring if we can put in a secondary signal that would turn green for cyclists and allow them to take off with safety perhaps a minute before the lights turn green for cars?  It would help safe cycling around the city.  I also have difficulty with delivery vans parked in cycle lanes.  The local authority has put in a cycle lane along Dame Street but as one cycles there, one finds trucks parked on the left and any cyclist must move to the carriageway, competing with cars in order to pass those trucks.  I do not know how we can get over this other than to have deliveries between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. or something like that.<\/p> <p>I compliment the Minister on the rules recently introduced, although when I initially heard them I was a bit horrified that a driver had to be a certain distance from a cyclist when overtaking.  Having climbed on a bicycle, I can see the need for it.  As a cyclist, one needs to feel that the cars will not come right alongside.  We cycled up Kildare Street the other day and a van came up behind us with the driver revving the engine no end.  He could not have passed us if he wanted to because the road is narrow enough and it is divided because a contraflow lane is in operation for buses.  This guy constantly revved his truck in trying to intimidate us so we would stop cycling, get off the bike and get on the footpath so he could pass.  Cyclists suffer much travelling around the city.  I am no cheerleader for them and they have enough cheerleaders.  Some of the people who speak for cyclists need to cop themselves on and try to do it in a more controlled way.<\/p> <p>Looking at the city in mornings from approximately 7.30 a.m. until 9.30 a.m., there are thousands of bicycles coming through every day.  The bicycle renting system in the city allows people to get across the city very easily.  I compliment the Department, which has put many initiatives in place or facilitated local authorities in putting them in place.  Today we heard that a small number of people in the Department are dedicated to cycling so I wonder if we could get a couple of really proactive people involved who could get out on a bicycle and note the position for cyclists around the town.  When one gets to the contraflow lane beyond Pearse Street station on Westland Row and towards City Quay, there is a nice cycle lane but it ends suddenly.  Crossing O'Connell Street bridge and heading down the quays, there is a cycle lane for approximately 100 yards and then it is gone.  The rest is a joint bus and cycle lane, and it is certainly not the best way to do things.<\/p> <p>We need to sit down and look at bicycles as a mode of transport.  They are clean and healthy.  I am thinking of taking up cycling a little more and I have undertaken to cycle in Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, although I have some reservations about doing it in Cork because of the number of hills.  We need officials to go out there and see what is going on.  Will the Minister consider how to support cyclists in the city to make a cleaner, greener and safer environment for all of us?  I know the Minister is always keen to engage with people and there was engagement today in a committee with cycling advocates, including representatives of I BIKE Dublin.  Perhaps officials will sit down with a small group of advocates who are calm and who have reasonable arguments to make and listen to them in order to see how we might improve things.  I appreciate that local authorities have a role in this also and I ask those authorities to do something similar.  If they listen to what people need, we can see what we can provide for them.  There is some great work being done around the place.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#FF01400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister who s consistent in his approach.

I challenge Members to outline the criteria and weightings included in the application form.  I ask the Minister to review the criteria because we have a flawed system for the way funding is allocated under the programme.  In saying that I am not casting aspersions on the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin.  I welcome the allocations made last week, on which I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State, but we should examine the criteria and weightings outlined.  Increasing participation in sport has been given a weighting of three.  Level of disadvantage has been given a weighting of seven based on the Pobal index, but what happens where a club is not included in a Pobal area?  What happens where clubs have received funding previously?  The sharing of facilities has been given a weighting of five and technical merits, a weighting of three, which is wrong.  It should be about more than that because the Minister is offering the grant based on the merits of the application made.  Level of funding has been given a weighting of one, with a minimum figure of 20% being set for the club.<\/p> <p>I welcome the investment made by the Minister's Department in infrastructure in the city and county of Cork, in particular.  I want to speak about the Cork transport strategy which was published last May.  It is an ambitious plan for the city and county of Cork,  in particular the metropolitan area of Cork city.  It is about accessibility, integrating public transport services, walking and cycling infrastructure.  I ask the Minister to take note of the proposed Lee to sea greenway project which should receive attention in the Department in working with the county council and the city council on how a new greenway route can be promoted.  The Minister has been very supportive of the greenway programme.  This is a route which winds its way around the city of Cork towards the harbour, building on the success of other greenways.  It takes someone from Inniscarra Dam to Crosshaven, through Ballincollig, the city docklands, past Monkstown and so on.<\/p> <p>I have always found the Minister to be very fair.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, should have a regional office in Cork to drive the Cork metropolitan area strategy.  If we are serious about providing public transport, investing in cycling infrastructure and the regions beyond the M50, the NTA's decision not to locate a regional office in Cork as the lead agency for the Cork metropolitan area strategy is wrong.  I ask the Minister to communicate this to the NTA, with a view to looking at how its decision can be changed.  It is worth examining the issue.<\/p> <p>There is a major difficulty in the aviation sector in the country that we have to address.  I am not being critical of the Minister but of the decision made by the Commission for Aviation Regulation in the determination of charges at Dublin Airport in the period 2020 to 2024.  A price of &euro;7.87 has been set for the period, a figure which is 18% below Dublin Airport's flat price figure of &euro;9.65 discussed with the airlines 12 months ago.  I ask Members to note the words of the chief executive, Dalton Philips, who stated: \"Dublin Airport's prices are already 30 to 40% lower than its European peers and the Regulator's decision will mean Dublin's prices will now be almost 60% lower than the EU market price.\"  As the Minister is aware, the issue is about connectivity, on which, as an island nation, we are dependent.  It is also about the impact this decision will have on Cork, Shannon and other regional airports as the price set in Dublin is deemed to be the reference point for other airports throughout the country.  It will have a knock-on effect.  As the Minister knows, the use of infrastructure in the aviation industry is heavily dependent on what happens at Dublin Airport.  That cannot be good for all of us, which is why it is important that Aer Lingus, in particular, consider locating a hub in Cork.  I accept that it has undertaken a range of actions since the change in terms, but for us in Cork and, inadvertently, those involved in Shannon, it is about ensuring there is connectivity and that Cork Airport which is owned by the DAA will have its own capital expenditure programme.  Will that happen if the commission's decision stands?<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House and his work.  I ask that we examine the issue of funding for Cork Airport in the context of the NTA.  I refer, in particular, to Lehenaghmore, Matthew Hill, where Cork City Council is advertising a scheme under Part 8 for footpath and road realignment and the provision of public lighting.  It is a very important issue in the area where there are no footpaths along roads.  Permission was given for the construction of hundreds of houses without making provision for the inclusion of footpaths and public lighting.  I hope the Minister will communicate with the NTA on the importance of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#GG00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I call Senator O'Donnell, to whom I can only give three minutes as I must call the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#GG00400","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House.  Reflecting on the debate which has been centred on the lack of capacity, one of the successes in the area of public transport has been the train service.  Most weeks I use the Limerick to Dublin train service twice.  During the years capacity has increased exponentially in terms of the number of passengers travelling.  The difficulties in Dublin with capacity are a manifestation of the over-concentration of the population within the greater Dublin metropolitan area.  I have said many times that Shannon Airport is operating at approximately half capacity, whereas Dublin Airport is at breaking point.  I imagine that many commuters who use trains use them to access Dublin Airport.  We need a strong capital city, but we also have to look at the need for regional balance to take the pressure off Dublin and redirect traffic to areas from where there is access to, say, Shannon Airport.<\/p> <p>To follow up on the point made by Senator Buttimer about transportation, it is critical that there be proper transportation models in cities.  There is one under preparation for the Limerick-Shannon link.  It is the first time this has happened.  It will feed into the model for Shannon Airport and is a positive development.  It must be done in an integrated way in terms of planning, the provision of housing and so on. <\/p> <p>I know that in referring to the M20 project I am slightly off topic in this debate, but what is its current status?  It is a hugely important project.  If we are to have proper competition in Ireland inc., there must be synergies in providing direct links to Cork, Limerick and Galway as counterpoints to Dublin.  Dublin, with its huge population, is in the east and there must be a counterpoint to it in the west.  It is not all about public transport.  There have to be connections which can be used by cars, bus services and so forth.<\/p> <p>My final point is more of a housekeeping matter.  While sports capital grants are most welcome, an issue that comes up repeatedly concerns the interaction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor Office, of which the Minister is probably well aware, where if the total value of grants giiven to a club exceeds a certain amount, a legal charge must be paid to the State.  This is causing untold difficulties for individual clubs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have brought this matter up with the Minister's Department and the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has responsibility for the CSSO, the need to have a designated section within the CSSO to deal specifically with sports capital grants because it is dealing with voluntary associations.

The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann did consider that option but the costs turned out to be three times greater than expected, a cost of almost two thirds of a new carriage with a lifespan of around one third, so it was not value for money.  The NTA also looked into buying second-hand stock.  That was actively explored but there were concerns about availability, age of fleet, compatibility and cost.  Again, it was not considered to be value for money, which the Senator would be concerned about.  The 41 carriages were considered to be the best option and that is being pursued.  <\/p><p>As I also mentioned, a much bigger expansion under the DART programme is on the way with a minimum of 300 carriages and a maximum of 600.  On the sports capital &ndash; I am trying to get through this at a rate of one person a minute but it is difficult &ndash; the Senator referred specifically to County Leitrim, which is fair enough.  Under the 2018 round we moved away from the <i>per capita<\/i>to demand for the first time.  This is a huge step and the people who are not happy with this are the sports clubs in Dublin, for reasons that are quite clear.  I am not arguing either case here today because that is a long argument.  Last time, under the old system, the Dublin clubs all received pretty full allocations for valid applications but under the new system they do not.  There is a good argument for the <i>per capita<\/i>grant which they received but we have moved away from that in the direction of clubs outside Dublin and the heavy population areas.  Leitrim and other clubs elsewhere will have benefited from that.  The overall fund is split by county.  Essentially, clubs compete only with others from the same county.  Overall I would have thought that even though I am a Dubliner, Dublin people would perceive this as not being so favourable to them as the system was in the past. <\/p><p>Senator Boyhan talked about the number of trains at peak times and that he would like to see incentives for people to travel at different times to reduce the numbers.  That is a fairly good idea, or a plausible one.  The NTA is the body which decides the ticket prices and it has been considering ways to improve the overall ticketing system, whether by price or technology.  Some people would say an attractive system is one that is simple to understand and a proliferation of charges sometimes goes against that.  I do not know what the merits of the argument are but I do not decide the prices.  It is perfectly appropriate for the Senator to raise the issue here but I do not decide the prices.  People expect me to say it should be decided in this House but I do not.  That is what the NTA is for but it has considered that.  It has increased off-peak trains in order to make it more attractive to people to travel at different times because they will be less crowded.  That has had a limited amount of success.  <\/p><p>On sports capital, I think Senator Boyhan acknowledged that we have made incredible efforts to make this new system as transparent as possible.  That has met with quite a lot of resistance in political circles.  I do not think that is any secret.  It is to make it quite obvious how these are awarded and that they are not awarded by politicians moving them around or preferring their own clubs one way or another and changing the order.  We have a scoring system which is absolutely transparent.  Senator Buttimer referred to it, he did not like it particularly or he wanted to improve the scoring system.  That is perfectly fair enough.  There are problems.  I took his point about the Pobal index.  It is a reasonable one and should be considered again.  We have made the system utterly transparent.

I will not say too much about it, but I have made moves towards an all-Ireland football team.  I have suggested it in certain quarters but one is presented with great difficulties the moment one opens one's mouth in this regard.  As the Senator said so eloquently, this works incredibly successfully in other sports.  I would love to see an all-island football team but I recognise the political difficulties.  That does not mean that these difficulties are insuperable.  I call on the Senator and other politicians to co-operate in this sphere, as I know he will.  Sport is a wonderful healer of wounds.  We are bringing communities together and the great leap to an all-Ireland football team would be good for the nation and would help with the issues of sectarianism and the difficult problems we face in this country, which have been underlined by Brexit.

As in the past, including in the debate on these tragic circumstances in the D&aacute;il last week, I express my sincere condolences and those of my Government colleagues to the O'Farrell family on the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell.<\/p><p>I stress that we are all working towards achieving the same goal, that of responding appropriately to the acute pain of the O'Farrell family arising from that dreadful loss and of addressing, in a meaningful way, their search for answers.  In this context, I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify a number of important points regarding this matter.  I look forward to a constructive debate on how we can fully address this matter in a legally robust way.<\/p><p>The circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell have been addressed on several occasions in this House and the other House.  As I said in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 November, the terms of reference of the scoping exercise being conducted by Judge Haughton were finalised in September.  Since that debate, Judge Haughton has made his interim report to me and is making progress.  I will return to that shortly but first let me assure the Seanad that there is absolutely no intention on the part of myself or the Government to limit in any way the scoping exercise under way.<\/p><p>The terms of reference of the scoping exercise are focused, as required by the law and clearly set out by the Supreme Court in Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin, to reduce the risk of legal challenge to the recommendations of the scoping exercise.  The judgment of the Supreme Court requires the terms of reference of a scoping exercise to be as specific as possible to remove potential ambiguity and focused enough to promote a timely outcome to ensure fairness to all parties.  However, they still allow for review of the issues intended.<\/p><p>In his interim report, Judge Haughton set out the issues he is considering in some detail.  He said that he plans to conclude his scoping exercise without delay.  My Department is providing assistance to him to seek to ensure that his important work can be completed as soon as is possible, particularly in terms of ensuring he has access to all relevant documentation from a range of sources.  I understand that he has shared his interim report with the O'Farrell family and I intend to publish it shortly, following ongoing consultation with the judge himself and with the O'Farrell family.<\/p><p>I also very much welcome the fact that the O'Farrell family have decided to work with Judge Haughton and to supply him with the documentation they have in their possession.  It will be important to ensure that the judge has sufficient time to fully consider what I understand is a significant volume of documentation in reaching his final conclusions.<\/p><p>In terms of that final report, I want to be clear that Judge Haughton is free to make any recommendation he sees fit, including recommending the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  It is also the case that the O'Farrell family is free to make any representations they wish to him in respect of any matter into which they wish to see inquiries made.  The judge has made that clear in his interim report to me.  Should he recommend an inquiry of whatever type, he has been asked to provide draft terms of reference for such an inquiry for obvious reasons.<\/p><p>I am anxious to see real progress on this tragic matter.  However, in view of the motion that was passed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week to widen his terms of reference, I ask Senators to appreciate that I cannot, and should not, prejudge Judge Haughton's report or change his terms of reference in a way that does not comply fully with the law.  I take this opportunity to respond directly to the concerns with regard to the terms of reference of the judge's scoping exercise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In establishing the scoping exercise itself and in determining its terms of reference, I have been guided by legal advice from the Attorney General.

He is also very dedicated to the work he has been asked to undertake for which I am very grateful to him.  I know he has been engaging closely with the O'Farrell family and I would hope to see that engagement continuing in this sensitive and tragic case.  <br\/><br\/>I ask all Senators to reflect on the situation as I have laid it out and to join me in seeking to make progress on this matter as quickly as possible through the process that is already in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#JJ00800","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House this afternoon to discuss the tragic and evolving story of the death of Shane O'Farrell who, as we all know, died as a result of a road traffic accident in County Monaghan in August 2011.  He was killed in a hit-and-run by a man who had 42 previous convictions.  The driver of the car was on bail in respect of several offences.  He had breached the conditions of those bail bonds and had been serving suspended sentences that should have been activated, had the courts been informed of his convictions.  In short, had the criminal justice system been functioning properly, the driver would not have been at liberty on the day he drove that car and was involved in that hit-and-run.  The family, naturally, are devastated by their tragic loss.<\/p> <p>A Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, investigation commenced in early 2012.  It was, I am disappointed to say, a total failure.  It dragged on for over seven years and left the family with no real answers.  While it was one of the cases referred under the independent review mechanism to consider allegations of Garda misconduct or inadequacies in the investigation of such allegations, the independent review mechanism directed no further action because the matter was with GSOC.  Clearly, there are still questions to be answered.<\/p> <p>On 14 June 2018, the D&aacute;il voted in favour of a motion calling on the Government to immediately establish a public inquiry into the death of Shane.  On 5 February 2019, the Minister appointed Judge Haughton to conduct a scoping inquiry into matters surrounding Shane's death.  The Minister sought to significantly curtail the terms of reference of that inquiry, as drafted by Judge Haughton, and in doing so has undermined the process of the scoping exercise and placed significant restrictions on Judge Haughton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#KK00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>That is not so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#KK00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I do, however, take on board the presentation of the Minister at the outset of the debate.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward the motion calling on the Minister to adopt the terms of reference as drafted by Judge Haughton.  As the Minister knows, terms of reference are clearly binding on an inquiry.  They establish the jurisdiction of that inquiry in setting out what it can and cannot inquire into.  Limiting the terms of reference of this matter significantly limits what can be considered by the judge and, consequently, what recommendations the judge can ultimately make.  The terms of reference, as they currently stand, do not reflect the spirit of the D&aacute;il vote and nor will they enable us, as a nation, to learn of the extent of the dysfunctionality of elements of our criminal justice system.  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion was passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but the Minister has refused to broaden the terms of reference.<\/p> <p>The O'Farrell family, as we all know, have worked tirelessly seeking to get justice for their son and brother.  The State has failed them in the manner in which the death of Shane was investigated and prosecuted.  The State failed the family in the manner in which their complaints around the investigation and prosecution were handled by GSOC.  The State is continuing to fail them in the attempt to limit the terms of reference of the scoping exercise.<\/p> <p>The O'Farrell family must be commended on the courageous and dignified way in which they are pursuing justice for Shane.  They have been unrelenting in their quest for justice and by so doing, they are doing the utmost to honour Shane's life.  In many ways, the lives of the O'Farrell family are in stand-by mode and have been for more than seven years.  It is difficult for the ordinary man or woman in the street to comprehend why the wrong that was done was not made right at the first available opportunity.  Here we are and, in the Minister's words, not for the first time he is in this Chamber explaining what the State is doing in order to address the wrong.  <\/p> <p>The O'Farrell family have not had the time to mourn properly the death of their son.  It is bad enough for any parent to bury a child.  It is totally unnatural and goes against the grain of life as we know it.  To compound that tragic loss is the fact that a wrong was done and that wrong still has not been righted.  Clearly, there is a responsibility on us all, as legislators, and the least the O'Farrell family deserve is for the truth to be told about what happened not only so that the O'Farrell family can get justice and time to mourn the tragic loss of their son and brother but that we, as a State, can learn from the shortcomings that were illustrated clearly by this entire episode.  We, as a State, must learn from the wrongs that have been done and can learn what actions must be taken in future to ensure that we will not be discussing another family at another time in this House or the Lower House.<\/p> <p>I listened to the Minister's words with great intent.  I was heartened, as I am sure the O'Farrell family will be, by one sentence the Minister repeated.  He said he is anxious to see progress on this matter, as we all are, and I ask that the Minister, through his good offices, will consult with the O'Farrell family.  There is no point in us doing scoping exercises unless all the parties, particularly the O'Farrell family, are happy with what has gone into that scoping exercise.  All we want is closure and the O'Farrell family deserve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#KK00400","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il and the Seanad both passed strong resolutions calling for an independent inquiry to be established into the death of Shane O'Farrell.  The Minister has not acceded to this so he is actually in defiance of the wish of both Houses of Parliament and that is an extraordinary situation.<\/p> <p>I listened to the Minister on the wireless during the week and he said that Judge Haughton had been appointed and was in a position to make recommendations regarding the terms of reference for the scoping inquiry.  That was very disingenuous because we knew beforehand that the Minister had rejected Judge Haughton's detailed suggestions about the terms of reference of the scoping inquiry.  The Minister had already turned them down.  It is rather extraordinary for the Minister to go around saying that Judge Haughton could make representations on this.  The O'Farrell family also made representations and were ignored.<\/p> <p>The Minister has replied to questions in the other House.  On 12 March 2019, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked a question and the Minister's reply was that he had \"invited them to give their views on those terms of reference directly to Judge Haughton\".  He continued by stating \"Judge Haughton has met the O'Farrell family to discuss the terms of reference and to seek their input into any amendments that might be required.\"  He further stated \"Of course, it is open to Judge Haughton to propose changes to the terms of reference to me\" and \"I have not placed any restriction on Judge Haughton\".

In response, the Minister stated:<\/p><blockquote>I invited them to give their views on those terms of reference to the judge ... I understand that Judge Haughton has met with the family to discuss the terms of reference and to seek their input into any amendments which might be required.<\/blockquote><p>That deliberately gives the impression that the O'Farrell family and Judge Haughton will be listened to, but they were not listened to and considerable restrictions were placed by the Minister on the terms of reference for the scoping inquiry.  My good friend from Fianna F&aacute;il stated he accepted the Minister's good intentions - we all do - and he hoped the O'Farrell family would be satisfied, but they are not satisfied.  They are very far from satisfied.  They are utterly disgusted by the situation and have made that clear in any meeting I have had with them.  The family say they are concerned that the rejection of the judge's proposed terms of reference undermines the scoping inquiry and that the new terms of reference proposed by the Department are deliberately narrow, thereby limiting the scope of what can be considered by the judge.  That is not being satisfied; it is being very dissatisfied.<br\/><br\/>In June 2018, the D&aacute;il overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for an independent public inquiry, which was followed up by this House.  I tabled exactly the same motion that Fianna F&aacute;il had tabled in the D&aacute;il and it was passed unopposed.  Neither the spirit nor intent of the resolution, however, has been enacted by the Minister or his Department.  Instead, in February 2019, the Minister chose to appoint a retired District Court judge, Judge Gerard Haughton, to conduct a scoping exercise to address the public controversy surrounding the circumstances of Shane's tragic death.  The O'Farrell family met Judge Haughton and had a good, positive meeting, following comments by the Minister to the effect that the family would have an opportunity to consult the judge in respect of the terms.  The terms of reference under which the scoping exercise will be conducted are crucial.  They tell the whole story.  The scoping inquiry sets it down clearly.  To limit it is to limit any inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Shane O'Farrell.<br\/><br\/>Judge Haughton subsequently submitted terms of reference to the Department on 24 April 2019.  The family respect the terms, which go some way to reflect the spirit of the motions passed by the Houses.  The Department rejected Judge Haughton's terms of reference and further narrowed the original terms of reference, which the Department had proposed in February 2019.  I have a list of clear, specific and factual complaints from the family.  The Department removed references to Shane and the family's rights under the ECHR to ensure an effective investigation into the unlawful killing.  To date, the State has failed in its obligations under the ECHR.  It removed consideration of the prosecution of Shane's case, the first matter for consideration by the Department in the February terms of reference, and any consideration of the coroner's inquest into Shane's death, in which serious irregularities have emerged, yet they are not being investigated.  Surely to God this is the precisely the type of matter that should be examined and included in the terms of reference.  The Department also removed any investigation into the previous prosecutions of the accused, despite him being in breach of multiple counts of bail when he killed Shane.  It is tragic that the car which killed him was stopped a couple of hours before the accident and drugs were found in the car.  The car was defective, it had not passed the national car test and it was not licensed.  It should have been seized at that point, and Shane O'Farrell's death would not have taken place.  The Department has limited the judge to take into account the outcome of reports prepared - reports that, in the family's view, are deficient - rather than a review of the investigations behind the reports, as originally envisaged in the February terms of reference.<br\/><br\/>The family have stated:<\/p><blockquote>An independent public inquiry is the last chance for the State to meet its ECHR obligations to investigate properly Shane&rsquo;s unlawful killing and to carry out an effective investigation into the true and full circumstances of the unlawful killing and the role of State authorities in Shane&rsquo;s death.  The family has the utmost respect for Judge Haughton, however the family believe that the terms of reference now proposed by the department do not reflect the spirit of the D&aacute;il and Seanad resolution.  [It is clear that is the case.]  These terms will not allow the inquiry to ascertain the full and relevant facts pertaining to Shane&rsquo;s case and appear to be an attempt to curtail the scope of the Inquiry and further delay matters.  The terms proposed by the department would lead to a narrow and unfair consideration of the complex legal and public policy issues that are at play in Shane&rsquo;s case and they are not sufficiently broad or exhaustive to address the State&rsquo;s ECHR obligations.  The family attend D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today [to speak about the case].<\/blockquote><p>In his speech, the Minister seemed to hide behind the Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin judgment but he is being unnecessarily coy in his approach.  He stated he must act within in the law and that the terms of reference must respect the law.  His proposed amendment to the motion stated, &quot;[T]he terms of reference of the scoping exercise must be compliant with the line of jurisprudence established by the Supreme Court in the case of Shatter<i>v.<\/i>Guerin&quot;.  In my opinion, the terms are compliant.  Does the Minister seriously think Judge Haughton would propose something illegal?  He has paid tribute to the judge's long experience and expertise in matters of law, but he suggested that he might propose something illegal.<br\/><br\/>I will read the Minister's reply with great interest.

I again offer our sympathies to Lucia O'Farrell and her family, whom we met in Leinster House.  Senator Gallagher welcomed the part of the Minister's speech when he stated he wanted there to be progress on the matter.  I wish to correct that.  The Minister wants the truth on the matter and the matter to be concluded, as does every Senator.  An eminent judge has been appointed and has delivered an interim report to the Government, which is being considered by the Attorney General, the Minister and the Government, in conjunction with the family.  The Government will abide by whatever recommendations are made when the judge delivers his final report.  It will facilitate whatever type of inquiry Judge Haughton recommends but the process must be allowed to conclude.<\/p> <p>One cannot just turn one's back on recent case law.  If a Government did that, it would be accused of being negligent and of not respecting or taking into account judgments of the Supreme Court, and this will not happen.  Nevertheless, a family is grieving, and needs and deserves answers.  They deserve that this jurisdiction and its structures will deliver those answers.  I hope the judge recommends a full inquiry but I will not pre-empt what he will recommend.  I have no doubt he will recommend what, in his wisdom and vast experience over decades in the legal profession, he deems to be appropriate and likely to achieve a swift result.<\/p> <p>I recall well when this tragic case happened because it was only two or three months after I was elected to the House for the first time.  I was elected in May 2011 and it happened during the summer.  It was terrible.  I am an alumnus of UCD, like Shane O'Farrell.  We were all horrified and it is horrific to think that somebody on bail, with all those convictions, would be in a position to cause such unspeakable grief for a decent family, who work hard and have always done their best and more.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have a responsibility to assist in bringing closure or finality to this.

I will never forget that meeting.  As a long-standing Deputy, the Minister for Justice and Equality will appreciate that some meetings with families that have been through unspeakable grief are harrowing.  My memory of that meeting is that the family had been destroyed by tragedy.  Shane's mother, Lucia, had a framed picture of her beloved son and she had so many questions.  It has been a long and hard road to get to the process now under way with Judge Haughton.  The family has seen much disappointment and frustration.<\/p><p>It was clear from early on that the matters arising were not solely applicable to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they related almost to the entire criminal justice system and how it functions not just in this State but throughout the island, how it communicates and how it ensures that those who are a threat to the public can be taken off the streets.  These are very serious matters.  It was always going to require much more than just a GSOC investigation as the scope needed to be much wider.  The only way of getting to the truth is a full public inquiry.<\/p><p>It is the duty of any Government to respect the wishes of the majority of democratically elected representatives.  A majority of the D&aacute;il voted for a public inquiry and we unanimously passed a motion in this Chamber seeking a public inquiry.  The Minister will recall that the motion, tabled by Senator David Norris and similar to the previous D&aacute;il motion, laid out the catalogue of failure that culminated in the circumstances that led to Shane's death.  Rather than respecting the democratic wishes of the Members of both Houses, the Minister proceeded to get advice and asked Judge Haughton to carry out this scoping exercise.<\/p><p>It makes me angry today that the Minister referred to the track record of Judge Haughton and how eminent he is because nobody has disputed that.  The family has made clear its absolute respect for Judge Haughton but its issue is with the Department of Justice and Equality.  The family's issue is with the Minister's statement that his Department has no wish to interfere with the remit of Judge Haughton, whom he speaks of in venerable terms today; it is exactly what the Department has done.  Judge Haughton engaged with the O'Farrell family and he is an eminent man of the law.  He is fully aware of the Supreme Court decision referred to by the Minister and, in his wisdom, he submitted terms of reference to the Minister that are precise and would allow us to get to the truth.  They are within the framework of the European Convention on Human Rights, which all governments must adhere to in such cases.  The Department has chosen to reject those, so the only people demonstrating disrespect to Judge Haughton are the Minister and his officials.  There is nobody else.  We do not need the Minister to lecture us on his view of this judge as he has demonstrated profound disrespect to him and his interpretation of the law.<\/p><p>I recall the Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin episode well as I was my party's justice spokesperson at the time.  It is incredible that the Minister would present this case as the context for seriously amending the terms of reference presented by Judge Haughton.  The issue at stake there was an investigation carried out by Mr. Guerin, a senior counsel, who did not consult the then Minister with responsibility for justice, Mr. Alan Shatter, to establish a response to the issues that were at stake but who had consulted other parties.  The finding was a lack of justice in that but it has no application to this matter because Judge Haughton is not making commentary on the standing of any persons.  He is merely making recommendations as to what way we should proceed to get to the truth and justice.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality has historically been one of the most conservative Departments in government and resistant to change, and it has failed in so many ways, as evidenced by a multitude of episodes in recent years leading to two Ministers and other senior personnel having to resign.  It is astounding that motions from the D&aacute;il and Seanad have instructed the Government to move to a public inquiry but the Minister has not done that.  It has given the task to Judge Haughton and the Minister spoke about his track record, which nobody has questioned.  The family has outlined clearly its respect for the judge.<\/p><p>It is outrageous that we are here again today having to engage with the Minister.  I have no doubt that despite the outcome of today's statements, he will refuse to accept the will of the D&aacute;il, as he did last week and will do in regard to this House again today.  He has no respect for these two Houses on this matter.  If he did, the Minister would stand up to his departmental officials.  If he respected Judge Haughton, he would stand over his proposed terms of reference but he has not done so.  Yet again we have another Minister who refuses to stand up to the conservative elements in this Department, thereby failing a family.<\/p><p>The family members are watching this on the live feed and could not be here because of the short notice for today's debate.  If they were here, they would say that the death of their beloved son and brother would not have been in vain if we could get to the truth and change our criminal justice system, the way An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na communicates with our courts and the Police Service of Northern Ireland or how our courts communicate with each other on this island.  If this could happen, no other family would have to endure what they have had to.  If this is about getting to the truth, learning lessons and honouring the memory of that young man, the Minister must stand up to the officials in the Department and give Judge Haughton the framework he requested.  He must enable us in getting to the truth.  That is his challenge and although I hope he can accept it, I very much doubt he will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#MM00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and the fact that the Leader acceded to our request when Senator Rose Conway-Walsh and I asked that these statements take place today on the Order of Business earlier.  I am grateful for that.<\/p> <p>It is disappointing that we are again debating the need for a public inquiry into the death of Mr. Shane O'Farrell.  This is a matter we all thought had been resolved by previous debates and votes on motions in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, as other speakers have noted.  Like them, I express my condolences to the O'Farrell family on the tragic loss of their son and brother, Shane, who as we know was killed in a tragic event on 2 August 2011, more than eight years ago, when he was cycling near Carrickmacross.  Shane and his family have a long connection with Trinity College Dublin and the law school in particular there.  I commend my TCD colleague, Senator David Norris, who has led in making representations on behalf of the family in this House.

We are back here again because of the family's serious concerns about the failure to implement in full the express wishes of the D&aacute;il and Seanad on the need for a public inquiry.  That is what makes this so disappointing.  Like others, I have spoken to Lucia, Gemma and the O'Farrell family when they were in front of Leinster House some two weeks ago to express their concerns about the narrowing of the terms of reference, which appear to be much more restrictive than those originally drawn up for the scoping exercise to be conducted by Judge Haughton, for whom, like others, I have immense respect.  However, it is unfortunate that these terms of reference have been so narrowed.  I am glad that today the Minister has clarified to the Seanad that there is no impediment on Judge Haughton to make any recommendation he sees fit and that the O'Farrell family is free to make representations to him.<br\/><br\/>However, it is unfortunate that the Minister referred to the case of Shatter <i>v. <\/i>Guerin, as others have noted.  In the D&aacute;il, my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Penrose, also spoke on this.  What should have been done in respect of Shatter <i>v. <\/i>Guerin, was that the Government should have reverted to the D&aacute;il and Seanad as promised, if a proposal was going to be put forward on the Attorney General's advice to amend the terms of reference.  Instead, it was an Opposition motion that brought the Government back to the House on the issue in the D&aacute;il last week and it is a request by the Opposition which brought the Minister here before the Seanad today to deal with the issue again.  It is unfortunate that there is not a more proactive approach being taken by the Government on this matter, given the express wishes of both D&aacute;il and Seanad to see a public inquiry established.<br\/><br\/>Senator Norris and others have listed the family's points of concerns but they are that the terms of reference are more restrictive and in particular that they do not facilitate the inquiry being conducted into two specific issues.  The first is a review of the investigations carried out to date, given the piecemeal investigations meaning that each procedural failing was looked at and treated as a separate event, rather than enabling us to have an overview of the entire chain of events and what we have described previously as a litany of failures across policing and justice agencies on both sides of the Border.  That is important.  As I have said previously, we have seen a number of different reports over some years, notably reports from the Garda Inspectorate, from Mr. Sean Guerin, senior counsel, and from the Morris tribunal, which have been highly critical of failings in policing and in criminal justice administration in the Border counties and a lack of communication in particular, between policing and prosecuting authorities on both sides of the Border.  That is the first point that needs to be addressed in a scoping exercise and subsequently in a public inquiry.  We also need a review of changes in law and practice in the context of bail and bench warrants.  Lack of communications amounted to a serious issue.  Because of gaps in the system, as other have noted, someone who should have been stopped and who arguably should not have been at liberty was free to perpetrate this utterly tragic and horrific death.  This is a breakdown in the criminal justice system and in our system of policing.  That is why all of us in these Houses have called for a public inquiry, to ensure that not only do we know what happened and what was the chain of events that led to the death of Shane O'Farrell so tragically in August 2011 but also to ensure that we can identify the system failings that occurred and that contributed to that death to ensure that they will not be allowed to happen again. <br\/><br\/>To conclude on a different note, as someone who cycles every day and who has regularly raised issues around cycle safety in this House, I am concerned about a failure to ensure adequate safety for cyclists and a failure to prioritise the safety of cyclists in national transport policy.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was just in the House dealing with transport issues.  There has been a real lack of prioritisation of cyclists and of cycle safety.  Only in the last few weeks there was a very tragic death of a cyclist in my local area of Dublin 8, on the South Circular Road.  We have seen a number of really awful accidents and deaths of cyclists on our roads in recent years.  Not only do we need to ensure that we have a means of addressing systemic failures in criminal justice and in policing where people can continue to drive when they clearly should have been put off the road, but we must also address systemic failings in our transport policy that lead to a lack of safety for cyclists on our roads.  I speak as someone who sees daily the real hazards for cyclists in Dublin city centre in the lack of joined-up thinking around provision of Luas, road layout and facilities for cyclists and pedestrians.  Cycle safety is also a real concern looking outside Dublin.  That is part of the context in which this horrific death happened.  I will conclude by expressing my admiration and respect for the O'Farrell family, and for the dignity and persistence they have shown in seeking to ensure that nobody else will suffer the same tragedy they did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#MM00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming at such short notice.

They have engaged with me, more than I have them, and I met them outside Leinster House.  That is an important space for the public and for citizens to come and engage with us.  I always said I would like to see more people on this side of the gate rather than on the other side.  People come to Leinster House regularly.  There can be ten or 12 issues or campaigns here every day.  They bring great meaning and it is a great place of engagement when people come to the gates of our Parliament and when politicians take the time and the trouble to go out to those gates and listen to those people.  I had the opportunity to meet the extended O'Farrell family on several occasions.  I met them two weeks ago and I thank them for coming with their message.<\/p> <p>Let us put some context on this.  In 2011, Shane O'Farrell at 23 years the only son of the O'Farrell family, was killed in a horrific hit and run by a man who had multiple breaches of bail and who should have been in State custody.  Shane was studying the law while others were breaking it.  He had just completed his degree in law at UCD and his masters in law in Trinity College Dublin.  As others have observed, the D&aacute;il and Seanad passed resolutions calling on the Minister to have a public inquiry but to date, to great disappointment, there has been no public inquiry.  As the Minister knows, it is alleged that there was Garda interference in this case.  The criminal justice system has let down the O'Farrell family in this case and it is clear that there are serious failures in the criminal justice system and too many questions in respect of this case remain unanswered.  <\/p> <p>It is paramount that the public confidence in the working operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system are upheld.  The Minister has always said that and I do not doubt his commitment for one moment to ensuring there is public confidence.  However, this case has dented public confidence.  It is a really serious case that has been covered by most media outlets.  People are outraged and concerned at how this case has ended up so far.  There is an obligation on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring persons convicted of criminal offences, while serving suspended sentences, before the courts and to inform the sentencing court in respect of a person who has been convicted of subsequent offences.  Where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes aware that a person has breached or is in breach of conditions of bail, there is an obligation on such a member to bring that breach to the attention of the court.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is also an obligation, which the Minister will be familiar with, of bringing the breach to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, so that it can be properly investigated.  All of the complaints it receives are investigated and determined in an appropriate and timely manner and fashion.<\/p><p>I note the points that the Minister made when he summarised his statement here today and felt reassured.  I  acknowledge that he said there is no impediment on Judge Haughton \"to make any recommendation he sees fit, including recommending the establishment of any form of [...] inquiry\" in the future.  The Minister continued: \"The O'Farrell family is free to make any representations they wish to [Judge Haughton] in respect of any matter into which they wish to see inquiries made\".  Those comments give me hope and we have to have hope.  I shall finish as I started by saying that I do not believe that anyone in this Chamber is trying to block justice.  It is a difficult situation to be fair.  Process has to be followed and it is important that we get this right.  Clearly, it is unacceptable that this has gone on for so long.  We are back in here today and, hopefully, we are going to assist in progressing this matter.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well with this sensitive issue.  It is important that in some way we respect the sensitivities and acknowledge the separation of powers and the importance of the judge in this case.  We must also acknowledge the family, their grief and their circumstances.

We are here not because he tragically died, because the sad reality is that people die and lose their lives every day.  We are here because of the systematic failures that did not necessarily lead to Shane's death but certainly it could have been prevented had the failures not existed.<\/p> <p>I am very conscious of all of the legal language that has been used here today.  It is important that those views are articulated and those arguments are made in this institution.  The last time we spoke about this matter the House agreed that there should be a public inquiry.  It is incumbent upon us to refocus our minds on the fact that there is a family grieving the loss of a loving son and brother.  I have had the unfortunate honour and privilege of knowing many campaigning families and individuals who have had to fight to access truth and justice, and some of them had to fight for 50 years.  Sadly, some of these people are still fighting to access truth and justice.  It is a great travesty and injustice that we would further heap trauma on already suffering and hurting families.<\/p> <p>The Minister is meant to take his mandate and direction from the will of these Houses and, indeed, use his own counsel.  I do not doubt for one second, as Senator Boyhan said, that there is no-one in this House who does not want to get to the truth but I wonder about the people outside this House because of the following simple reality.  If all of the evidence and rationale points to systematic failures from top to bottom, across the Border, back and forward, and between policing institutions and criminal justice institutions, then what is the rationale for not giving a family who have diligently campaigned and suffered so much what I think is a very modest thing in the context of a public inquiry?  The establishment of an inquiry is the will of both of these Houses.  The family desire an inquiry and I believe that it is also the desire of the vast bulk of people within Irish life.  I think there is a clear rationale for an inquiry.  There is a political and legal impetus on us to do it because of the clear and obvious failures.  The curtain should not come done on this matter and the faceless bureaucrats in the Departments should not revert to their old traditional ways.  We should focus our minds on shining a light on and rectifying what was a clear problem and clear failings that led to the life of a young brilliant man with so much potential being tragically and needlessly cut short.<\/p> <p>I reiterate the call for a public inquiry because it is a great shame that we are forcing a family into a situation where they have to accept and concede to something less.  Today, I speak with great disappointment but great feeling and solidarity with the O'Farrell family.  I do not want to end my contribution on a negative note but I must end it on an unfortunate note.  I have had the privilege of getting to know many campaigning families so I recognise a slow waltz when I see one and I sense that this is a slow waltz.  I am equally encouraged by the campaigning families and, indeed, by the O'Farrell family and not least by Lucia.  They are not going anywhere and should this take 50 years or more they will continue campaigning.  We could ease or lift their burden of further stress and avoid re-traumatising them if we acceded to their request, and the will of these Houses, and gave them the public inquiry that they deserve and one we are compelled to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#OO00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>As no other Senators have indicated a wish to speak I call on the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#OO00300","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I very much agree with what I think every Senator has said,  namely, that this is a most important and sensitive matter.

Judge Haughton is not restricted in recommending any form of further inquiry or terms of reference in that regard.  There is a desire on all our parts to get to the truth.  In doing so, we should not open a scoping exercise up to legal challenge by requiring it to look into matters more appropriate to a full inquiry, which is of course something that Judge Haughton is free to recommend in any event.  The simple and unavoidable fact is that the scoping exercise must be carried out in accordance with the law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask Senators to recognise that this is in the interest of all concerned, including, crucially, the O'Farrell family.  We would not serve them well by establishing a scoping exercise without regard for the law because that would leave the resulting recommendations open to legal challenge.  While the terms of reference of the scoping exercise are focused as required by law, they still allow for a review of the issues intended.  Judge Haughton is free in his final report to make any recommendations he deems fit, including setting up any form of statutory, or indeed non-statutory, inquiry.  <\/p><p>I welcome the constructive contribution and comments made by Senator Boyhan and I share his concern regarding the timescale involved.  I am keen to ensure that we allow Judge Haughton proceed and establish the appropriate terms of reference as he deems fit in his final report.  None of us should prejudge the report or its recommendations.  We should also not risk delaying or undermining that important work by changing the terms of reference when Judge Haughton has already made good progress in the scoping exercise or by asking him to work under terms of reference not in compliance with the law.  That would render his work vulnerable to legal challenge and further delay, and would not serve anybody well, especially not the O'Farrell family. <\/p><p>I and the Government recognise, appreciate and share the consistent interest Senators have taken in this tragedy.  As Senator Boyhan rightly commented, however, we all have the same objective and we are working towards achieving it.  I readily accept that the process is taking longer than any of us would have wished.  I ask Senators, however, to recognise that the process should continue in accordance with the law and without delay or the additional risk of confusion that could arise from interference with the ongoing work of Judge Haughton.  A clear process is in place and Judge Haughton has committed to producing his final report in the coming months.  The O'Farrell family is working with his scoping exercise to ensure that all of the facts, and I do not say that lightly, are fully considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#OO00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>They will have little choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#PP00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will not be interrupted by political commentary from anyone.

The Government does not oppose this Bill in principle.  I agree with the core objective of assisting people with minor convictions who have moved on from offending and now wish to make a positive contribution to society without being constrained by their past.  We have to recognise, however, that the changes proposed are significant, including the changes Senator Ruane proposes to make on this Stage.  While I do not intend to oppose these changes at this time, I inform the House that I may well bring forward amendments at a future date to address any issues that may arise as a result of the detailed examination of the Bill and today's amendments being undertaken by my Department.<\/p> <p>As everybody will appreciate, this Bill requires careful and detailed consideration to take into account the perspectives of rehabilitation and community safety.  In particular, my Department, and others, will need to identify the possible implications of the recommendations of the joint committee's report on spent convictions.  These are, in part, reflected in some of the amendments being moved by Senator Ruane.  My officials met with the Senator earlier this month.  I hope she will agree that the engagement  was positive and there was a discussion of the objectives and implications of the obligations of the Bill, as well as the amendments before us.  It was useful and constructive dialogue.  <\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Ruane that we need to do a little more work.  We need more time to consider fully the implications of these proposed changes and the recommendations arising from the committee's report so as to achieve an appropriate balance.  We have to get the balance right between individual rehabilitation and community safety.  It will be important to analyse not only the type of offences that will become eligible under the provisions of this Bill, but also the knock-on effects of such changes for those involved and wider society.  It is also necessary to identify any implications that may arise for vetting.  Equally, it is vital that the needs of the victims of crime receive special attention, especially in the context of more serious offences that may qualify to become spent under the Bill.   Account must also be taken of offences committed by those under the age of 18 years and by young adults aged up to 25 years in respect of the specific provisions contained in this Bill.  Careful consideration will also be required of the operational implications of this approach regarding the possession of drugs for personal use and how that might be aligned with the overall regime for spent convictions.  <\/p> <p>I acknowledge what Senator Ruane said at the start of this debate and I thank her for agreeing to share her research and analysis with my Department.  It will be of great benefit to me and my officials in our work.  I assure the House that I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Ruane to progress this legislation in a meaningful way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I have stated directly to the Senator, my intention is to ensure that what we have by way of legislation is balanced, fair and effective in its approach from the perspectives of protecting the public and rehabilitating the offender.<\/p><p>I will address the amendments when the House reaches them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#PP01000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House's debate on the Bill.

This section would create a new category of discriminatory treatment whereby an employer would not be able to treat a current or prospective employee differently on the basis of a conviction if that conviction was regarded as spent under our spent conviction laws.  I am tabling these amendments on foot of recommendation No. 7 of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality's report on spent convictions, which called on a cross-party basis for this exact change to the Employment Equality Acts.<\/p><p>There is a major gap in our spent conviction laws whereby a spent conviction cannot be used to disadvantage someone in our courts but the same protection is not afforded to those seeking or maintaining employment, where this issue is far more likely to arise.  If someone's conviction is spent, he or she currently has the right not to disclose that conviction in a job interview.  However, in the era of the Internet and where background checks are becoming routine in recruitment, current and prospective employees need to be protected from being disadvantaged where the employer finds out about the conviction through other means.  When we legislate for a conviction to become spent, we are telling that individual that it is no longer on his or her record and he or she is entitled to no longer disclose it.  Without this amendment to employment law, however, we are implicitly allowing employers to discriminate on the basis of a conviction that the State has deemed no longer relevant.  The amendments would prohibit any requirement to disclose a conviction or circumstances ancillary to it if it is spent.<\/p><p>I wish to reserve the right to table a similar amendment on Report Stage relating to the Ban the Box campaign and to ensure that a prospective employee is only asked about his or her conviction history at a later stage in the application process when he or she has the opportunity to explain it and put it into context.<\/p><p>I hope that the Minister will accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#QQ01600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I am not opposing the amendments on this Stage, but I wish to give notice that I may table amendments of my own on Report Stage.

I am tabling them on foot of advice from the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, which has informed me that such a change is required as a consequence of the new provisions that I am proposing for young adults and the generally shorter rehabilitative periods they would have under the Bill.  The Children Act sets out the rehabilitative period for under 18s at a blanket three years.  Since we are creating in the Bill a new and more generous arrangement for those aged 18 to 24 years, however, the lowest rehabilitative period for that new cohort will actually be shorter at two years.  Therefore, there would be a major inconsistency within the Children Act, given that a young adult aged between 17 and 24 years would be treated more generously than those under the age of 18 years despite the special category of rights enjoyed by children under the Constitution.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am, therefore, advised by the OPLA that a consequential change to reduce the rehabilitative period for those under 18 to one year is needed.

The Bill currently defines the age as 23 and younger, and in these amendments I am proposing to increase it to 24 years and younger.  This is on foot of recommendation No. 9 of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality report, which specifically calls for a distinct approach and even proposed extending the provisions of the Children Act 2011 for those under 18 to the same age range.

It will remove the limit on the number of convictions that can become spent.  The single-conviction rule of the current law received significant criticism at the justice committee as a major barrier to access to spent convictions and as an interference with the right to privacy under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It was acknowledged it was a disproportionate limit on the rehabilitative potential law and that it needed reform.  My Bill, as initiated, proposed increasing the limit to two convictions for adults and three convictions for young adults.  In recommendation 4 of its report on spent convictions, however, the justice committee called for the removal of the limit altogether, citing the support of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission for the change.<\/p><p>I, therefore, propose the amendment to enact the change.  If we do not remove the limit, we will not be able to cater for those with clusters of offences.  Even if they took place decades earlier, they would never have an opportunity to become spent, irrespective of how minor they were.  If a person is on track to have his or her convictions spent, he or she must not offend for a significant period.  All indicators show that the length of the period without reoffending is the best indicator of someone's propensity to commit crime.  This should be the standard by which we allow someone to avail of a spent conviction, rather than an arbitrary restriction on the number that can become spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#SS00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>As in the case of previous amendments in the name of the Senator, I will not oppose the amendment, which will provide for the removal of the limit of the number of convictions eligible to become spent.

In the meantime, I commit to all five Senators that there will be a significant degree of consultation with a view to reaching an agreement before Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#SS02100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574245800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, to delete lines 14 to 25 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(b) by deleting subsections (2) and (4),&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#SS02300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574245800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, to delete lines 26 to 33 and substitute the following: &ldquo;(c) in subsection (5) &mdash; <blockquote>(i) in the definition of &ldquo;effective date of conviction&rdquo;, by substituting &ldquo;a relevant court&rdquo; for &ldquo;the District Court&rdquo;, and <br \/><br \/>(ii) in the definition of &ldquo;excluded offence&rdquo; by substituting &ldquo;2016;&rdquo; for &ldquo;2016.&rdquo;, and by inserting the following definitions after the definition of &ldquo;excluded offence&rdquo;: <blockquote>&ldquo; &lsquo;relevant court&rsquo; means the District Court or the Circuit Court; <br \/><br \/>&lsquo;relevant period&rsquo; in relation to a relevant sentence of a court imposed on a person, means the period that applies under section 4A of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 in respect of the sentence and includes any extension of that period under section 4B of that Act; <br \/><br \/>&lsquo;relevant sentence&rsquo; has the meaning given to it in Part 2 of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016.&rdquo;, <\/blockquote>and <\/blockquote>(d) by deleting subsection (6).&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112000002#SS02500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574245800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574245800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Section 7, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574245800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1574245800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, after line 33, to insert the following: <br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Amendment of Schedule 3 to Act of 2012 <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>8.<\/b>Schedule 3 to the Act of 2012 is amended in paragraph 16 by substituting &ldquo;an offence under&rdquo; for &ldquo;a first offence under&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>I have tabled the amendment in the same vein as amendment No. 15 and in light of the recently heralded shift in the Department towards a health-led approach to drug policy rather than one rooted in the criminal justice system.

I formally thank the Senator for her work, but I also thank the Independent Senators, Senators Black, Kelleher, Dolan, Higgins and Grace O'Sullivan, for supporting its presentation to the House.  It is an important issue, not only for those with convictions but also for society as a whole.<\/p> <p>I agree with the general objective of the Bill, as do my Government colleagues, as we strive to assist those with minor convictions who have moved away from offending and want to get on with their lives.  The amendments proposed by Senator Ruane go further than what was envisaged by her or her colleagues, but they take into account the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality in October this year.  I acknowledge the importance of that report in the context of this debate.  I also acknowledge the meetings that took place between my officials and Senator Ruane earlier this month.  I acknowledge what Senator Ruane said about the constructive nature of that engagement.  While I am generally supportive of the direction of the amendments, as are my Government colleagues, it has not been entirely possible within the time available to fully consider the implications of the committee's recommendations at an appropriate level of detail, in conjunction with the proposed amendments the Seanad has passed this afternoon.  However, I am happy to accept them in the knowledge that and against the background of further consultation being required to ensure unintended consequences will be avoided, for example, serious offences being captured unintentionally by the Bill, as constituted.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that there is great merit in the legislation and I am happy to work with Senator Ruane to progress the Bill further in order that it will be balanced and fair in its approach, both from the perspective of rehabilitation of the offender and given the crucial need to at all times protect the public.  I am committed to working further with Senator Ruane as this research and consultation progresses.  I acknowledge the welcome the Senator has given to this.  We will continue to engage, with a view to identifying amendments which might be needed on Report Stage because my objective is in line with those of the Independent Senators.  Their presence in numbers underlines the support for Senator Ruane and the importance they place on this reforming legislation.  At the end of Committee Stage our objective is the same, that is, to ensure the fairest possible outcome can be achieved for all citizens.
