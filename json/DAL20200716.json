At that meeting, the banks claimed the accrual or charging of additional interest during mortgage breaks in the context of Covid-19 was required by the regulator.  We know that was not true.

I look forward to working with Members of the D&aacute;il and with finance Ministers across Europe over the next two and a half years.<\/p><p>To deal with the Deputy's question, the members of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, BPFI, introduced a payment break for their customers on 18 March last.  These payment breaks were agreed quickly to provide substantial and rapid relief to worried and anxious borrowers, including mortgage holders, in situations where income had been directly impacted by Covid and during a fast-moving and evolving public health crisis.  At the end of June, almost 160,000 payment breaks had been approved for Irish borrowers, representing &euro;20.1 billion of loans.<\/p><p>Two weeks later, on 2 April, the European Banking Authority, EBA, published guidelines which set out the criteria that payment moratoria must meet in order to benefit from supervisory flexibility and for them to not automatically lead to loans being classified as forborne.  The key paragraph in relation to the charging of interest, paragraph 24, was interpreted in different ways across Europe.  I will not read the entire paragraph but I note that it refers to only allowing changes to the schedule of payments.  It goes on to state that moratoria, suspending, postponing or reducing payments, which could be principal, interest or both for a limited period of time, would clearly affect the whole schedule of payment and may lead to increased payments over the payment of the moratorium or an extended duration of the loan.  It goes on to note that other conditions of the loan, in particular the interest rate, should not be effected, unless such change only serves for compensation to avoid losses, which would allow the impact of the net present value to be neutralised.<\/p><p>Given the pre-existing EBA guidelines on the classification of default, the BPFI and its members sought to ensure that its payment break would not lead to the classification of loans as being non-performing.  Subsequently, in its letter to Deputy Doherty on 22 June, which was well after the meeting of 11 May, the Central Bank stated that the EBA was expected to provide further clarity on the specific issue of interest accrual and, I assume in light of the discussions then under way with the EBA, the Central Bank outlined that both the charging and non-charging of interest is acceptable under the guidelines.<\/p><p>The EBA duly provided clarification in its report of 7 July.  It confirmed in relation to the net present value, NPV, of a loan that:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...there may be a decline in the NPV if [...] no interest is charged for the time covered by the moratorium.  Alternatively, the moratorium may be NPV-neutral  [...] if subsequently at least one of the instalments is adjusted upwards or added. <\/blockquote>  <p>The EBA also confirmed that its guidelines on the classification of default did not apply to a loan and a payment break under a general moratorium.  The moratorium of the BPFI and the banks in Ireland complies fully with the EBA guidelines.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste and I are meeting the CEOs of the three main banks this week.  We are having our final meeting this afternoon and issues relating to the payment break will be discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600003#A00600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1594891800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>There was only one set of guidelines.  They have never changed.  I hope the Minister accepts that.  Clarification was provided during different periods.  The Minister is right to say I wrote to the Central Bank on 11 June.  I asked in my letter why Belgium and Spain were able to waive interest rates for consumers in those jurisdictions, while working to the same EBA guidelines.  I knew the answer but I wanted it in writing so I could show the Minister and others that this did not need to happen.  How did I know the answer?  I knew it because I had engaged with the Central Bank before that.  We have had conversations on this issue with the Governor of the Central Bank and we have looked at what has happened in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>We have also looked at the EBA guidelines of 2 April, selections from which the Minister read out, and the guidance that was provided on this issue on 25 March by the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, which included a clarification that it was not necessary for interest to accrue.  The Minister knows that because his colleagues in Spain and Belgium do not require interest to be charged, particularly in Belgium, on low-interest loans.<\/p> <p> What is the Minister's view of the fact that the CEO of KBC Bank sat at the meeting with the Minister and the Taoiseach where the chief executive officers of the main pillar banks said that interest must be charged, as required by the regulator?  They said this approach was required to prevent a loan from being considered as going into default.  The AIB representative said the risk was clear that if interest was not charged, there would be a default and there would be a credit rating on the customer.  The CEO of KBC Bank sat at that meeting.  KBC Bank operates in Belgium, where for low-interest customers with low incomes, interest is not charged during the payment breaks.  That is done under the exact same guidance the Irish pillar banks received, namely, the EBA guidelines that were issued on 2 April and the clarification that was issued on 25 March by the ESMA.  How can the Minister justify that?  More important is the fact that Permanent TSB, a State-owned bank, has made it very clear that if a customer takes a six-month break on a &euro;250,000 mortgage without an extension of the term, the bank will charge that customer an additional &euro;6,300.  How can the Minister for Finance, who holds the majority shareholding in that bank on behalf of the Irish people, tolerate such practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600003#A00700","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594892400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>It was my job as this issue was developing to work with the banks to ensure provisions were put in place to allow payment breaks to be given to mortgage and loan holders at a time when they needed them the most.  When we were facing into this period, we were looking at a public health crisis and an economic emergency.  As a result of the work done by the Department of Finance and me and the work done by the Central Bank and the other banks, in recognition of the huge challenges people were facing, we were able to put in place payment breaks to meet those challenges.<\/p>  <p>  When we are debating the payment breaks, let us take into account that 160,000 of them have been made available to those who needed and deserved them.  Let us recognise that there are 70,000 payment breaks currently in place for mortgage and loan holders who need and deserve support.  Deputy Doherty referred to what was done in Belgium but he did not say that people with savings of more than &euro;25,000 are excluded from the payment break provisions that are available in that country.  He has not touched on the fact that in Germany, the length of the payment break is three months.  There are differences between what is happening in Ireland and what is happening in other parts of Europe.  When we look at what is happening in Belgium, we see that many mortgage holders are excluded from being able to access the payment breaks.  When we look at what is happening in Spain, we see that there are very strict criteria in place - understandable from the point of view of the authorities there - which limit the breaks to a certain group of people on the basis of their income.  What we have done in Ireland is to make mortgage breaks broadly available to those who need them the most.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty asked about the role of the regulator and how these matters were interpreted by central banks in different European countries.  During this period, I was engaging at European level and making the point that we must do all we can to minimise the risk of a further non-performing loan difficulty later in the year.  We needed to avoid a situation  where we would again see people not able to pay their mortgages through no fault of their own and facing the kinds of difficulties we faced in the recent past.  When the Deputy compares what we are doing here with what happens in other countries, he might consider that the type of system we have in place is also different in terms of its breadth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600004#B00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1594892400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We will move on to Question No. 2 in the name of Deputy Paul Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600004#B00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1594892400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Am I not allowed to put another supplementary question to the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600004#B00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1594892400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>No, the Deputy has used up all his time.

The State and its lawyers are now examining the detail of the judgment.

That is the essence of the ruling that \"the Commission did not succeed in showing .... that, by issuing the contested tax rulings, the Irish tax authorities had granted ASI and AOE a selective advantage\".

As such, the Government and the Central Bank have now fulfilled their roles and it is up to both the credit union and social housing sectors to develop any specific funding mechanisms.

I am advised by Revenue that the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in light of the impact of the pandemic, are matters that are outside the remit of the scheme.  The scheme has no role in the employer-employee relationship insofar as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.<\/p><p>The TWSS is provided for under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  Of necessity, the legislation was developed quickly, having regard to the objective of getting financial assistance to employers and employees.  It is predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and retain them until business picks up.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is based on his or her average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020.  However, the employer is expected to make the best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020 for the duration of the scheme.  At the same time, there is no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational systems reasons the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in gross pay when running its payroll. <\/p><p>Finally, details of subsidy payments made by pay date are available to view in each employee&rsquo;s myAccount record on Revenue&rsquo;s online system.  This facility allows employees to see whether their employer is participating in the scheme and being refunded a wage subsidy on their behalf.  Where the amount of subsidy paid is available from the relevant employer payroll submissions made to Revenue, that amount is also displayed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600008#F00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1594894800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Employees can see that and they do not need to the Minister to point them in that direction.

At the end of 2020 Revenue will have all available information for each employee who received TWSS payments.

Revenue will collect any tax owing by reducing an employee's tax credits and rate band so that the liability will be collected evenly during 2021 and, indeed, possibly beyond that.  Alternatively, should an employee wish to pay his or her underpayment in part or in full, he or she can make a payment to settle any underpayment through myAccount.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue will adopt a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the TWSS to avoid any undue hardship on employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600009#G00800","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1594895400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>This is one of the issues we addressed when the scheme was introduced.

They do not know if the underpaid tax will amount to hundreds or thousands of euro at the end of the year.  They have no way of calculating it.  There is no online calculator for the Revenue, which I am suggesting to the Minister today.  Revenue is extremely efficient and excellent in terms of the Revenue Online Service, ROS.

It is important to maintain fairness in how income supports that are being made available for the State are taxed or are not taxed.<\/p>  <p>  To deal with the substantive point the Deputy made, it is a good idea and I will talk to Revenue about it to see if we can provide clarity to individual taxpayers on what their individual circumstances could be.  <\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second question on whether a decision will be made on 2021 and beyond, I imagine the view of the Revenue Commissioner will be that the amount of time the taxpayer has to settle the outstanding liability could vary from taxpayer to taxpayer, depending on his or her circumstances and on the bill.<\/p> <p>Regarding the Deputy's final point, if a person loses his or her job before the end of the year, I imagine that if there is a liability, it will travel with him or her as he or she moves into the next tax year regardless of what his or her job is, but I will double-check that.

It could be substantial, particularly if it is extended.  We also know that those benefitting mostly from the TWSS and the PUP are those in low-income sectors.  Those hit hardest as a result of the pandemic are in hospitality and tourism, where the average income is quite low.  In terms of accommodation and food, for example, their spend is just under &euro;350.  Other sectors, such as retail, are also \/low income.<\/p>  <p>  When these tax liabilities are spread over 2021, it means, in effect, a net wage cut for the employee.  It is a cut in take-home pay because the person's tax liability will be higher.  As the Minister discussed with my colleague earlier, employers are reducing wages as well.  We can see from official figures that a 7% reduction in weekly take-home pay is the average.  There may be a need to consider setting a maximum tax liability that an employee should have to take in a certain month.  We need more clarity on this.  In social welfare, for example, where there is an overpayment, whether it is a mistake by the Department or by the individual, a maximum amount can be deducted from a social welfare.  We need to give certainty to employees that Revenue will not take more than X per week.  Next year we will continue to deal with the pandemic.  This will have an impact on take-home pay.

Some 68% of those jobs are outside of Dublin and in many parts of the country it is the principal source of economic activity.  The sector supports hundreds of thousands of workers, families and communities.  It has been one of the hardest hit sectors as a result of Covid-19 and the facts bear that out.  In recent months, approximately 92% of all workers in the accommodation and food sector have received the pandemic unemployment payment or have been on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  I appreciate that some of these workers have been able to return to work in recent weeks, and that is to be welcomed, but many more have not.<\/p>  <p>  Many publicans and workers in the pub trade are very disappointed with last night's announcement that the planned reopening on Monday will not now be able to proceed.  I appreciate that the decision has not been taken lightly.  I know that public health officials are concerned about increased transmission and possible transmission of Covid-19 at this time.  We must all be guided by the public health advice in the decisions that we take.  However, I think we need to acknowledge that this virus is going to be with us for some time.  It is here for the medium term if not the long term and we need to plan accordingly.  Has any consideration been given by NPHET to varying the approach to reopening in particular regions?  This is an important question.  Is consideration being given to allowing pubs to reopen, like restaurants are open now, with all of the restrictions that are in place in terms of table service, social distancing and time limits but without the serving of food?  The Minister for Health says there is no concern about restaurants, so could pubs do the same but without food?  It strikes me that this could be a way forward in the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we need to look seriously at a specific stimulus plan for the tourism and hospitality sector.  Such a plan is needed.  The T&aacute;naiste may be aware that Sinn F&eacute;in recently published a proposal amounting to a stimulus of &euro;860 million to provide every adult in the State with a voucher worth &euro;200 and every child with a voucher worth &euro;100 to be spent in businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector.  It would provide a big boost to counties and regions heavily dependent on tourism and hospitality as well as supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs.  This plan would also give workers and families a welcome option for a break away or days out after what has been an extraordinarily difficult period.  Similar stimulus plans have been introduced around the world.  Italy has a similar plan to encourage people to holiday at home.  Vienna has given vouchers to residents for restaurants in the city.  The US is distributing billions of dollars in stimulus cheques directly to residents.  This is a worthy investment in terms of jobs in businesses and in communities.  Without that intervention now thousands of jobs could be lost permanently, costing the State considerably more in the long run.  The Government is due to publish its July stimulus plan in the coming days.  Will this scheme or a similar one be considered as part of the package of measures that will be announced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600012#K00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1594897200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I very much agree with Deputy Doherty that the tourism, hospitality and travel sector is a significant part of the economy.  A quarter of a million more people are working in that sector, which is very dependent on travel, both international and domestic.  It is a sector that was hit hardest first and will probably be affected the longest as a result of this pandemic.  While people running pubs and hotels will be very disappointed at the decision the Government took last night they will acknowledge that the decision was taken for good reasons of public health, as Deputy Doherty acknowledged in his contribution.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of how we support these sectors and how we save jobs, different countries will adopt different approaches and when one compares packages one needs to compare them in the round.  For example, in the UK, including Northern Ireland where Deputy Doherty's party is in power, the wage subsidy scheme will come to an end in October and instead something is being done with VAT for one month.  Our approach may be a different one.  We may decide that the best way to protect jobs is to continue the wage subsidy scheme beyond October.  When one talks about what different countries do, one has to look at it in the round.  The focus that we have taken to date is the wage subsidy scheme, because that is the most effective way to keep people in work and it targets those businesses most affected.  We have warehoused tax liabilities and brought in the pandemic unemployment payment for reasons of social solidarity.  In the initial phase of this pandemic we made much greater payments than have been the case in other countries, including north of the Border.  As well as that, we have waived commercial rates for three months.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of what is planned in the July stimulus, that is not decided yet.  It will be decided on Monday, with a view to being published on Tuesday or Wednesday.  We are looking at all sorts of different potential actions and I do not want to speculate on them too much here because that may then raise expectations that cannot be met.  One of the things we are examining is whether the commercial rates waiver should be continued for a longer period.  That saves money for businesses in terms of reducing their costs.  We are also considering whether the wage subsidy scheme should be continued and opened to groups of workers that are not currently covered, such as seasonal workers who were not on the payroll back in February.  In addition, we are considering whether we should do something about the restart grant.  The restart grant has been very beneficial for many businesses, but some did not qualify and, to give the other side of the coin, some correctly pointed out that the restart grant north of the Border is more generous than it is here.

No matter what type of supports we put in we must stimulate demand because 10 million overseas tourists are not coming to the country this year and many of them will not be coming next year.  It will not be possible to replace that demand with domestic consumption but we need to try, and a voucher scheme is a way to do that.  In my view it is a cost-efficient way to do it as 23% of every euro that is spent in the economy in tourism comes back to the State.

Ireland's 190 licensed travel agents are currently watching their businesses fail and, unlike other SMEs, they have received little or no assistance.  I have been in correspondence with the T&aacute;naiste about this issue.  Industry projections estimate that as a result of the advice not to travel abroad, travel agents will lose &euro;120 billion in projected earned income, which comes largely from commissions and service fees.  Without the benefit of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, many travel agents would already have closed their doors as turnover is down by 90%.  All income earned to date from advanced bookings is handed back in refunds, resulting in negative trading.  Advanced bookings are practically at zero so businesses are looking down a black hole toward the rest of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.  Travel agents earn income when consumers pay the balances.  Unlike the domestic tourism industry, they cannot benefit from staycations to any great extent.  Outbound travel agents have no fallback.  However, outbound and inbound tourism rely on each other to generate passengers for airlines to justify operations.  Multinationals and SMEs depend on travel agents to properly manage their costs.  Outbound travel agents also sell European holidays in the UK market and bring meetings, conferences, sports groups and a host of other visitors into Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Travel agents are not arguing against Government advices but they are concerned about the unintended consequences that are putting them in jeopardy.  Greater assistance is urgently required.  Travel agents were excluded from applying for the online retail scheme in the first round of grants as they were considered to be providing a leisure service.  Travel agents should not be excluded from the upcoming round of financial supports for SMEs or from applying for certain grants that may evolve due to a misconception about the volume and type of business they provide.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the Government advice is not to travel.  Thousands of people have followed that advice by cancelling holidays.  Most of these cancellations are package holidays that include flights, transfers and accommodation.  We have a ludicrous situation where under a EU directive the travel agent is legally responsible for the refund of the entire package.  This is simply not sustainable financially.  It is a travesty and incredibly unfair to expect travel agents to shoulder the burden of this financial outlay.  It will force them into liquidation.  Ironically, the travel agent bonding system to protect consumers when agencies collapse only becomes active and effective after a travel agency goes into liquidation.  Travel agents, and thousands of consumers across Ireland are stranded between a EU directive and Government travel advice.  This matter requires urgent attention and correction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600013#L00100","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1594897800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I had a chance to speak briefly to the president of the Irish Travel Agents Association, ITAA, on a Zoom call the other day.

We all know these businesses and they are largely locally-owned, often family-owned.  They tend to be an important feature on our high streets.

We want to make sure that they survive and that they are able to do well again when we get past this pandemic.  They benefit from the actions already put in place by Government including, for example, the wage subsidy scheme.  Almost all of them would benefit from that because their turnover has gone down by so much.  We also brought in the refund credit note scheme so that people would get vouchers or credit notes rather than cash refunds in an effort to assist the sector so that it did not collapse, although people are ultimately entitled to the cash if that is what they want.

I can understand what a hammer blow this news is for publicans and for people who run pubs, nightclubs and other venues, who had expected and hoped they would be able to open next Monday.  I do not think I am the only person in the House who was looking forward to freedom pints next week but, unfortunately, this is not possible.  It is not possible for a good reason, which is that the incidence of the virus in Ireland has increased.  It is still very low, at roughly 20 cases at day at four per 100,000, which is the eighth or ninth lowest out of 31 countries in Europe, but the trajectory was a matter of concern.  It was going in the wrong direction.<\/p>  <p>  This has not been largely due to international travel despite all the focus on it.  It has been 90% due to our own behaviours, with people in close contact with one another in confined indoor spaces breathing on one another, coughing on one another and touching one another, and as a result of this we have seen a number of clusters, often linked to house parties and social engagements.  This is a matter of concern and this is why NPHET gave the Government the advice it did and the Government acted on it, which was to defer the opening of pubs and nightclubs at least until 10 August and bring in new rules on house parties, which is to say that people should not invite more than ten people to their house and from no more than four households.  This is the advice.<\/p>  <p>  We know from all over the world, and from China and Asia, that it is not outdoor gatherings, for example like what happened in Dame Lane, which should not have happened, where the virus spreads but it is in indoor small confined spaces with ten or 15 people passing it to each other through close contact and being together for a prolonged period of time.  This is house parties and small pubs, unfortunately.  That is the truth of it.  It is also potentially restaurants, if restaurants act as if they are pubs and concentrate more on selling alcohol rather than people having a meal with a bit of alcohol and getting out within an hour and a half.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600014#M00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1594898400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

We are not saying they will open on 10 August, we are saying they will open no sooner than 10 August and it will depend on the numbers and how the virus behaves, to use Tony Holohan's term, between now and then.  When we published the plan, and I was the one who published it as Taoiseach at the time, to reopen business and society, we made it very clear on day one that it was a plan that could be accelerated if things were going in the right direction, paused if things were going off-line and reversed if needed to be.  We were always upfront about that from day one.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the help we can offer the pubs to open when they do reopen, the wage subsidy scheme is in place and we intend to extend it.  They do not have to pay commercial rates and we are looking at whether we can extend this also.  They will benefit from the restart grant.

We all agree on this.  I want to ask what businesses will be expected to do for the State in return for all of the support the State is giving to them.  It is a two-way street and it is not simply enough that they come out of the crisis in reasonable shape.  The State must also be in reasonable shape.  In return for the support we, as the State, are giving to them they need to support the workers who make their businesses a success.  I do not believe a business can survive without the support of its workforce.  Indeed, it is the workforce that makes many businesses viable.  It is not simply through supporting entrepreneurs or business people that we will recover; it is also by supporting workers and linking the survival of workers and their families to the success of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Too often in recent weeks, as people have returned to work, I have heard stories of businesses using the crisis to reduce wages without consultation.  In one business, management has made many people redundant and is availing of the wage subsidy scheme for the remainder of employees.  It is also using the crisis to reduce the remaining wages by 10% for everybody across the board, for which workers are already getting the wage subsidy.  In another employment, management has taken on a new policy whereby all the workers return to work on the wage subsidy alone.  While this may be okay, as the T&aacute;naiste has said to me previously, it is a betrayal of workers and the State.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get to a new way of thinking in this country, whereby we can acknowledge that business is important for the success of the economy but an engaged workforce is important for the success of business.  This is key.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Government can make this happen.  After all, I know the T&aacute;naiste has the well-being of our people at heart.  My question is simple.  Will the T&aacute;naiste make the jobs stimulus package work for workers also and ensure they, as well as their employment, will be able to survive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600014#M01400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1594898400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The answer to the question is \"Yes\".  If he looks at what we have done so far, I announced a package of approximately &euro;12 billion to respond to the coronavirus.  This is leaving aside the health costs.  This approximately &euro;12 billion is for supports for business and employees.  Not all of this has been drawn down yet but the bulk of it that has been drawn down is the wage subsidy scheme, which subsidises the wages of workers, and the pandemic unemployment payment, which provides a welfare payment to people who have been laid off.  The vast majority of the money we have spent so far has been targeted at people who have lost their jobs or people whose jobs only exist now because they are being subsidised.<\/p>  <p>The amount we have given to business in grants and loans is much less than that.  In fact, I believe we need to do better in terms of the grants and loans we give to business, and we intend to do that next week.  The focus has been on people who have lost their jobs and ensuring that more people do not lose their jobs.<\/p> <p> Businesses do a great deal for us already.  They create much employment and they pay a large amount of tax.  We are able to fund our education, health and justice systems, as well as public infrastructure and everything else, from all the taxes businesses pay.  I might be wrong about this and there may be exceptions but I do not believe there are many employers in this country who are taking advantage of this crisis to reduce people's wages or terms and conditions.  There might be examples and we must expose and tackle those people, but in the vast majority of cases where employers are seeking pay reductions it is because they have no choice.  Their business is down 50%, 60% or 70% and they will be in a loss making position this year.  Part of what they must do to survive is reduce their costs, and it is very regrettable when that has to happen.  However, it has to be better than the business failing and all those people being laid off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600014#M01500","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594899000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste, but people staying at work for wages on which they and their families cannot survive is not good for them either.

When a business is closed it does not pay any VAT.  The best thing we can do to help pubs and other businesses that have not reopened to reopen over the coming weeks is to go back to doing what we have done really well as a country for a couple of months now, that is, social distancing, handwashing, sneezing and coughing into a tissue, keeping a reasonable distance from other people and wearing masks on public transport and in crowded indoor spaces.

Since 2016, when the previous Government's housing strategy, Rebuilding Ireland, was introduced, rents across the State have increased by an astonishing 40%.  The average asking rent across the State is now &euro;1,400 per month.  The situation is much worse in Dublin, with rents increasing by an astonishing 70% over the same period and an average asking rent in the city and county of &euro;2,000 per month.  It is &euro;7,500 a year more expensive to rent in Dublin today than when Rebuilding Ireland was launched.<\/p><p>While Covid-19 has shifted the focus of the debate to emergency measures to protect renters, the deeper structural problems remain.  Research by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, shows that 70% of workers among the lowest 25% of earners have high housing costs, paying up to 40% of their take-home pay in rent.  These people are not eligible for the housing assistance payment, HAP, or other rental supports.  Even for those who can access such social housing supports, the impact of high rents means top-up payments are required in addition to the differential rent to the local authority.  For example, the difference between HAP rates in Dublin and market rents is now &euro;700 a month for a family and an astonishing &euro;900 a month for a single person.  The impact of high rents on people is immense.  They have to choose, in some instances, between rent, heat and food.  They have to work longer hours or, in some cases, get a second job.  They must put off having children or buying a home and they are unable to save towards a deposit or for a rainy day.  On the very hardest edge, high rents are increasing poverty and forcing some families and single people into homelessness.<\/p><p>We urgently need the Government to extend the Covid-related ban on rent increases.  Given the significant anxiety among renters and landlords across the State, it is astonishing that the Cabinet made a decision in this regard yesterday but has yet to announce it.  We also need to deal with the underlying problem of high rents.  The Bill seeks to ban all rent increases for existing and new tenancies for a period of three years.  Its provisions would apply to existing tenancies at the rate they are currently being charged and to all new tenancies on the basis of the Residential Tenancies Board rent index for the relevant area and property size.  The ban will be reviewed annually and automatically expire at the end of three years.<\/p> <p>As we have said previously, if Sinn F&eacute;in were in government, we would complement this measure with a refundable tax credit putting a month's rent back in every renter's pocket, as well as a major investment in affordable cost-rental accommodation on public land with rents of between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month.<br\/><br\/>When we introduced similar legislation at the end of the previous D&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael said it would deter future investment and that it would be unconstitutional.  Institutional investment in the private rental sector benefits from record high rents and excessively generous tax breaks, and preventing rents from increasing any further would have no impact on current levels of investment.  Restrictive interpretations of the Constitution are too often used as a fig leaf by a Government that does not have the political will to act.  While the Government is correct to take the advice of the Attorney General, it should also listen to the country's leading constitutional law experts.  When the Government claimed our previous Bill was unconstitutional, Dr. David Kenny, who is an assistant professor of law at Trinity College Dublin and one of the authors of the country's leading textbooks on the Constitution, stated:<\/p><blockquote>\t... there is an argument that the rent freeze bill violates constitutional property rights, but it is not at all clear that this argument would succeed.<br \/><br \/>There is a good chance that, in deference to the Oireachtas&rsquo; judgment and the scale of the housing crisis, that the courts would uphold the Bill.<br \/><br \/>Indeed, I cannot think of any Supreme Court precedent on property rights in the last 20 years that would suggest the courts would invalidate a measure such as the one under discussion. <\/blockquote> <p>Further, Dr. Rachael Walsh, who is also an assistant professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, said that &quot;where a clear objective is identifiable for a restriction on the exercise of property rights that plausibly secures the common good and social justice and is procedurally fair, there is every chance of such legislation surviving constitutional challenge&quot;.  Ultimately, the courts would decide the matter, so the real question is whether the Government has the political will to stand up for renters and go all the way to the courts to protect them from excessive rents.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is reasonable, proportionate, fair and, most important, absolutely necessary to protect hundreds of thousands of hard-pressed renters.  I commend the Bill to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600018#Q00900","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594901400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600019#R00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1594901400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600019#R00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1594901400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1594901400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600019#R00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1594901400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600019#R00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1594901400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1594901400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 1.52 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1594901700,"counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600020#V00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1594901700,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1594901700,"counter":221,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1594901700,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 11 to 16, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.

There are two issues regarding these amendments.  First, I believe that air quality must be included as part of the remit of the climate action fund.  Any of us who understand the issues of climate change will appreciate that air quality is the practical, here-and-now aspect of climate change.  By improving air quality in the short term, we can have a long-term impact on overall emissions.  There has been a narrative to try to disassociate those two objectives and to suggest that air quality and climate action are the opposite sides of the same coin.  While there is much media attention and discussion online regarding climate change, there is very little concerning air pollution, because we do not actually see it.<\/p><p>The facts are that four people die every day in Ireland as a result of poor air quality and 122,000 bed nights every year are occupied by people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  In fact, one in 12 people in Ireland have COPD, one in five children in Ireland has asthma and Ireland has the fourth highest incidence of asthma globally.  It is important, therefore, that this legislation clearly reflects the objective of improving air quality, which has a direct impact on our climate emissions.  When the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is responding, he might outline when we will see the clean air strategy.  As he will know from the files in his Department, the first draft of that strategy was being completed in September 2018 and yet, bizarrely, it seems to have gone down the priority list within the Department.  The Minister might update us on that aspect.<\/p><p>In addition, when the Minister is updating me, he might let me know where the warmth and well-being research that was being conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is.  It was due to provide the Department with a preliminary report in September 2018.  I noticed from a recent parliamentary reply that the report is still ongoing, which seems bizarre to me.  I do not believe that the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is that incompetent that two years later we still do not have the preliminary report.  Having access to that information is significant for the decisions we are going to make as a country.  Anecdotal information from the warmth and well-being pilot is showing that people are more comfortable in their own homes, are getting sick less often, are presenting to their GPs less often, are being prescribed antibiotics less frequently, are presenting to hospitals less often, are having shorter stays in hospital and are being discharged more frequently directly to their own homes rather than to step-down facilities.  This research has huge potential regarding improving health outcomes in this country, but it seems to have evaporated.<\/p><p>The second element to my amendment concerns carbon sequestration, which, bizarrely, is not included in the legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, referred last night to the just transition, Bord na M&oacute;na workers, rehabilitating bogs and biodiversity.  That is all carbon sequestration, yet it is not included in this legislation.  I note that in last week's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>there was a leak regarding the submission that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made to the European Commission.  The document refers to incentivising carbon sequestration measures and better management of our wetlands and peatlands and making that a key priority.  One of the things the climate action fund could do is to spearhead research in this area to come up with some innovative solutions.  To date, that has not been forthcoming from organisations such as Teagasc.  The climate action fund could help to spearhead innovation in that area.<\/p><p>There is another aspect of sequestration that I believe the climate action fund also needs to spearhead.<\/p> <p>Again, that is not happening from Teagasc.  We all accept that Ireland has one of the best grass production systems in the world.  We should be focused on the development of new grass-based solutions to meet our current and future food needs as well as our energy needs.  To date the research community has been behind the curve in that regard.<\/p> <p> In the 1970s some of my family worked in Gowla Farms outside Ballyforan in my constituency in County Galway.  The farm was producing food for pigs and poultry from dried grass.  Yet, that industry has now evaporated.  There were financial reasons for that but surely it is not beyond our research community to come up with innovative products derived from grass.<\/p> <p> While I am on the issue of grass-based systems I am keen to put on the record that disadvantaged land types in this country, especially in the west of Ireland, remove carbon from our atmosphere and convert it into human protein on land that is not suitable for tillage.  The argument is being made that we need to move away from beef production and start growing crops.  Yet, the reality is a farmer could not go 20 yards with a plough before it would be in ribbons because of the type of land we have.  The Acting Chairman knows this well given the nature of many parts of her constituency.  Beef production is a way of utilising the land, sequestering carbon and converting it into human protein.  Let us look at new research in this area. The climate action fund could be the driver of that innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600020#V00500","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594902000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600021#W00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1594902000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Whitmore not come in first?

The theme is essentially that we need to incorporate nature-based solutions into our climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.  There has been a real gap to date and that gap is reflected in this Bill as well.  It is a wasted opportunity because it fails to recognise the value of nature-based solutions and what they can add not only from a climate mitigation and adaptation perspective but also in the sense of the bang for our buck we get with it.  Essentially, it will also provide major biodiversity services as well.<\/p>  <p>  When we are taking about nature-based solutions we mean using kelp beds as a carbon storage facility.  People are aware of the carbon storage potential of trees but they are not aware that sea grasses have major potential as well.  We need to start protecting and enhancing these options to assist in climate action and from a biodiversity perspective.<\/p>  <p>  Many things that happen as a result of climate change like flooding are the effects we will feel but they can be mitigated by using nature.  Essentially, nature is the tool that I believe will give us most effect when it comes to this.  Let us consider the case of flooding.  Rather than the first port of call being to pick up a digger and cement and build a big sea wall, we should look upstream to see what works we can provide there.  Can we plant in different ways?  Can we provide flood plain areas and manage them?  Our nature, rivers and seas are dynamic systems and we need to learn to work with them rather than against them.  We will never win the fight if we work against them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will see a theme throughout each of my amendments.  We need to incorporate nature-based systems into how we deal with climate change.  The Bill does not do that.  I hope the Minister will take that on board and incorporate them somehow.  If we do not specify or spell them out in the Bill, there is a risk that by precluding them it will seem they are not to be utilised at all.  This is important when we look at our technological responses to climate change.  Obviously they play a major part and will be important in how we address it.  We also need to spell out the nature-based solutions that can help as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600021#W00900","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1594902000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am sorry if I was changing the order there in a sense.  I apologise because I was unable to be in the Chamber for the Second Stage debate last night.  It clashed with a Cabinet meeting that I had to attend.  I was liaising with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I gather it was a good debate.  I hope we can continue that today.<\/p>  <p>  There is a critical timeline with this debate.  The sooner we pass the legislation, the sooner we will be able to draw down funding for some of the solutions that we are going to discuss.  That is the critical reason we are pressing ahead.  I cannot remember the exact amount but every additional month will provide &euro;10 million that we can bring towards the solutions that we all agree are needed.  That affects the timelines.  I mention this because it also affects our ability to accept amendments.  I will not be able to accept the amendments set out.  However, I am hoping to discuss how we may be able to pick up some of the amendments in a climate Bill due later this Autumn.  We are not ruling out the prospect of taking on board some of the ideas mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  I will start by explaining why these amendments are not being accepted and why they have been grouped together.  They are concerned with expanding the scope of the climate action fund, including providing for it to have the ability to support projects which improve air quality and biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies Naughten and Whitmore for their positive amendments on these project types and for including carbon sequestration projects under the projects supported by the fund.  I agree with them that measures in these areas are important.  However, I am reluctant to expand further the range of project types that may be supported by what is already likely to be a heavily over-subscribed fund.  To do so would risk diluting the fund's impact across a large range of sectors and areas, rather than the fund being targeted for maximum impact, primarily towards greenhouse gas reductions.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, my Department held information briefings which were attended by a large number of groups and potential project promoters interested in applying to the fund for support.  A subsequent expression of interest process indicated that the fund was likely to attract a large number of developed and worthwhile projects.  For this reason I think it is wise not to amend the Bill to enable climate action fund support for measures to improve air quality and biodiversity, notwithstanding the fact that it is necessary to promote and support measures in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment the Bill limits the projects that can be supported to those which will impact on the State's ability to meet its greenhouse gas emissions' targets and those that provide help to workers and regions that are impacted by the State's transition to a low carbon economy.  The provisions for the fund included within the Bill are targeted at certain activities which can be directly linked to Government targets and obligations, such as national and international climate and energy targets as well as providing assistance to communities as they transition from a dependency on high carbon activities.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to refer in particular to amendment No. 11 from Deputy Naughten.  While not accepting the amendment now, I thank the Deputy for what I believe is a positive and constructive amendment.  Deputies will be aware that measures to promote carbon sequestration relating to how we conduct forestry and manage soils offer extraordinary potential to increase the natural storage of carbon.<\/p>  <p>  A land use review will be undertaken in due course by Government.  It will include forests, farmlands and peatlands to ensure that future decisions and policy formation are informed by consideration of how land may best be used.  This will take into account carbon sequestration benefits as well as climate adaptation.  There is scope to consider further if and how the climate fund can support sequestration projects, initiatives and research and I will examine this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that as part of the programme for Government I will shortly be progressing the climate action Bill through the Oireachtas.  I think there could be scope for this Bill, after a closer consideration of relevant issues, to provide for the climate action fund to support carbon sequestration projects in the State and also potentially for projects to improve climate resilience.  I note that Deputy Whitmore has referred to the fund supporting community based transition solutions in amendment No. 16.  Again, I will look at what can be done within the climate action Bill possibly to amend funding capabilities.  I agree absolutely with Deputy Whitmore that addressing the climate crisis has to go hand in hand with addressing the biodiversity crisis.<\/p> <p>The two go together.  A lot of the solutions we will use to fight climate change will inherently provide benefits for biodiversity, depending on the type of forestry we do.  If we go with close to nature continuous coverage forestry solutions, we will see significant improvements in biodiversity, as well as the delivery of high-quality timber, the creation of a significant number of jobs and the development of rural Ireland.  I could go on.  The land use plan is critical so that we address biodiversity and the climate crisis at the same time. <\/p> <p> The former Minister, Deputy Naughten, has a deep knowledge of this area given his former role in the Department.  I agree with him that the air quality issue is also connected.  The two go together.  As we move away from fossil fuel use, that will provide potential benefits in terms of addressing air quality.  I am trying to remember my briefing notes on this area, but my understanding is that the air quality review is due to be published shortly or is close to being completed.  <\/p> <p> My knowledge of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine report is, I am afraid, much more scant.  I will ask the Department to dig up that body of work.  I thank the Deputy for reminding me of its existence.  I will track it down and report back to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600021#W01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594902600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify something for Deputies Naughten and Whitmore and myself.

This money is in a bank account.  He tried to insinuate that if we do not introduce this legislation, the &euro;10 million a month in the account might be lost.  It will not be.

In rejecting the amendments I have put forward, the Minister is excluding valuable opportunities to improve air quality and health outcomes for people. <\/p>  <p>  The historic approach we took on legislation in the House before Covid-19 has to change dramatically.  A pandemic is spreading across the world which specifically targets vulnerable people with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease or asthma.  The Bill provides us with an opportunity to hit two birds with one stone.  We could improve air quality and reduce our overall emissions, as well as improving health outcomes and protecting our population against Covid-19.  I cannot understand why the Minister is rejecting the air quality amendment I have put forward.<\/p>  <p>  Another of my amendments deals with carbon sequestration.  The growing of grass in this country provides significant opportunities that are far less controversial than planting regions of the west of Ireland with trees.  Irish farmers are, thanks to our atmosphere, good at growing grass.  Can we do some research into examining how we can utilise grass in this country to sequester carbon and create a sustainable income for some farmers?  Surely that is something that would benefit our overall climate targets.  This type of investment and research is not happening through traditional mechanisms.  It will only happen if the climate action fund drives that forward.  My amendment is required to make that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600022#X00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1594902600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Are we dealing with Deputy Naughten's amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600022#X00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1594902600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>We are discussing amendment Nos. 1 and 11 to 16, inclusive.

The Social Democrats said all along that we would be very constructive in opposition and that if there was an opportunity to work with the Government to get things done, we would be more than happy to do that.  This is the first time I have put forward an amendment.  <\/p>  <p>  The amendments I am putting forward are simple ideas that are internationally recognised.  As it would appear that the Minister also recognises the need for them, I am surprised that such simple concepts and amendments are not being incorporated into the Bill.  I do not think that saying there is an issue because of time limitations is appropriate.  This Bill will be in operation for quite some time and will direct and dictate where significant moneys will be targeted.  At this stage, not to incorporate these very simple amendments is a real opportunity lost. <\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Naughten said, we should not decide to fund, for example, a technological project without asking what the end result of it will be and its impact on climate emissions.  We should be targeting those areas.  The process should be competitive and we should expect the absolute best projects and results for our environment.  The way the fund is currently structured means that will not happen. <\/p>  <p>  To preclude any mention of biodiversity or nature in the Bill is symbolic and says we will continue with business as usual and silo those two issues.  We will have electric vehicles and a technological response to climate change on the one hand, and on the other a biodiversity crisis to which we gave lip service last year because we declared a crisis that we are still not going to address.  Very little funding is directed at addressing biodiversity, apart from very local projects.<\/p>  <p>  Money is going towards pollinator plans, which are great but will not address the huge crisis facing this country, Europe and the planet.  We have to put our money where our mouth and research is and where the science tells us it needs to go.  That is not happening and, ultimately, the Bill will not achieve that unless we incorporate nature-based solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600022#X00475","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1594902600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I am delighted with the Minister's appointment.  I wish him well in his portfolio and look forward to working with him.  T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre.  He has rejected these amendments.  Deputy Naughten's amendments are very wisely thought out.  He understands this area because he was in the Minister's seat.  I thank him for all of the engagement he had with us when he was in office.  I hope all Ministers will engage with the different groupings and all Deputies in D&aacute;il because we are elected to this House for a good reason, namely, to look after the public and all of the issues, including climate.<\/p>  <p>  A lot of money has been collected in recent years from schemes, such as the &euro;209 million collected from the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  A lot of carbon tax has been collected.  People have been taxed and taxed but have seen no tangible benefits.  That is why I am worried that the Bill will mean more taxes being imposed on the same people, especially those in rural Ireland.  Some of the major projects that have been earmarked are city based.  I have nothing against cities, but if people are paying taxes we need to bring them with us.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p> <p>Daoine &oacute;ga, young people, in particular, have shown they are interested, worried and concerned but the farming community cannot be scapegoated.  Deputy Naughten is right about planting huge swathes of land because once the land, which could be good land, is planted - I have seen this happen close to where I live - it is very hard to return it to arable land even after harvesting 40 years later.<\/p> <p> I heard an excellent programme, \"CountryWide\", on the radio on Saturday morning.  Deputy Naughten might know the family who were on the programme because they were from Roscommon.  They had a wonderful concept.  They were doing an amount of work for biodiversity.  It was a mixed enterprise or farm with some trees and briars, bushes, holly and ivy.  The land naturally developed.  They also had sheep which grazed on garlic and herbs and they said the butcher was always seeking their lambs.  That is a way to ensure farm to fork and to ensure people want quality assured meat.  People vote with their feet when they go to buy it.  It was a wonderful enterprise.<\/p> <p> I am disappointed that it is going this way, especially with a majority Government.  We saw this at the Business Committee today and we see it at the D&aacute;il reform committee.  The Minister has to get support, involvement and acceptance for these green concepts.  It has always been the Minister's thing, and fair dues to him, but he must bring people with him in respect of the Bill.  He is not willing to accept amendments.  He said the Bill is rushed but every piece of legislation we have done in this term has been rushed.  Perhaps we should leave some of it until we come back after the recess in six weeks' time and get it right.  At the Business Committee this morning, we gave permission to waive pre-legislative scrutiny on a number of Bills.  No committees have been set up to discuss legislation.  We saw that happen yesterday when I was in the Chair.  It was difficult because we had not had the committee debate and we ran into huge problems.  Legislation that is rushed is poor legislation.  I appeal to the Minister to get down and dirty with the Deputies, accept some of the amendments and try to engage with Deputies.  Promising that there will be another Bill in which he might involve them or on which he might engage with them is not the same thing.  We must start as we mean to go on.  The Minister must accept amendments.

It is disappointing the Minister is not taking the amendments on board.  I do not accept the strength of his argument against taking them on board.  That in and of itself is disappointing.  As others have said, there is an opportunity in this Bill to make a very significant impact and significant change.  I agree we need to reframe our structures and need a paradigm shift in terms of how we engage with the issue of climate action.  We need to bring people with us but we also need to reframe our structures and move away from the idea that it is about technological solutions and essentially generate a climate action industry.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments proposed by Deputies Whitmore and Naughten aim to strengthen the Bill.

My colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, will deal with it in the Seanad.  Tabling an amendment in the Seanad rather than here is an indication that this Bill is being rushed to a degree.

I refer to much of the land in the west, in particular.  In my opinion the farmers are carbon neutral.  They have cattle on two or three acres or a cow with two or three acres to herself for the simple reason that the quality of the land is not as good.  Research needs to be done to make sure we know what we are talking about.  I am worried about what the Minister spoke about in terms of land use.  I would like him to elaborate further on that for the simple reason that there are private property rights in this country.  There is a big worry that his party and the new Government have an agenda from Donegal to Clare to the River Shannon, and even to a few of the counties beyond.  The Minister spoke about trees earlier.  Under an environmental scheme, and I have talked about this, one could put 500 or 1,000 trees on half an acre but one cannot blacken areas.  There are other ways in which carbon can be sequestered.  Have we done research on grass?  The answer is \"No\".  Dr. Frank Mitloehner has done it in California and has shown they have sequestered more than what they put out.<\/p>  <p>  We need to make sure a certain part of the country is not burdened with all this.  I read an article yesterday in which the Minister said he wanted to go to a &euro;100 carbon tax.  The people who will be paying the carbon tax are those who are living in the areas that will be trying to sequester as much as possible for the benefit of the country.<\/p> <p>That is what I worry about.  I worry that the Minister will cripple the people who do not have public transport and who have the small farms in the rural areas with a massive &euro;100 a tonne.  Socially and economically, such people may not have the advantages because of unbalanced regional development and at the same time are expected to suck it up and be the sequesters for the rest of the country.<\/p> <p> I worry about the term \"land use\".  While Europe might have different property rights, Ireland has found out in the past few days, with its so-called strategic areas of conservation, SACs, that it is being brought to court because it had not actually made them into SACs.  We have to protect the property rights of people as well.  Let Europe have its own types of property rights.  We have to respect, do the research and reward those farmers in those areas but at the same time not burden them with everything because they have to be able to work the land as well.  There are many people talking about sequestering carbon and how we will do it.  The managers of the land are the farmers throughout the country and one has to bring them on board and respect them because otherwise, one is not going anywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600023#Y00600","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594903800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>First, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his new position.  This is my first time speaking here before him.  I wish him the very best.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke here last night in detail about the amendment and the worries I have, coming from a rural constituency.  It is my belief that it is tax.  It is a climate action fund but my worry is it is a tax on the people of rural Ireland.  I was not trying to be negative.  I was trying to look at ways forward.<\/p>  <p>  I have a different Minister before me today but, as I said, we have raised the critical issue of our natural gas.  I spoke last night about the security of supply situation, which I consider to be dire.  As the Minister wishes to increase energy efficiency under the proposed amendments for the climate action fund, I believe we need to get our house in order first.<\/p>  <p>  While Ireland has an agency to safeguard a minimum level of oil reserves, it has become increasingly clear to me that Ireland is severely exposed.  At present, there are security of supply issues in relation to our natural gas.  As the Minister may have noted in the news recently, the Kinsale gas platform, one of our only indigenous sources of national gas supply, was recently turned off.  This will result in a loss of local jobs in Cork.  It also means that we are now in an extremely vulnerable position with regard to our national security of supply of gas.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland currently produces more than 50% of its electricity from gas and we import gas via the interconnectors from the UK.  We have no existing gas storage on the island of Ireland.  The Corrib gas field will be gone within ten years and we are now fully reliant on the UK for gas imports.  The UK is also reliant on gas imports and has experienced its own decline in gas production in the North Sea.  The UK is also exiting the EU, meaning new risks to our economy.  While the UK and Ireland are good friends, now the same cannot exactly be said of the EU and the UK, which are going through a messy divorce at present.  If trade talks between the EU and the UK were to take a turn for the worse, there is not much preventing the British national grid operator from increasing tariffs on the interconnectors between the EU and the UK which would, in turn, directly hurt the Irish economy.  I, therefore, strongly ask the Minister to improve our security of supply situation for natural gas.  I propose that the Minister consider at the very minimum a floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, import terminal in Cork, which could guarantee our security of supply while developing offshore wind power and renewables.  I am aware of a company here, which has a decent plan.  I understand the Minister is dealing with many issues.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is in a new Ministry.  While the Minister has great capabilities, I respect the fact that there is a bit of pressure.  There are other issues going on at present.  However, I would like to sit down with the Minister and go through the potential of a floating LNG regasification terminal in Cork.  Without me speaking for the next five or ten minutes, the Minister might give me some indication that he might be interested in listening to such a proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600024#Z00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1594903800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I will address each question in turn.

Maybe I was not clear to Deputies Whitmore and Naughten.  I was not saying \"No\" to all the amendments, in the sense that specifically, there is sense behind amendment No. 11 and Deputy Whitmore's amendment No. 16.  I see merit in what has been suggested there.  What I intend to do is to come back in the drafting of the climate action Bill to see if we can incorporate it and amend, and that way we would still have access to that additional &euro;10 million for climate action and could use it on some of the measures that the Deputies have suggested, which would be a real benefit, I hope, to what the Deputies are intending to do.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy O'Rourke and the amendment in the Seanad, the Deputy is absolutely right that we must be careful here that this is not a political fund in the sense it has to go for climate action.  A competitive tendering fund is the approach in order that people would bid in and across the different areas, so that there are various people who could apply for it.  There is a particular category that we may wish to support, particularly supporting the action that Bord na M&oacute;na, for example, might take in terms of rehabilitation bogs and lands for which it has responsibility.  In those cases, it would be less competitive, in the sense that Bord na M&oacute;na is the single entity with that responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  The Attorney General recommended a slight variation - a technical amendment - which is what we are putting forward in the Seanad tomorrow to recognise that that is slightly different and to copper-fasten and absolutely nail down and protect it to make sure it is subject to no legal challenge.  That slight variation, in terms of the funding to support Bord na M&oacute;na, would need a variation in the Bill.  Under the rules for technical amendments one needs a certain period of time to be able to put it forward, and putting it forward in the Seanad enables us to do that.  Then we will return to the D&aacute;il and if the D&aacute;il agrees it, the Bill is passed.  I would say I have found in the experience of legislating that the Seanad has that critical role and allows us to have a second House in be able to amend in that way.  That is why I am happy to do it.  I hope Sinn F&eacute;in in the Seanad will be able to support it tomorrow.  I look forward to discussing with Senator Boylan the reason for that.  Hopefully, similarly, Deputies will support it when it comes back here.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Mattie McGrath, and, indeed, Deputy Fitzmaurice and others, and this relates to what Deputy Naughten is saying about grassland management if I could maybe come back to that, the Deputy is absolutely right that there is real potential for us in how we manage our grasslands to help tackle climate change.  There are certain areas, uplands, let us say, peaty boglands, where grazing cattle and sheep provide climate benefits because in the absence of the cattle grazing, one would see natural birch vegetation coming back up which would drain the peaty soils which would release carbon.  There is no one here wagging fingers or telling any farmer what he is doing is wrong and what another is doing is right.<\/p> <p>Farmers, particularly those working more marginal lands in the north and west, are some of the best and most important people with regard to protecting and looking after nature.  We need to stop shaming them as part of the climate story.  That shaming is not coming from here.  If it is, I hope Deputies will pull me up on it because it is not the true story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600024#Z01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594904400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Some Green Party members are involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600025#AA00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1594904400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>They may well be but I will account for Green Party policy in this area.  We absolutely have to work hand in hand with those farmers, who are important custodians of the land.  We must also pay them properly.  The land use plan will not involve going down to the level of individual farmers and telling them to do this, that or the other because, to be honest, they are best placed to know how to manage the land.  They know the land and what happens on it better than anyone in an office in Brussels, Dublin or anywhere else possibly could.  In those Dublin offices, however, we have the responsibility to shape the support mechanisms and income supports to ensure that tens of thousands of young farmers will continue the proud tradition of Irish family farms and of people managing and protecting the land.  The expansion of the CAP fund is being discussed in the European Council as we speak this afternoon.  Everyone at that level is saying that nature must be looked after in what we are doing because we have a biodiversity crisis and a climate crisis.  This land use plan is absolutely in the interests of, and to the benefit of, family farms, particularly in the north, west and south west of the country.  It will help to deliver the income that will give them a future and opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to amendment No. 11, we should absolutely look at measures being developed with regard to carbon sequestration not only in the implementation of this fund, but in other ways as well.  There is a stimulus package to be launched next week.  I would love to see money in that to help Bord na M&oacute;na or others to manage our bogs.  The rewetting of bogs under the land use plan is critical.  That will allow us to store carbon and to prevent its future release through bog fires.  It will also help to restore biodiversity.  Deputy Whitmore is absolutely right when she says it is probably one of the best ways to improve water quality, restore biodiversity and tackle carbon emissions.  We must fund that not only through this climate fund, but through other mechanisms as well because the scale of what we need to do is beyond compare.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to accepting amendments, Deputy Whitmore's amendment No. 16 has real merit because this has to come from the bottom up.  It has to be community-led.  This is not about big business or big anything else.  It has to be about local communities having a connection to and involvement in this.  This is why I believe amendment No. 16 has particular merit and why I would love to include it in the climate Bill.  That would give us an extra &euro;10 million to put into such projects, which is why I propose doing it in that way.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins referred to LNG.  The &euro;1.85 trillion investment plan at which Europe is looking rightly says that the fuel of the future will be green hydrogen.  This is only starting and will take some time to evolve and develop but we have a huge competitive advantage comparatively because we are one of the windiest places in the world.  This Government is going to aim for 70% of our electricity to be generated by renewables, where we have a real competitive advantage.  This supports what the previous Government did and what was agreed by the Oireachtas joint committee and by all of us across the board.  We will particularly focus on offshore generation.  Floating offshore technology is coming down in price and our wind speeds are very high.  The environment is tough but in Galway, Kerry, Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Clare we can turn to this resource to create wealth for our country.<\/p>  <p>  If, in the ten years it will take us to start building this network capable of generating 30 GW from offshore wind, the price comes down as expected, and as it consistently has over the last 20 or 30 years as the technology has evolved, we can use that power to create green hydrogen through electrolysis.  This would be stored in and shipped from locations like Cork Harbour or the Shannon Estuary, where there is deep water and a sheltered space close to the energy source, the offshore wind farms.  This is a big investment - we are talking tens of billions - but it is absolutely in tune with what everyone is now saying.  As I read it, international energy experts believe this is where investment and technology are going and this is what the momentum is towards.  We happen to have a huge comparative competitive advantage because of our level of wind, our location and our safe harbours.<\/p>  <p>  I will absolutely meet Deputy Michael Collins at Cork Harbour, but when I meet him there I will tell him we should be developing facilities for green hydrogen.  Fossil fuels are of the past.  We have to stop using them because our climate is threatened.  Green hydrogen is the future.  It will provide jobs and an energy supply that is competitive and clean and which will mean our children and their children will have a safe and secure economic future.  That is what we need to do.  This fund may help to start some of that.  The &euro;500 million to &euro;700 million we raise over the next few years will not fund the whole thing.  It is only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the investment we need to make.  That investment needs to be made in the west, including the south west and north west, in particular because that is where the energy resource is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600025#AA00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1594904400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The fact is farmers are paying carbon tax.

I think the taxation of aviation fuel is a critical issue, which I believe will be addressed by the European Union.

In response to amendment No. 2, the primary purpose of the Bill is to establish the climate action fund on a statutory basis and provide for NORA levy funds to be paid by NORA to the climate action fund to support climate projects.  While I thank the Deputy for recognising and including the imperative of reducing oil consumption in both his amendments, I do not believe his amendments are appropriate to the purposes of this Bill.  The National Oil Reserves Agency was established to manage the State's strategic oil reserves, which the State is required to maintain under European legislation and International Energy Agency rules.  It was established to perform this very particular function in 2010.  It was also assigned the function of administering the biofuels obligation scheme, which it was ideally placed to do, as many of the oil companies which have an obligation to collect the NORA levy also have an obligation under the biofuels obligation scheme.<\/p> <p> NORA is a small agency with very specific expertise in petroleum product storage and in the area of biofuels.  The function of identifying measures to reduce oil demand in the State is one for my Department with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  While there is an urgent need to replace petroleum consumption with more sustainable alternatives, particularly in the transport sector and in the heat sector, it does not make sense to assign to the National Oil Reserves Agency a function in this area.<\/p> <p> Specifically on amendment No. 3, for the reasons I have just explained, there is no requirement for a provision in the Bill to widen the definition of the operating costs and administrative expenses of the agency to include those promoting or developing measures to reduce oil consumption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600025#AA01100","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594905000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I am disappointed.

Let us think of all the people who cannot open their doors and employ the people they were previously employing.  We have no money for home help for people who are trying to stay living in their homes for as long as possible.  People are dying with maggots in nursing homes and there is no investigation into what is going on.  There is no talk at all about carers.  They are left in the wilderness.  They are caring for people in their homes who cannot go to their day care centres or anywhere else.  Men and women in their 70s and 80s are trying to mind their children who have physical and mental disabilities 24-7 in their homes.  At the same time, we are talking about increasing levies and putting more charges on the people of rural Ireland, after what was done to them last night and this morning, so that their doors are closed.  This is absolutely shameful.  This is intended to put more colourful buses in Dublin, where there is enough transport.  As I stated, there is nobody on the buses, other than two or three passengers.  We are being told in advertisements every night that we should not use public transport where it can be avoided.  This is what is going on inside this House.  This event centre is costing hundreds of thousands of euro and this is what we are talking about &ndash; increasing levies on farmers and working people that are out early in the morning with snots in their noses.  This is what we are trying to do to them, drive them down through the ground.  We are an absolute shame.  If this is evidence of the involvement of the Green Party, and if this is the Government we are going to have to persevere with day after day it is a shame and an utter disgrace.

The agency does not have the expertise for energy efficiency.  The expertise for that resides within the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and in my Department.

What I am doing is deleting this particular subsection in the hope that the Minister will see the light and come back, following his discussion in Seanad &Eacute;ireann tomorrow, with an amendment that can be discussed along with the other amendments here next week.<\/p><p>The NORA levy is a levy on the oil industry.  It is paid to the distributors of fossil fuels in this country.  What I want to see is that levy increased from 2 cent a litre to 3 cent a litre with a knock-on reduction in carbon tax.<\/p> <p>From the consumer's point of view, no additional tax would be paid by the people using this fuel.  However, there would be a 50% increase on the tax being paid by the oil industry, meaning that an additional &euro;700 million over the next decade would be used to reduce demand for fossil fuels in this country.<br\/><br\/>I know the gurus in Merrion Street have nobbled away at this particular Bill.  In its initial concept three years ago, it was to be a &euro;1.2 billion fund and that was to be reflected in the calculation of carbon tax.  The carbon tax has been increased but we are not doing anything with this levy.  At a time when the Green Party is in government, it is bizarre that this legislation, which is probably the only Bill we will see that specifically taxes the fossil fuel industry in this country, is not actually going to increase the charge on that industry.  I want to see the levy increased from 2 cent a litre to 3 cent a litre, in line with the original proposal I put to the officials.  If the Minister goes through the file, he will see that.  I want to see a consequential reduction in the carbon tax that reflects this change and ensures the fossil fuel industry in this country starts to foot the bill for bringing about the types of alternatives we are talking about.  I am sure the Minister will respond with some reason that should not happen, but he is the very person who told me earlier that this fund is heavily oversubscribed.  It is a &euro;500 million fund but it can be a &euro;1.2 billion fund.  The Minister will say that is outside the scope of NORA, and indeed it is because he has already rejected amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  He will have an opportunity in the Seanad to table his own amendments to reflect what I have already proposed in amendments Nos. 2 and 3 and to provide for an increase of 1 cent a litre on the fuel industry.<br\/><br\/>Let us increase the taxes on the industry by 50%.  I do not see why they should be getting a free pass.  We are asking the public to foot the bill for fossil fuels through carbon tax but we are letting industry away scot-free.  Rural communities in particular are the ones paying the larger proportion of carbon tax <i>per capita<\/i>because sadly they are the ones who must travel long distances to work.  The Minister has already excluded an opportunity for the farming community to leverage this particular fund through sequestration.  The very least he can do is ensure that industry comes forward with practical and realistic alternatives that provide for a sustainable economy and sustainable solutions that suit an Irish situation.  We tend to forget in the House that 37% of the Irish population live on 96% of the landmass.  We are not like densely populated European countries where everyone lives in cities and large towns.  We have dispersed rural communities.  We need to come forward with innovative ideas that deal with the challenges in transport, heating and agriculture.  I do not think a &euro;500 million fund over ten years is sufficient to do that.  It is not sufficient either for dealing with the challenges within Bord na M&oacute;na.  There is merit in increasing the fund by putting the tax on the fuel industry, by putting our hand into their pockets and by getting them to fund the alternatives.  I hope the Minister will consider my proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600026#BB02100","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594905600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>As Deputy Naughten said, the fund of &euro;500 million over ten years is wholly inadequate.  I am involved in a Tidy Towns committee.  Most of us are involved in committees like that which do wonderful work.  Different schemes are advertised by the county councils about renewables, water pumps and using innovative ideas.  In one case at the moment, we have a tunnel.  We had it up well before the Minister made his speech about window boxes on south-facing windows.  We have an irrigation application in for some grant aid but they are totally oversubscribed.  The Minister is only thinking at a surface level.  A lot of people have great ideas and are interested.  Why has some of the &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion that has been collected in carbon tax from rural dwellers not been used?  It is like saying: \"live, horse, and you will get grass\".<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said to Deputy Naughten earlier that if we do not pass this Bill today in this House, and the same tomorrow in the Seanad, we will lose &euro;10 million.  However, billions are already being collected off the people, and from rural people especially.  Rural people have to travel to work and have no BusConnects.  My colleague from Limerick, Deputy O'Donoghue, brought up the green bus one day.  He has to travel about 80 km when he travels to get that bus.  That is useless and that is how it is for everybody from the country who wants to use public transport.  It is not there.  Many train services and so on have been slashed because of Covid.  Will they ever return?  There is no joined-up thinking.<\/p>  <p>  This fund is wholly inadequate.  I agree with Deputy Naughten that we must penalise the polluters who are in the heavy oil business and make them pay.  They are powerful corporations.  Why is it always falling on the ordinary person who is trying to heat the house or the small farmer who is putting diesel in the tractor?  Deputy Naughten quoted the figures about where people live in Ireland.  We may want to be like other places in Europe but unfortunately we cannot be.  All of the planning guidelines and Ireland 2040 are trying to herd people into the cities and denude rural Ireland but that is not the type of country we are.  People are being browbeaten, literally terrorised and taxed endlessly while seeing no tangible results from it.  It is great to have the dream and the ideals.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister as Green Party leader to call off the dogs regarding the objectors to the felling licences.  Ordinary people have planted trees.  Contractors have invested huge money to harvest those trees now they are mature and there are 80 or 90 objections to the felling licences by one serial objector.  That is a scandal.  These people were good enough to plant their land, which I am not in favour of.  They took the decision to buy into the scheme and invested hugely in it, and now when it is ready for harvest the companies and contractors, who are being penalised with this tax as well, want to get to work but cannot do so.  They are all parked up.  They will go out of business because they cannot pay their loans.  All of this because of objections to felling licences.  We cannot have it every way.  Certainly we want trees but we want to allow those trees to be thinned when they need to be and above all we need them to be harvested when they need to be.<\/p>  <p>  We have to look at this again.  The Minister said in his last response that he wants to help and enable ordinary farmers but that is not the way they feel.  They do not feel they are being enabled or helped.  They feel that they have been trying for decades to make small changes.  They are the custodians of the land and have, in the main, done a damn good job of it.  It is scheme after scheme after scheme and land is being rendered useless.  It cannot be touched because of hen harriers and God knows how many other issues that have been brought in through legislation without proper consultation or engagement with the farmers.<\/p>  <p>  There is no proper consultation or engagement with the communities about this fund.  The &euro;500 million is to be divided up over ten years between the communities and the private companies that will go looking for it.  The big companies will have the expertise and will be able to hire consultants unlike the small, local groups such as Tidy Towns, biodiversity groups and small schools.  Every drop of rainwater in our schools should be harvested, but it is not.  We are using treated water.  If there were enough money in this fund, schools could adapt.  It would be a wonderful concept to educate the children in the three-classroom, four-classroom and five-classroom national schools with 100 pupils that all the water they use, except what they drink, could be collected by harvesting rainwater.  That has been talked about for decades but it has not happened.  This fund simply is not big enough, accessible enough or all-embracing enough to allow people to draw it down.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is not taking any of the amendments so he is not listening.  It is like using a sledgehammer to crack a chestnut.  If the Minister were to bring the people with him they would support him but he keeps throwing diktats at them, having protests, threatening them, demonising farmers and rural people and penalising them with carbon levies.<\/p> <p>They see nothing back.  Where is the almost &euro;4 billion that has been collected already plus the &euro;209 million from the PSO levy that I mentioned already?  Where has that money gone?  It has gone into black holes such as the children's hospital and elsewhere and not on projects that should be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600027#CC00200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594906200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will have to conclude this debate at approximately 3.20 p.m.  Some Deputies went to the trouble of tabling amendments.

This needs to be looked at.  There is also the heating of homes.  One criticism I have of the previous Government in which the Green Party was a member was there was no concentration on the warmer homes scheme.  There should have been strong concentration on the warmer homes scheme to have environmental protection for people's homes.  That was a big issue.  I have been quite critical of the organic farming sector.  The criteria set have made it absolutely sure that most farmers cannot get into organic farming.

This fund is not paid for by the oil companies.  They collect it.  It is paid for by the motorists.  That is one thing to be absolutely clear, honest and accurate about.  If I can refer it to Deputy Mattie McGrath, who asked me whether I was listening, the key question he asked was why could we not have used the money already raised.  To answer Deputy Naughten's earlier concerns, in section 14, the proposed new section 37A(8)(b) states &quot;Any moneys referred to in paragraph (a) which represent the proceeds of the levy collected and recovered before the commencement of the <i>National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Act 2020 <\/i>shall not form part of any payment into the Climate Action Fund under this section.&quot;  This is why we have the difficult timelines with this process, in fairness to Deputy Whitmore and others who have tabled amendments.  This is the reason drafted within the Bill as to why we must make this change.<\/p><p>Deputy Michael Collins is absolutely right about the needs of the village of Goleen.  If Goleen were in Switzerland, a village of that size of approximately 400 to 500 people would have the right to 12 bus services a day.  The first stop would be Toormore and the second would be Lowertown before hitting Schull, Ballydehob, Skibbereen and all points in between there and Cork city.  That is the type of significant change we can make for the better in this whole transition.  Is it going to work?  I commit as Minister with responsibility for transport as well as for energy to do whatever I can to match this type of service and to start thinking in this way to make it work, so that those young people do not have to cycle ten miles down the road and there are vibrant communities at all points in between.  I commit to this.<\/p><p>To answer Deputy Fitzmaurice, he is absolutely right that forestry is in dire straits and my colleague, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, as a farmer herself has a good understanding of what is happening.  More than anything else, as the Deputy has said, it is a planning problem and the biggest concern is a lack of public faith and confidence in what we are doing in development.  This is why the fund is important.  Central to this fund is helping small projects as well as large ones.  It is about the small &euro;5,000 community project.  Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned Tidy Towns and other competitions.  This is not for Tidy Towns; it is for climate projects.

However, as it stands, this Bill will limit them.  It only refers to technological solutions and to emissions reductions and renewable energy.  Essentially, that frames this document, the governance and how the fund will be allocated.  There is a serious risk that they will be the only types of projects that will be covered.<\/p> <p> The Minister agrees that nature-based solutions are an important component of this.  He believes that it should be community-based, that this fund will cover projects within the community and that it should be a bottom-up fund.  That will not happen unless it is specified in the Bill.  While it is his intent that this will happen, that might not be the intent of the next Minister.  We must strengthen this Bill and ensure we incorporate the full remit and scope.  Climate is not just about renewable energy, and our climate response is not just about technological solutions.  We must incorporate other solutions and nature must be a major component of that.<\/p> <p> We are discussing the Bill but the Minister is saying there is no point because we cannot amend it, so I wonder why we are here today at all.

It is a very sad sign that engagement with the other side of the House will not happen during this Government's term.  This amendment outlines the different funds that should be specified in the Bill to ensure there is a possibility to ring-fence money for certain projects.

T&aacute; oifigigh &oacute; mo Roinn anseo freisin.<\/p><p>It is a great honour to present the Revised Estimates 2020 for the Department of Education and Skills to the D&aacute;il.  This is a challenging time for Ireland's society and economy and particularly for the education sector, which has been massively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Students at all levels have had their education dramatically affected.  However, through the efforts of all concerned we are coming through this crisis.  Currently, the first priority for me, my Department and the wider school sector is to reopen our schools as fully, normally and safely as possible at the start of the new school year.  This is an issue to which I will return later.<\/p><p>I will begin by explaining that the Revised Estimates do not reflect the decision announced by the Taoiseach on 27 June last to establish a new Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science.  As such, the Revised Estimates are for Vote 26, which has been the overall Vote for education and skills to date.  Work is under way on the establishment of the new Department under the Minister, Deputy Harris.  This work will involve the separation of significant elements of Vote 26 into a new Vote for that Department.  When the work on allocating those parts of Vote 26 into the separate Vote for the Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science is complete, I will return to the House with further Revised Estimates for the Vote of the Department of Education and Skills.  I look forward to working with the new Minister for further and higher education, research, innovation and science and the Minister of State with responsibility for further education and skills, Deputy Niall Collins, as our two Departments co-operate on their complementary work in the education and skills sector.<\/p><p>The further Revised Estimates Volume will also reflect the inclusion in the responsibilities of my Department of the area of educational welfare and the school completion programme.  These are currently under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and work is also under way to progress the transfer of these functions to my Department.  The allocation of the relevant funds will be included in the further Revised Estimates in the autumn.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 crisis has impacted deeply on the education sector.  Its impact on school and college students has been profound.  While schools and teachers did their best to teach remotely and while home schooling became the norm for many parents and their children, that was no substitute for the classroom.<\/p> <p>Vital opportunities for social interaction, so important to our younger students, were lost for a number of months.<\/p> <p> We all know the impact of the crisis on those due to undertake State examinations this summer.  Trojan efforts have been made by all concerned to put in place alternative arrangements for this year that will ensure students receive calculated grades on a fair an equitable basis and thereby proceed to enter college or to pursue other career paths in the normal manner.  I wish to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt appreciation to all those across the sector who have worked tirelessly to lessen the impact of the pandemic on our students.  They have succeeded in putting in place alternative arrangements for those wishing to progress to and within tertiary education and in planning for the reopening of our schools and colleges in completely unprecedented circumstances.  This includes teachers, school principals, school managers, special needs assistants, SNAs, school secretaries, school caretakers and indeed the entire school community.  In addition, I pay tribute to the work of parents, who have worked so hard to support home schooling since March of this year.  Above all, I commend the students and pupils themselves on their patience and flexibility in adapting to very changed circumstances for the delivery of their education.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned earlier, I am absolutely committed to the goal of reopening our primary and post-primary schools as normal at the end of the summer.  My officials are working closely with all stakeholders to achieve this goal, which is so important for all our students.  There are a number of components to school reopening.  As Deputies will be aware, I recently published interim public health advice, which was provided to my Department by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  This advice is informing the development of clear guidelines for implementation in schools.  We all want to support the education system in order that we can welcome our pupils and staff across our school communities back into a safe environment.  We will continue to work with the public health experts over the summer to update the interim advice as necessary.  In my engagement with stakeholders since my appointment I have been struck by everyone's commitment to providing the best possible experience for the entire school community to return to school as fully, normally and safely as possible.<\/p> <p> A number of challenges arise in reopening schools.  These challenges include physical distancing arrangements, the need for enhanced cleaning and hygiene routines and issues relating to school transport.  Once schools reopen, however, the challenge will be to prevent Covid-19 from getting into schools in order that they can remain open.  This will call for a joint effort on the part of all involved, with those who have symptoms or suspect they have the virus staying out of schools, best hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette practice being maintained in schools, and minimising social contacts and respecting physical distancing practices where practical to do so.  There are well-being aspects and curricular challenges to be identified and addressed.  I assure the House that all these matters are receiving appropriate attention.  I reiterate that it is my utmost priority that student and staff safety and well-being should be to the forefront of all this planning.<\/p> <p> These Estimates were drawn up in late 2019 as part of the 2020 budgetary process.  Much has changed since then, and I will return to the House for approval of additional costs associated with Covid-19 measures needed to reopen schools for what will by then be the Department of education, with the appropriate funds reallocated to the newly established Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science.<\/p> <p> The gross voted allocation for the Department of Education and Skills in 2020 is &euro;10.569 billion.  This breaks down to approximately &euro;9.647 billion in current expenditure and &euro;922 million in capital expenditure.  When the appropriations-in-aid income of &euro;435 million is taken into account, the net voted allocation for the Department is &euro;10.13 billion.  The non-voted National Training Fund, NTF, has an allocation of &euro;623 million, resulting in a total gross allocation for the Department of nearly &euro;11.2 billion.  This represents an increase of nearly &euro;325 million, which is 3% above the Department's allocation for 2019.<\/p> <p> The Department of Education and Skills Vote comprises three programmes: programme A, first, second and early years education; programme B, skills development; and programme C, higher education.  A significant proportion of this Vote is expended on pay and pensions, with some of the almost &euro;7.9 billion included in the Vote for these purposes and a further &euro;236 million in pay being included in the NTF allocation.  Some 113,000 public servants and 50,000 public service pensioners are paid out of these funds.<\/p> <p> Other significant expenditure areas include capital infrastructure, non-pay grants to State agencies, school transport, capitation grants and student supports.  The additional allocation in 2020 will deliver a range of measures in the education and training system.  It will support an additional 1,600 posts in schools, including approximately 1,000 SNA posts and approximately 580 net additional teacher posts, catering for demographics and additional special classes.  These investments will ensure more than 1,300 new special class places.<\/p> <p> Schools will receive a 2.5% increase in capitation from September 2020, with an increase of &euro;4.8 million in school funding in a full year.  A &euro;1 million investment fund for a new pilot that aims to provide free schoolbooks is now available to more than 100 primary schools that are part of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.<\/p> <p> Special education is a particular focus of these Estimates, with more than &euro;1.9 billion, or one fifth, of this budget to be spent on recruiting additional SNAs and teachers to work in our special schools and mainstream schools.  As a result of this investment, there will be 17,000 SNAs in our schools in the coming school year.  This is a record level of resources to be allocated to this area, and I look forward to working with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, as we ensure that these resources are used to ensure that all pupils, whatever their special needs, are able to access the education that allows them to reach their full potential.<\/p> <p> Support for small schools is to be provided for in the Estimates, with improved teacher staffing levels for schools with four or fewer teachers.  A one-point reduction in the staffing schedule will help ensure better teacher retention in smaller schools.  The improved schedule will apply in two, three and four-teacher schools and ensure one fewer pupil is required to retain or recruit a teacher.<\/p> <p> School leadership will continue to be supported, with one additional release day being provided for primary school teaching principals.  The additional time to carry out administrative duties will apply to some 1,760 schools with fewer than seven teachers.  A significant capital budget of &euro;922 million is being provided for in 2020 and will contribute to the development of new, bigger and more energy-efficient school buildings and third level facilities.  Of this provision, almost &euro;748 million will be invested in schools, including investment in ICT, and some &euro;174 million is being invested in the tertiary education and training system.  This investment will deliver more than 30,000 school places and build on the work that has seen &euro;3 billion invested in these building projects since 2016.<\/p> <p> The Department's allocation includes a package of nearly &euro;99 million in measures in the tertiary education system.  This includes almost &euro;70 million in funding arising from an increase in the NTF levy, which is non-voted expenditure.  Supports aimed at providing more third level opportunities are also being provided, with a fund worth &euro;60 million being made available for higher education institutions that seek to create new and diverse courses to expand the number of student places while preparing young people for a fast-changing world of work.  This investment is part of the five-year &euro;300 million human capital initiative established from within the NTF surplus and will add capacity across higher education to meet priority skills needs for enterprise, drive regional jobs growth and development and support key economic sectors in responding to the challenges of Brexit.<\/p> <p> Turning to apprenticeships and skills, these Estimates include a major funding package utilising the resources of the NTF to increase significantly workplace and employer-led training, boost apprenticeship numbers and help address Brexit-related issues.  An additional &euro;27 million is being made available for apprenticeships.  It will support more than 7,000 new apprenticeship registrations in 2020 and a range of new apprenticeship programmes.  By the end of 2020, more than 20,000 apprentices are expected to be in training.  Upskilling is also being supported, with almost &euro;8 million in additional funding for Skillnet Ireland and an additional &euro;6 million for employee skills development initiatives.  This will be particularly important in the context of a response to the changes arising in the labour market from the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p> I refer to the impact Covid-19 has had on the Vote so far this year.  The pandemic has impacted all aspects of the education and skills sector, with schools, colleges and training facilities closing on 13 March.  The junior certificate examinations did not proceed this year, while the leaving certificate examinations were postponed, with students offered the option of receiving calculated grades and the choice to take the exams at a later date when it is safe to do so.  Education did not come to a halt, of course, with most schools and colleges making the transition to online learning, with significant support and input from parents.  Great credit is due to everyone involved: teachers, school management, parents and the students.  I appreciate that this transition may not have fully met the needs of every student, and I know that it was difficult for many, including those in exam years, those leaving primary school and students with additional needs.<\/p> <p>I should explain that the Revised Estimate presented today does not include any provision in relation to Covid-19 at this stage.  Officials at the Department and I have been working with stakeholders on how to open schools safely.  There will be costs associated with reopening.  These costs will arise in relation to hand sanitation and other such cleaning and hygiene requirements but also in terms of teacher and SNA substitution and support for our school leaders.  Officials are actively engaging with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to the financial support that will be necessary.  I am also discussing the matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p> I recognise there is likely to be a need for additional funding to address these costs arising and it is my intention that the exceptional funding requirements of the education and skills sector for this year and other expenditure pressures will need to be addressed as part of the Supplementary Estimates process.  This will allow a clear picture as to the scale of the investment needed in the sector to ensure that it is adequately funded to respond to the unprecedented challenges that currently exist in our schools and colleges.<\/p> <p> Some savings are likely to arise due to lower than anticipated expenditure in certain areas due to Covid-19 while additional and more substantial costs are likely to arise in areas relating to the reopening of schools and colleges.  While costs associated with the State Examinations Commission will be lower due to the State examinations not going ahead as normal, the costs of the calculated grades have also to be factored in.  In addition, there will be costs associated with running the exams at a later time.  The capital allocation in the Vote is likely to be fully expended.  While most construction projects were halted for a number of weeks, they have now resumed.  Any capital expenditure savings arising from Covid-related delays will be required to alleviate budgetary pressures predating Covid-19.<\/p> <p> The departmental restructuring announced by the Taoiseach recently will result in the establishment of the Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science.  This will lead to a split of this Vote in due course, with two of its three programmes being allocated to the new Department, namely, skills development and higher education, together with the NTF and an element of central administration cost.  These areas account for expenditure of some &euro;2.9 billion of the funds provided for in this Estimate, including &euro;2.3 billion in voted moneys.  The tertiary education sector is going through a major transformation and will aim to build on the incredible base of scientific research which has developed in the past two decades and has played a central role in our economy and our ability to respond to the pandemic.<\/p> <p> I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in the months ahead on the establishment of the new Department and beyond.  Functions will also be assigned to the new Department from other Departments with associated voted funds being allocated, while funding for educational welfare and school completion services will be assigned to the Department of Education and Skills from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The programme for Government agreed between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party sets out ambitious goals for all areas of the education sector.  The commitments in the programme will be founded on the principles of excellence, inclusion and sustainability.  The programme calls for additional investment in the sector.  It seeks to address the cost of education, which is a barrier to participation.  It seeks also to be more inclusive.  Plurality and choice will continue to be expanded while the Irish language and culture will be actively encouraged and promoted.  The importance of higher and further education and redress is emphasised.  A key decision of the Taoiseach was to set up a new Department to oversee this sector.  In the months ahead, I will be developing proposals to give effect to the commitments that are relevant to the Department of Education and Skills and such proposals will be costed in the normal manner with due regard to budgetary considerations.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, this Vote represents a record budget for the Department of Education and Skills of more than &euro;11.2 billion.  Of this allocation, some &euro;10.13 billion represents the net Voted amount requiring the approval of the House.  I thank the House for the opportunity to present this Revised Estimate and I look forward to engaging with the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600029#EE00900","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594908000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>This is my first debate with the Minister and, therefore, I take this opportunity to wish her well in her new role and likewise the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p><p>We are here to discuss Revised Estimates for the Department of Education and Skills.  The news for education is that the net allocation sought for education and skills is unchanged from before the pandemic.  I know that the Minister has spoken about this but this reflects a Department that has failed to get to grips with the impact of the pandemic and that is shown in any number of ways.  While it is not the main story on the news every day, I am sure the Minister knows that for countless families across the State the return to school is one of the biggest topics discussed and I include my own in that.  In my view, the core objective here needs to be a full and safe return to school.  That is the core objective of everyone involved in education.  I recognise the huge effort of parents, children, teachers and school staff but, despite the best efforts of all concerned, children have fallen behind, especially children with special educational needs and those from a background of disadvantage.<\/p><p>To reopen safely requires significant investment but there is not a single extra penny in the Revised Estimates to deal with that.  It is farcical.  The Government is trying to give the impression that it is on top of reopening schools.  There is hardly a day that I am not contacted by a parent at their wits' end and completely in the dark.  The same goes for teachers and school staff.  Will their children be going back to school three, four or five days a week?  How many children will be in a pod?  Will children have to wear masks on buses?  Will there be temperature checks?  What are immunocompromised children, parents or teachers supposed to do?  Where do they fit in? <\/p><p>The Minister gave an interview in the<i>Sunday Independent<\/i>last weekend and none of those questions was answered.  That has been a trend in the Department of Education of Skills from before the Minister's time.  There has been confusion and mixed messages from the start.  There was one weekend in May when the then Minister of Education and Skills gave one message early on a Saturday, the Taoiseach gave a different message later that afternoon and a different message again the next day.  Schools have now been closed for four months and are due to reopen in six weeks.  Initial discussions began in late May, two and a half months after schools closed.<\/p><p>We were promised a roadmap on 12 June.  It was put off and now seems to have disappeared from the agenda.  We have a roadmap that governs restaurants, clubs, sports, pubs and a million other things but no roadmap for education.  The closest thing we have is the detailed document on what the Government would not do.  One cannot call that a roadmap.  It has been farcical and unacceptable. <\/p><p>The Minister needs to resolve this and clarify the situation as soon as possible.  We need a roadmap that details how schools will reopen, how children will be kept safe and the contingency plan if the rate of infection increases significantly or there are local outbreaks.  We need investment.  In my view, we need a stimulus into education.  There will clearly be the need for a much stricter hygiene regime.  Many schools that do not have a full-time cleaner will need one.  Many schools that do not have hot water, which is a scandal in itself, will need that to be addressed.  There is a need for additional personal protective equipment, partitions and signage to ensure the return is safe.  It must also include any additional refuse costs.  Where is the &euro;25 million for that?<\/p><p>The fact is that the Department is behind the curve and that is why we are in this situation today with an Estimate that has no additional Covid money.  The Government must ensure that all additional costs are met by the Department and not by parents through an increase in already costly voluntary contributions.  School transport will have to work differently and will need additional funding.  Where is that funding?  There will be a need for additional staff.  We will need more substitutes.  In the event that a teacher becomes unwell, there must be a panel of available substitutes for schools to ensure quick arrangements can be made.  No school should be worse off for staff numbers than they were last year.<\/p><p>In secondary schools, substitutes are not available for some subjects so we need solutions.  It might mean additional funding for existing teachers to teach more classes or perhaps second year Professional Master of Education students or final year students could be part of the solution.  We need additional release days for teaching principals to allow them to focus on making their school safe.  We need more secretarial supports and schools need return-to-school aides, similar to examination aides.<\/p> <p>The Department is way behind the curve on all of these badly needed actions.<\/p> <p> In regard to online learning and the digital divide, the Government spent &euro;60 million on ICT infrastructure for the academic year 2019-20.  While that funding was welcome, it was not enough to provide sufficiently for students during normal times, let alone during the lockdown, when online learning became the norm.  Many children were left behind.  Any approach that advocates for continued online learning without providing the tools required for all pupils to participate will simply exacerbate the educational disadvantage that has come to the surface in recent months.  All of these issues must be addressed but none of the funding is in place to do it.  That is not good enough.<\/p> <p> The other issue I want to raise is one that arises every year but may be of even greater severity this year, namely, that parents have to fork out hundreds of euro, in some instances well over &euro;1,000, to cover their children's return to school.  The reason for this is that our schools are drastically underfunded.  It is crazy that schools have to fundraise and ask for voluntary contributions so that they can pay their energy bills and keep the lights on.  It is crazy how much parents have to spend on schoolbooks in schools where there is no book rental scheme.  I urge the Minister to deal with this issue.  I have been in contact with many parents about this, one of whom gave me that figure of &euro;1,000 as the cost of sending three children to secondary school in the autumn.  That is simply unacceptable and it puts parents under incredible pressure.  My fear is that if the Government does not provide enough funding to schools to ensure they are safe and Covid-ready, the schools will have no other option but to pass the cost on to parents.  Parents cannot bear the cost of the additional hygiene and staffing measures and, in many case, this means, in effect, that the schools will not be able to afford to implement them.<\/p> <p> Finally, I take the opportunity to raise again the question of how out-of-school learners will be dealt with as part of the leaving certificate calculated grades process.  I appreciate that the situation facing the Department was complicated and every solution was going to be difficult, but these particular students have been ignored and neglected and no plan B has been put in place for them.  I urge the Minister to meet with the affected students.  The numbers involved are not large but the injustice they are facing is very grave and needs to be addressed.  I ask the Minister to agree to some kind of arrangement or plan B to ensure they do not lose out on admittance to the third-level courses they would have chosen in normal circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600031#GG00200","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594908600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, has laid out exactly what needs to be done to address the issues facing schools at this time.  I commend parents on their efforts during the lockdown period.  I also commend school staff, including teachers, principals, SNAs, caretakers and cleaners, all of whom put in all the work that was necessary to mitigate what was a really stressful and difficult time for children and parents.  The main problem we have now, six weeks before schools reopen, is that people have suffered through a period of serious pressure.  I cannot say that I have done my fair share in terms homeschooling but I know many parents who put themselves under severe pressure and played an absolute blinder in this regard.  I thank the teachers who engaged in online learning and all the rest of it.  However, from this point on, we need to focus on ensuring schools can reopen after the summer.<\/p>  <p>  We have already talked about the fact that the moneys allocated to this area are insufficient.  We must ensure the money is there for any alterations that need to be made to buildings and to provide schools with the infection control and hygiene paraphernalia and materials that will be required.  Schools cannot afford to make up any additional funding shortfalls in this regard along with all the other shortfalls they are making up.  I have a particular worry in regard to testing and tracing facilities, an issue I will be bringing up directly with the Minister for Health.  Those facilities must be in place across the board, particularly as we open up our schools.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has said she will put everything in place to ensure that schools can not only reopen but stay open.  I hope that will be done.  We heard this week that a nursing home in Dundalk which, over the past few weeks, was able to get testing turned around in four or five hours, has had two cases during the week where the turnaround time was closer to 48 hours.  That issue must be monitored.  We all accept that there are extra difficulties to deal with at the moment, but we need to ensure, as schools and other parts of society reopen, that we have adequate testing and tracing procedures in place.  That is an absolute necessity if we are to shut down problems as they arise and identify suspected cases quickly and move on.  I hope the Minister will chase this matter up and ensure the necessary testing capacity is made available to schools.  I will engage with the Minister for Health to ensure the problem is sorted in respect of nursing homes.  I referred to a specific nursing home, the Dealgan home in Dundalk, which has a very tragic history.  Fortunately, the test results that came back this week were not positive for Covid, but it could have been a lot different.  We need to ensure we have all the capacity necessary to safeguard all our citizens, from the youngest to the oldest.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues and I speak all the time about the need for moneys to be put into particular initiatives such as school completion projects, school breakfast programmes and family interventions and training programmes that are required by both parents and children.  These sorts of necessary interventions may be somewhat costly to fund now, but it will cost a lot more in the long run if we fail to do so.  If that funding is not available, we will not be able to provide children and their families with the supports they require into the future.  These initiatives are vital for children who come from particularly disadvantaged backgrounds and children from families where there is no tradition of going on to apprenticeships or third level.  We must give them all the supports that are necessary to enable them to make the journey that will bring benefits for themselves, their families and the wider society.  That is an absolute necessity.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire spoke about the digital divide, which was particularly obvious for children who are disadvantaged because of poverty or geography.  Even if they had access to the Internet, they did not necessarily have the laptops, iPads or other technology that was required.  There were major failings in this regard and they must be addressed if we are to have a level playing field for everybody.  If we fail to deliver on this, we will all pay for it in the long run.  The divide we are seeing is absolutely unfair.<\/p>  <p>  First and foremost, we must ensure schools can open at the end of August or the beginning of September and that they can stay open.  We need clarity in this regard as soon as possible from the Minister and any agencies with which she is dealing.  The lack of clarity currently cannot continue.  Many parents are at the end of their tether and they would have hoped at this point to have seen exactly what the situation will be in regard to school transport, when their children will be returning to school and how the school day will operate.  They need that certainty in order to get on with the rest of their lives in terms of work and all the other things that are impacted by the current situation.  For our society to operate properly, we need our schools to be open.  I cannot implore the Minister strongly enough to ensure that all the protocols and information people need are provided as quickly as possible.  That has been a failing during this period.  While many things have been done properly, there has also been a lack of clarity.  We must ensure that parents know how and when the schools will reopen.  We must have clarity that children will be able to engage in the necessary education in which many of them have fallen behind.<\/p> <p>I again commend the parents and the school staff.  If not for them, all of this would have been much worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600032#HH00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594909200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Glaoim anois ar Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre.

We are here to discuss Estimates but what we have before us is no reflection of what schools will look like when they open up in September.  I welcome the Minister to her new role and wish her the best in that regard.  However, I cannot understand why we are discussing Estimates that have no bearing on what education will look like in September.  I do not accept that we might have the budget in a few weeks or that it could not have been presented as part of this particular Estimate.  An interesting aspect of having a multitude of spokesperson roles is that one gets to see how other Departments behave.  For example, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht provided its Estimates last week and included some additional Estimates for what the arts sector would look like over the next few months.  I cannot for the life of me understand why that could not have been done for this set of Estimates as well.  There are six weeks left until schools reopen and a number of questions remain to be answered.  In the absence of any real information I will continue to do my job by asking questions and hopefully I will get some answers to them.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister watched some sessions of the Covid committee because we have had some fascinating presentations on education over the last few weeks.  The three teachers' unions, parents' associations from both primary and post-primary level and school principals all came before the committee and all their themes were fairly similar.  They talked about resources, an absence of guidelines and how low morale currently is for both students and teachers.  I will touch on some of those issues.<\/p>  <p>  No resource will be more fundamental in September than staff, taking teachers into account.  Does the Minister expect to have a larger panel of substitute teachers ready to step in all over the country should teacher absenteeism increase?  Teachers may have to withdraw themselves from schools because of a re-emergence of the virus or for a plethora of other reasons that might result in absenteeism.  Will we have more substitute teacher panels ready to go?<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister places huge value on SNAs because I heard her talk about them several times before she became Minister.  SNAs are and always have been hugely important but they will be even more so in the age of Covid-19 due to all the difficulties that will entail for students with special educational needs.  Does the Minister anticipate hiring more SNA staff?  Doing so will create a challenge with Garda vetting, which is very necessary.  While teachers are vetted by the Teaching Council, it is up to schools to vet each individual SNA.  If we reopen schools in the autumn and some SNAs who work very closely with students have to withdraw themselves from the school because of proximity to the virus, will there be other SNAs ready to step in?  Who is going to take on the responsibility of Garda vetting those SNAs?  The schools cannot take that on because they would be overburdened.  It would be better if we had a substitute panel of SNAs who could go to a multitude of different schools.<\/p>  <p>  Cleaning staff are going to be absolutely essential.  Most of the schools I have worked in are allocated only two hours of cleaning staff a day.  That will not be acceptable.  Will schools have the money in their bank accounts in mid-August to hire more cleaning staff?  That is absolutely essential.  Currently, staff do their jobs and the schools apply to the Department for funding but we are going to have to turn that on its head.  Is that going to happen?<\/p>  <p>  One of the school principals who spoke to the Covid committee talked about the need for Covid leaders in each school who understand the roles and responsibilities regarding social distancing and other measures.  Who will be the Covid leaders in schools?  Will it be the deputy principals and if so, can we increase their hours?  Will it be teachers?  That would create its own issues.  Will it be other non-teaching staff?<\/p>  <p>  Infrastructural changes are going to be massively important in schools.  We already have one of the largest class sizes in Europe with a pupil-teacher ratio of 26:1.  That was already a problem for students but in the age of Covid-19 it is actually going to impact their health.  What sort of investment in infrastructural changes does the Minister envision and how much will that cost?  It was hugely disappointing that the Minister's first big announcement was of investment in a school in her own area.  While I am happy for the students in Dromclough national school, there are 405 other schools around the country in similar need of emergency investment.  I ask that we continue that investment in Kerry while bringing it to the rest of the country as well.<\/p>  <p>  The tech void is already a problem but it will be a substantial one if we have to withdraw students from school again, given the issues students had with laptops and access to data.  I ask the Minister to address that and how much she is going to invest in it.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister will answer those questions and then I will come back in with some more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600033#JJ00300","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1594909200,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their engagement and questions, some of which were repeated.  I want to be absolutely unequivocal regarding the reopening of schools.  My first engagement on appointment was meeting with a wide variety of valued stakeholders in education, including parents, teachers, students, managerial bodies, principals and deputy principals.  Following those consultations, I was very pleased that there is an absolute collective agenda to reopen the schools fully in the next number of weeks, at the end of August or early September.  That is a common and shared objective.  There is no ambiguity, question mark or difficulty around that.  It is a common agenda to reopen the schools fully and safely at the appropriate time, which is the end of August or start of September, depending on the norm.<\/p>  <p>  Questions have been raised about the return to school budget not being evident in these Estimates.  This Revised Estimate relates to what was brought before the House late last year.  There is most certainly going to be a further requirement relating to the Covid-19 reopening of schools.  I am very conscious of that.  Previous speakers highlighted some of the issues that would be addressed in a budget of that nature, such as personal protective equipment, PPE, sanitisation, cleaning regimes, and so on.  My Department and officials are currently working through that and we are in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All the necessary funding to make the opening of schools possible will be put in place and I assure Deputies that I will be returning to them with a fully itemised budget so they will know exactly where the money was spent and how.  For me to come in at this stage, when schools have not yet reopened, would be short-sighted and would not allow me to present Deputies with a full picture, as is my obligation to them.  I assure Deputies that the budget is currently being worked through, and engagement and discussion with the stakeholders who have particular issues and challenges to raise with me and my Department is ongoing.

I recognise that there will be a requirement for substitution to be put in place and that the Department will be footing a bill of that nature.<\/p> <p>There was also an issue regarding vulnerable students and how we will cater for them.  I am very conscious of children with particular needs as I come from that environment and they will also be catered for in this reopening of schools.  Well-being will be a major issue for many children in future but also for the entire school community, and resources in respect of resilience and mental well-being will also be put in place.<\/p> <p> There is no confusion.  There is a clear agenda to reopen schools fully come late August and early September and the necessary resources will absolutely be put in place to make that happen.  Issues were also raised regarding the voluntary contribution.  I acknowledge that parents and guardians are under particular stresses regarding voluntary contributions, perhaps now more so than ever.  Regarding that issue, in the budget there is a 2.5% increase in capitation fees, and that is on top of the 5% increase from last year.  I acknowledge that does not bring us to the pre-2011 level, but it is a recognition of and commitment to the need to put in place resources that will ensure less of a financial burden is being placed on parents.

We will get the niceties out of the way and then we will get political.<\/p>  <p>  I think we all agree that by comparison with March, the Irish classroom will look very different in September.  The last five months have shown us the major fault lines in our public services in health, education etc..  I refer to the statistic that Ireland has one of the highest pupil-teacher ratios in the OECD.  In some cases, one in five children is in a class of 30 or more pupils.  If that is the case, it will be a gigantic challenges if schools are to look in any way like they were in March.  This issue comes down to resources and I have three questions on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of education, the Government should examine what was done with the Be On Call for Ireland initiative in the health sector.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is here.  I refer to a call for people in education systems abroad to come back to Ireland and lend us their expertise, because this will be a call to arms in September to get our classrooms ready and have the education system that we had in March.<\/p>  <p>  I have three questions that I hope the Minister will be able to address.  Will the Department look into recruiting final year students in teacher training courses to work in primary and secondary schools in September?  I know this was done with student nurses.  Is the Department looking for alternative spaces, particularly around schools, in areas where there are going to be major problems concerning space in classrooms?  Is the Department looking for extra space on campuses or near campuses?  Will the Department call for a freeze on proposed reductions in teacher numbers in certain schools come September?  I ask that because some schools will lose teachers because they might have a slightly different number of pupils than they did last September.  It does not make sense for schools to lose teachers, so will the Department put a freeze on that happening?

Regarding the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio, there is a clear acknowledgement in the programme for Government on that issue.  In respect of the future, however, it should be acknowledged that there has been improvement in schools with one to four teachers.  There has been a points decrease that has improved the situation in those schools.<\/p>  <p>  In the broader picture that the Deputy mentioned concerning allocation, providing teachers and ensuring they get into schools, we are very active in that regard.  There has been a very successful teacher supply panel.  We are also looking at a mechanism of that nature in future.  In addition, we are in discussions with key stakeholders regarding how we will cater for requirements that will be necessary for substitution and provision in schools.  It will be catered for, because it is an issue within schools.  If teachers are absent, or whatever the case may be, it will be necessary for them to be replaced.  We are actively working on that issue through the teacher supply panel.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the issue of the requirement for extra space in schools.  Many schools have on-campus facilities, such as halls, that can be utilised for extra space.  In other instances, such spaces will not be available.  We are looking at all avenues in areas in proximity to schools in order that these facilities can be utilised if the need arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600034#KK00800","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1594909800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I will follow on from that point, because Deputy Kenny's question prompted a thought.  The Department of Education and Skills has buildings which are sitting empty.  One such building is the old education and training board building on Eblana Avenue in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It has been sitting empty for the last two or three years, which was an absolute disgrace in and of itself pre-Covid.  Given that we now have a desperate need for space, workers should be sent in to refurbish that building so it can be made available for education at second level or third level as a matter of urgency.  We should be looking at empty buildings in every locality that could, potentially, be available to give us the extra space we will need for primary, secondary and third level education.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning the July stimulus next week, there is much understandable emphasis on small and medium enterprise and the need to protect and sustain jobs.  The stimulus, however, should not just be seen as a private sector thing.  In fact, a major area where there needs to be a stimulus is to strengthen and resource our public services, obviously in health but education is another key area and we could say the same about public transport.  Those areas are necessary to deal with the current pandemic but they are also an economic and employment stimulus.  The Government needs to be aware of that.<\/p>  <p>  My specific question to the Minister, Deputy Harris, concerns the many third-level students who are facing blended learning.  They are being told that they will only be doing one day of lectures on campus and then four days online.  If that is the case, those students are asking why they should be paying &euro;3,000 in fees for an undergraduate course or &euro;6,000 in fees for a postgraduate course.  It is simply not justified.  I do not believe those registration fees, which are some of the highest in Europe, are justified at all, even pre-Covid.  How will the Minister respond to the call from students who are stating that those fees should be dramatically reduced or abolished, given the diminished lecture hours they will be doing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600034#KK00900","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1594909800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his questions.

I assure the Deputy that there will be a focus in the July stimulus on helping to get people back to learning and into apprenticeships and on the many other ways in which we can help people to get their lives back on track through utilising our public services and including our further education, training and higher education sector.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the issue of student costs, this is an area that needs significant overhaul and reform.  The programme for Government makes very clear commitments to not increasing the costs.  Deputy Gannon asked me to confirm that earlier today and I am happy to do so.  I want to look at how we can better support students, but my first absolute priority between now and September is getting colleges back up and running and getting students back into learning.<\/p> <p>We will then have the budgetary process whereby we can look at how we can further address the costs facing students and the student supports we have in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600034#KK01000","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594910400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Next is the Regional Group, which has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600035#LL00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1594910400,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The Regional Group is here; we are up in the cheap seats at the back.

This is my first opportunity to address the Minister in this forum.  I wish to extend every best wish to her and her family regarding her recent appointment.  I look forward to working with her and the Government in the coming years.  It is in the interests of everyone here that she has a successful tenure as Minister for Education and Skills because the stakes are so high in the country at this time.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for bringing these Revised Estimates before the House.  Despite their imperfections, which have been already outlined in the House today and by the parliamentary budgetary office, I remain happy to support their passage through the House in light of the extraordinary times in which we are living.<\/p>  <p>  I have three quick observations to make.  The first is that I welcome the formation of the new Department with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science.  Its creation is a positive development and long overdue.  As these Estimates show, we are spending a little shy of &euro;3 billion every year in this area.  It is only right and proper that these public funds are protected and managed appropriately.  Significant funds are available at EU level for research, innovation and science.  It is vital that we access these funding streams as effectively as possible in a more co-ordinated way.  Our knowledge-based economy needs to be sustained with ongoing creativity and cutting-edge technology to compete internationally.  I am pleased to see the Minister without portfolio, Deputy Harris, in the Chamber today.  I wish him every success in establishing and leading this new Department.<\/p>  <p>  I am somewhat concerned that there is as of yet no published plan for the reopening of schools in over five weeks' time.  I take the points made by the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I accept and acknowledge them.  However, the Estimates illustrate that we still have some distance to travel.  The Department of Education and Skills is still engaged in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on what financial supports will be required.  I would have thought that negotiations would have been well concluded at this stage as the extent of the additional funding required should surely be known at this time.  We should know what we need to support and increase the number of substitute teachers and SNAs as well as the hand sanitiser, PPE and professional deep cleaning services that will be required.  Clarity in this regard would be certainly helpful.  I look forward to the full plan being published as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the modest increases in current expenditure for 2020, nevertheless I am concerned at the reduction in capital expenditure for third level institutions in programme C and, most important, the reduction in capital spending for the primary and post-primary sectors in programme A.  The schools building programme is particularly important at post-primary level.  Many of our school buildings are unable to cope as it is even without the increasing demand projected for student admissions in the coming five years.  In my constituency, Kildare South, Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Portarlington is creaking at the seams.  St. Paul's Secondary School in Monasterevin is in dire need of rebuilding and a new post-primary school is urgently required in the Curragh, Newbridge and Athgarvan areas to deal with chronic capacity issues.  Aside from the self-evident educational benefits, labour-intensive employment opportunities like school construction are crucial to return the economy to growth.  I look forward to the publication by the Government of the three-year capital plan in October which will, I hope, address this problem.  Again, I thank the Ministers for coming to the Chamber today.  I wish them both the best of luck in the challenging days ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600035#LL00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1594910400,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I appreciate the comments and thank Deputy Berry for his good wishes.  The Deputy asked about clarity around the reopening of the schools.  I have no wish to repeat myself again.  I want to make it clear that there is no ambiguity on this issue.  Importantly, from my point of view, there should be full and frank engagement with all stakeholders.  There are many constituents in education and they must be consulted and be part of the process.  That is where we are at.  There is a clear objective.  The schools will reopen at the end of August or early September as per normal.  The finer details and the challenges that may have to be ironed out are currently being ironed out.  There is no ambiguity whatsoever in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines for the reopening of schools have been issued to primary schools already.  They are in the public domain.

I am also pleased to see the Minister without portfolio, Deputy Harris, in a new role and out of where he was.  I know he left the children's hospital in a black hole so I hope we will have a better relationship in this Department.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the Minister has repeated herself and said there will be funding.  However, I cannot believe we are bringing the Estimates today - I am not blaming the Minister - and that there is no funding announced and no idea of the Covid-19 costs.  Children and families from playschool, national school, secondary school, third level, fourth level and further education have been scattered to the winds.  It has been a trying time for teachers, families and the students.  This is concerning.  We need to have surety.  I heard the Minister say there will be funding for the schools.  I have served on school boards of management.  They are run on a shoestring.  They need to know that money is available if they spend it on getting hot water into the toilets, which is a basic necessity.  If they spend money on the yard or in the classroom and putting up Perspex it will be costly.  They need to know they have it.  They fundraise using draws and everything else.  I know the Minister is keenly aware of that.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister and her Department for engaging with Cahir Boys National School and Our Lady of Mercy Primary School.  The project has been going on for more than 30 years.  It went to tender last November.  I thank the Minister for coming back to me on it.  I thank the Sisters of Mercy and Bishop Phonsie Cullinan, the patron, for giving the site.  I compliment all involved, including those on board of management, past and present, the parents council and everyone.

We have had Zoom meetings and round-table meetings during the past few weeks.  They do not know if they are going to get an extra cleaning grant to pay for extra hours required so that cleaning can happen.  The boards of management and parents associations cannot be expected to fundraise as they have been doing for years.  This time it cannot be done.  They do not know if the capitation grant will be raised this year, although it needs to happen.  Is there a transport plan or clarification on extra school buses being approved or provided?  What about the seating plans on the buses?  Will the children have to wear face masks?  Overall, is there a plan in place?  Is it still being figured out?  Many schools are concerned that emergency grants and additional accommodation grants will not materialise.  Will they be available?

The green light for funding was given, and the schools have asked me to convey their thanks to the Department for that.<\/p> <p> I visited Rath national school in Baltimore, west Cork, last week which needs urgent funds.

I want to focus on why the Revised Estimates do not include provision for school staff numbers despite the fact that we are here to make provision for an unchanged net allocation of over &euro;10.1 billion.  The gross allocation sought is &euro;10.6 billion.  As the Secretary General of the Department has acknowledged, there will be a need to employ additional staff and it has recently been accepted that we will have to free up leadership time that will have to be covered.  We will need to examine different ways of providing substitution for teachers and SNAs because we want to minimise the number of schools substitute teachers will be in.  We may be able to create more full-time posts.<\/p>  <p>  Schools in my constituency are losing valuable and much needed teachers because of the current pupil-teacher ratios.  I am aware that schools in my constituency are on split sites and I have written to the Minister about one such national school in Ferbane which is facing the removal of a teacher because it is five children short of the target needed to retain the teacher.  This is unfair and wholly unacceptable, given that we are in the middle of a pandemic.  Is there any room for a full moratorium on teacher losses while the Covid-19 emergency remains with us?  I raised this issue with the Minister's predecessor, but I would appreciate if some attention could be given to it because there will be chaos in our schools in September.<\/p>  <p>  Schools' leadership is faced with a great deal of responsibility.  Those involved have to ensure that children will be adequately spaced and that there will be supervision in halls and other areas of schools.

I am very glad that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  What we are asked to debate here today is very unusual because we are talking about Revised Estimates, which involve a lot of money, while at the same time there is a high level of uncertainty and chaos in the education system.  Principals of national and secondary schools, people in third level education, bus operators who take people to school and those seeking accommodation for the new academic year all face awful uncertainty.  I ask the Ministers to help these people. <\/p>  <p>  I want to relay the details of a phone call I had in the past two hours.  A mother told me she is being asked to pay &euro;3,859 for student accommodation between now and Christmas, and to pay the same amount at Christmas in order to secure accommodation for her young student going into third level education.  They do not know how many days per week the student will be attending college, how many hours of lectures will take place in college, how many nights they will need accommodation for or what they will require for the new academic year.  This uncertainty is creating chaos.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot have a situation whereby schools have to fundraise to provide for basic essentials, such as repairing windows or a roof.

I thank the Parliamentary Budget Office for its work and for producing a very good paper.  It has raised many good and not so good issues.  It points out that, in particular, the pattern of little or no information being provided on performance for the spending of vast sums of money is far from best practice and, even in challenging circumstances, that needs to be addressed.  That does not apply only to this Department, it applies to all of them.<\/p><p>It is unfortunate that we are discussing the Revised Estimates with no provision for Covid-19.  The Ministers stated they will come back on this, and I welcome that they have indicated that there will be no shortage of money and that funding will be provided.  I am still not entirely clear on when the Ministers will come back to us.  I presume schools will have opened and the Minister will come before us at that point.<\/p><p>The issue of school transport has arisen in the context of a special school in Galway.  I am sure it is not confined to Galway or the July provision.  This problem will arise in September.  What analysis or research has been carried out by the Department on this matter?  Is it in a position to provide such an analysis?  Does it have sufficient staff to carry out this type of analysis?  Will the Department examine the July provision to determine how many children were excluded and how the system can be improved for next year?  Does it have that type of resources?  If not, why not and what is it going to do about it?<\/p><p>We are constantly told that we need to make decisions based on evidence.  I know for a fact that children in Galway are being excluded from the July provision because of the failure to provide school transport.  Related to that is, of course, climate change.  We have no choice but to embrace school transport.  What provisions are being made by the Department for comprehensive school transport that will deal with our climate change obligations?<\/p><p>Additional space has been mentioned, and it is something I would like the Minister to reflect on.  Schools have been forced to use space for private car parking in order to provide additional income.  This is very bad because it uses public space for car parking, something which is obviously essential in a place like Galway.  We need a different way of looking at this in light of our climate change obligations and the fact that, I presume, there will be a reduction in the use of private cars in the future.  This came into acute focus for me recently when there was a difficulty with a market that had to be spaced out.  Space had to be bought from a school that provided car parking in its yard for years.  These decisions have follow on consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600036#MM00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1594911000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I cannot deal with the transport issue, but I can tell the Deputy about the July provision.

As I have said in previous debates, value for money needs to be part of the discussion. For now, however, I will leave that aside.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the Minister, Deputy Foley, on the principle of reopening our schools.  Many parents and teachers have contacted me and for all of them, the continuing education of children is an absolute priority.  The Minister spoke of some of the components that will allow this to happen.  She spoke of employing more teachers and specifically mentioned small schools.  I agree but we must also ensure larger schools get support.  I wrote to the Minister about a relatively large school that had the numbers to employ an extra teacher in 2021 but it is not able to employ this teacher this year.  It is going to end up with 33 junior infants in a class and an empty classroom.  In such circumstances, schools should be able to employ an extra teacher.  <\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned to the previous Minister, many community and voluntary groups have community centres and other suitable premises available to them.  Language schools, for example, have space that could be used by primary or post-primary schools.  I ask the Minister to consider that.<\/p>  <p>  To address the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, Deputy Harris, the development of the Connacht-Ulster technological university, TU, must be prioritised.  Everybody talks about balanced regional development.  An essential component of that is third level facilities where creativity and excellence can flourish.  The three colleges that would make up the Connacht-Ulster technological university are the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT.  Two of the three can meet the criteria but the issue is whether all three will meet them by the end of the year.  The guidelines allow two of the three colleges to proceed ahead and the third to join afterwards.  While I hope all three can meet the criteria, if that is not the case, it is absolutely essential that the two which can meet them proceed.  I will give the Minister one statistic that shocked me when I heard it.  The south and east, as the Minister will be aware, is mentioned twice in the programme for Government.  When all of the technological universities are in place, we will have five third level colleges in the southern part of the country, eight in Dublin and two in Connacht-Ulster.  That is only if the Connacht-Ulster technological university goes ahead.  I ask for an absolute commitment from the Minister, while the window of opportunity is available, to work with the three colleges in question and if two of them can go ahead, to ensure the new technological university is in place by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600037#NN00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1594911600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>The Ministers will have to correspond with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600037#NN00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1594911600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I sincerely congratulate the new Ministers, Deputies Foley, Harris, Niall Collins and Madigan, on their appointment.

I was a schoolteacher until 11 or 12 weeks ago so this issue matters a great deal to me.  My eldest son, Sam, will start junior infants in September.  Beyond the mechanics of getting back to school, my wife and I do not want to disappoint him by telling him on 31 August that he might be home for another few weeks during which we would have to try to entertain him.  As the Minister, Deputy Madigan, said, this is fun but it has its challenges.  I am hopeful the two education Departments can collectively offer clarification on that issue in the next week or two in order that parents and schools will be able to plan effectively.<\/p><p>The main issue I wish to raise is that of third level education, specifically third level accommodation.  With the new academic year nearly upon us, most third level students are unaware if the majority of their tuition from September onwards will take place via distance learning, Zoom lectures and, webinars or will whether they will be in lecture halls on a rostered basis.  How they will learn is not as crucial a concern as where they will live.  Parents are unsure whether they should commit to expensive tenancy agreements for on-campus or off-campus accommodation or if a more <i>ad hoc<\/i>accommodation, such as short-term Airbnb lettings, would be more suitable if students will be on and off campus a lot.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to expressly offer some clarity on the matter in order that parents and students can make informed decisions in this regard.<\/p><p>St. Aidan's national school in Shannon, County Clare, is one of those schools with supersized classrooms.  In one particular classroom there will be 37 pupils sitting behind desks in September.  Social distancing, as we know it, will not be possible in that environment.  The school has applied for an additional teacher but has been unsuccessful in that regard.  It has corresponded with the Department of Education and Skills and I am hopeful the Minister, Deputy Foley, will revisit the case of that particular school.<\/p><p>I raise the issue of school bus transport for a number of second level students from the small village of Crusheen in County Clare.  In total, 13 children from the village attend St. Joseph's secondary school in Tulla.  They have been told by Bus &Eacute;ireann that buses cannot be routed for their daily collection and drop-off because they are marginally closer to the CBS school in Ennis.  It was also suggested that they consider attending Gort community school in south County Galway.  The rules relating to school bus transport are convoluted, as everyone knows.  There is an ideal opportunity to review them as we come to the second half of the summer and people prepare to book tickets for school transport.  Parents have submitted a petition to the Department and I ask that it be looked at by the relevant Minister.<\/p><p>The Department approved new classrooms for Clonmoney national school in County Clare last year.  However, everything is at a standstill.  The stage 2a report the school submitted shows that the cost will exceed the funding sanctioned by the Department by approximately 10%.  The school needs departmental approval to move to the planning and tender stage.  On top of this immediate problem, the school's board of management has an acute worry that one mainstream classroom and one special education teacher room will be grossly inadequate to meet the school's short-term and medium-term needs.  Will the Minister, Deputy Foley, ask senior officials from her Department's building unit to directly engage with the school's principal, Mr.David McCormack?<\/p><p>St. Enda's national school in Lisdoonvarna currently has 130 pupils enrolled, of which 26, or 20% of the school population, live in the local direct provision centre.  One fifth of the school population do not speak English as their first language.  While they are learning and making huge inroads, as one can imagine, this places a strain on teaching resources and it is difficult for the school to meet the needs of those who are fluent in the English language and those who are acquiring it as a brand new language.  The school desperately needs to have a reduced pupil-teacher ratio in order that the needs of all pupils can be met.  <\/p><p>I ask that the Department look at special cases like St. Enda's national school in Lisdoonvarna.  Overnight, this small village had a direct provision centre with none of the ancillary services that go with that.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Foley, is familiar with this issue from her own constituency.  A possible solution would be to automatically grant DEIS band 1 status to such schools, thereby giving them access to a whole range of supports.  Perhaps there is a tailor-made solution for schools with this kind of acute need.<\/p><p>I know the issue of Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, is close to the heart of the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.  As a previous speaker stated, there are movements all around the country to have regional technological universities.  LIT has fantastic links not only in its native city of Limerick but also through a campus in Tipperary and an impressive campus in Ennis in my home county of Clare.<\/p> <p>There is a need to look at ways of advancing that.  It would go down well in the mid-west.<\/p> <p> I have covered all the issues.  I thank the Ministers and wish them well.  It is great to see a teacher leading up the Department of Education and Skills.  Deputy Foley will have a direct hands-on approach to this.  She knows from her front-line experience of only a few weeks ago.  Like myself, she was in the books and red-pen territory.  I have every belief that all four Ministers and Ministers of State will adjust well to their new roles.  I hope they can deliver on all the issues I have highlighted today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600037#NN00500","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594912200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I too wish the Ministers and Ministers of State well.  As they know, education is so important in these times.  Given the concerns that we have, it is so important to have such good people in education.  I wish them well.  I want a lot of work done for Carlow, just so as we start on the record first.<\/p>  <p>  There is much concern about the return to school in September.  There are parents out there afraid to buy schoolbooks and uniforms because they are not convinced their children can return to school.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, the summer works scheme provides funding to individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works which ideally can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school.  This was an ideal time to have carried out these works with schools off and construction resumed before anyone was on-site.  A number of schools in County Carlow have not heard back about the grants they have applied for.  Instead, there was a very small number of grants given under the emergency school grant scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As we have heard, it is the Minister's firm intention that children are to return to school.  In cases of schools which were overcrowded already, school authorities are looking around to see where they can make space to bring children back and comply with social distancing.  Why were these schools not given funding to increase their accommodation?  I was so upset over the summer.  I had been working with people in a school who are getting a new school building.  They had been given a commitment that they would get a prefab for a year or so until the school was ready to start the build.  They got word a few weeks back that they could not get that prefab because there was no money for it.  I do not know whether there are prefabs available.  Maybe the Minister can come back to me on that.  However, I now have a school principal in Carlow who does not know where she will put all her young students because she has been told by the Department that there is no prefab there for her.  If there is no funding for these projects and if there is not enough money to give sufficient funding to repair a roof, for example, how can schools expect that there will be funding to return to school?<\/p>  <p>  We need clarification on this.  I welcome what the Minister stated earlier on.  Are parents to be asked to supply funding for PPE, cleaning and extra staffing?  Parents have suffered enough, having had to educate their children for the best part of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Where will the children who could not fit already in these small rural schools go in September?  Is the Minister looking at halls and football clubhouses?  We need the roadmap.  We need clarification.  I listened to the Minister's brief.  Can we have a copy of the Minister's statement?  That would be important.  We did not get a copy of it today.  Even for us, for clarification, it would be important to get a copy of what the Minister said today.<\/p>  <p>  Other Deputies have spoken about school transport.  This scheme was not fit for purpose previously.  With restrictions on public transport now, what are we doing for schoolchildren?  Is there a roadmap for that?  It is only six or seven weeks until school returns.  Can we get information because that is so important?<\/p>  <p>  The other area I have been working on for the past few years is DEIS schools.  The Minister said that a fund to provide free schoolbooks is now available to more than 100 DEIS schools and I welcome that.  However, I have been working for years for two schools in Tullow that have requested DEIS status.  The system of DEIS and how one applies needs to be looked at.  These are schools that should be in DEIS.  They fit all the criteria, but we are told they are not getting DEIS status.  I will give the Minister the names of the schools.  I will talk to her about it because I have other schools that I firmly believe should get DEIS status.<\/p>  <p>  The other area I want to talk about and that the Minister spoke about is apprenticeships.  I would welcome if we could get the numbers on that.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the investment in SNAs the Minister spoke about.  This is the highest number ever - 17,000.  We will do so much.  I believe we need to do so because this is a different time for schools and for teaching.  My daughter is a teacher.  She sees the challenges she is facing in the school she is in.<\/p>  <p>  What I will say to the Minister, Deputy Harris, is that I, as a Carlow woman, would be always promoting the technological university for the south east.  The south-east Deputies have had a good few meetings.  We have met the president of Institute of Technology Carlow, Dr. Patricia Mulcahy, and the president of Waterford Institute of Technology, Professor Willie Donnelly.  We are fully supporting it.  I believe the Minister met the presidents last week.  Technological university status is so important for the south east, and particularly for Carlow, my home town.  I know we can deliver so much there.  It is a great school, like all the others.  They are all doing their best.  What I want to know from the Minister is whether there is funding.  Can he guarantee that?  What is the timeframe?  In the Seanad, in 2018, we passed the legislation providing for technological university status.  In particular, I need to ask the Minister today whether he can confirm the timeframe for the south-east technological university.<\/p>  <p>  That is the bulk of my questions.  The Ministers, Deputies Foley and Harris, might come back with some answers.  I wish them well.  I believe they have many challenges going forward.  I would ask that we get clarification and information to the parents because there are concerns out there.  We all heard on the news the other night that we could have another surge.  Hopefully, we will not.  Parents are concerned for their children.  It is important that we give as much information as possible to the schools but also to the parents who are trying to know what is best to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600038#OO00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1594912200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>To Deputy Crowe, I say well done.  He raised quite a number of schools in his locality and I appreciate that.  I recognise that the demands in schools can be as individual as they can be universal.  The Deputy specifically named individual schools and I assure him my officials will engage.  I will revert to the Deputy in due course with an update on those schools.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, I appreciate the point that Deputy Murnane O'Connor raised in terms of emergency works.  They are by their name emergency works.  Occasionally, schools might not qualify because they are not deemed to be an emergency.  Be that as it may, if the Deputy wants to bring the specific cases she raised to my attention, my officials will engage with her.  On a point of information, and it has been raised by previous speakers, we have applied through the July stimulus for a minor works programme which, I believe, has the potential to be hugely significant going forward for schools.  These will be works that will enable schools to carry out measures that will improve school buildings as we journey through Covid, but in the main will improve them in general as well.  We are looking for that enhanced minor works grant.  Current grant costs are approximately &euro;30 million and we anticipate that we should be able to raise that to &euro;50 million.  That would be positive news for schools.  We hope that will come next week.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that parents will not be footing the bill for the reopening of schools.  There is absolute clarification on that.<\/p>  <p>  There are 890 DEIS schools serving 180,000 pupils.  I appreciate that this is being reviewed since 2017.  On the applications for new schools to come on board, I will revert to Deputy Murnane O'Connor on the specific ones she has mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  Specific guidelines have been issued in relation to school transport.  We are currently working through those guidelines with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We are confident that the school bus service will be available as normal for students to take up.

It is advisable for those over 13, but the intricacies of it are currently being worked through.

There is a lot of work to be done and I wish them the best.<\/p>  <p>  We have talked a lot today about Covid and the return to schools.  I will raise a longer-term issue which I believe must be raised now to ensure it is planned for when it arises 12 months from now.  I refer to the issue of relationships and sexuality education.  One measure that is very important to me is an ongoing education programme that aims to protect young people as they go into adulthood by educating them on domestic abuse, gender and sexual violence, and coercive control.  Tremendous work has been done by the Department, the various stakeholders and the Oireachtas committee led by the now Senator Fiona O'Loughlin of Fianna F&aacute;il, on a relationships and sexuality education programme that teaches about boundary management, consent, mental health supports, emotional well-being and respect for the self from the earliest stage and throughout the school programme.<\/p>  <p>  In order for this to be on the curriculum 14 months from now in September 2021, an awful lot of work needs to be done with regard to training teachers, who have expressed interest in the programme and a desire for further and better training, and with regard to the regulation of any external providers.  On the occasion of this Estimate, I want to ask the Minister whether the funding is available.  Has the planning been done to account for the necessary training in advance of the stakeholder consultation, which is due to finish shortly, and the anticipated and hoped for roll-out of the programme in September 2021?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600039#PP00300","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1594912800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>First, I congratulate all four new Ministers, particularly Deputy Foley, who is taking on a very considerable Department, despite the creation of the new Department for higher education and research under the Minister, Deputy Harris.  While this new Department will be equally as important as the Minister's last Department, I imagine it will be somewhat less frenetic.  I wish him well in that.<\/p>  <p>  We do not need to spend too much time talking about the profound impact of the events of recent months on the children of Ireland.  It is really important to note the disruption to the education system, which has really challenged children in every county on the island.  We have all learned, however, that there is strength in unity with regard to our response and what we can achieve when we work together.  That is why it is important to note the remarks of a number of speakers with regard to a collaborative and co-operative approach with the Department of Education and Skills, and the new Department responsible for higher education, in respect of how we respond to the pandemic and how we improve the education of our children and young adults.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, we are all aware that as a matter of urgency, the Department must provide parents and third level institution students with clarity as to how schools will be safely reopened.  We are all aware the current situation as regards the virus is quite volatile.  Indeed, we have already seen changes made to our roadmap.  In a relatively short period, however, that could change back.  We should not lose heart but, at the same time and has been said by a number of Members, it is incredibly important that we provide clarity to parents up and down the country in order that they can make the choices and decisions they need to make early in the month of August as regards the upcoming school year.  The education system is, of course, of paramount importance to any functioning and progressive state.  Education will be even more important than it was a decade ago in responding to the economic challenges that will arise as a result of Covid-19.  We must ensure that no opportunities are lost in educating our children.  <\/p>  <p>  As we know, a child's development in the first 13 years of life will form lifelong habits and characteristics which will affect their later life profoundly.  We owe the children of Ireland a coherent and practicable plan to deliver the quality education they deserve.  As such, we really do need to seek to address all of the concerns of parents and professionals with regard to the guidelines on staggering of school drop-off times, locations, and analysis of existing school infrastructure with particular regard to bathroom and hand-washing facilities.  Parents should be provided with information even on something as simple as alterations of sleeve lengths for younger students who will be using sanitiser or washing their hands more frequently so that they and the students themselves can get used to it.<\/p>  <p>  As we learn more about the virus, it becomes clearer that interactions with others and sufficient air ventilation can prove the difference between preventing and facilitating its spread.  Supporting schools in obtaining the necessary equipment to enhance air ventilation is important as we reopen schools.<\/p>  <p>  Providing a clear and effective path in a timely manner will achieve the fundamental goal of giving confidence to parents and teachers.  When a parent leaves a child at school, he or she will know that the child will be taken care of, as always, but will also be protected in a safe and healthy environment with regard to the eradication of Covid-19 from our society.<\/p>  <p>  A number of issues have already been raised by Members with regard to the point the Minister has repeatedly made, that is, that parents will not have to pay for the preparation of schools to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  I will also say on behalf of the teachers that it is important that they do not have to foot the bill for their own personal protective equipment in circumstances where it is appropriate or recommended by NPHET that they use it.  That information needs to be put into the public domain in order that people will know precisely what is going to occur this coming September.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has transformed Irish society over recent months.  Few would have thought possible the profound changes we have witnessed over such a short period.  This crisis, however, has shown the strength of Irish people and the ability of our people and communities to pull together and to overcome significant challenges, hardships and heartbreak.  This provides us with an opportunity to reimagine our approach to future crises and challenges, as we acted with clarity and confidence as a people.  This extends to every Department and every policy and education is no exception.  <\/p>  <p>  It is my hope that we will embark on a serious attempt to improve a number of areas within the Irish education system in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, including reinvigorating our approach to special education, supporting gifted children and talented youth, expanding accessibility of the summer provision programme and improving aspects of higher education in Ireland.  I was particularly heartened the day before yesterday to see the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, whom I congratulate on her new role, meeting Colm O'Reilly of the Centre for Talented Youth.  We, as Parliament, and Ministers, as members of the Government, must evaluate on a more regular basis how we can support gifted children.  It is often the case that gifted children have other educational needs and require educational supports.  That is something we need to evaluate.  I heard the Minister reference this area already.  I appreciate that.<\/p>  <p>  Delivering high-quality special needs education and supporting the children and families who rely on such services should be a priority of the Minister and the Department.  Affording all children equal opportunity to obtain the support and education they need to excel in their later life is a moral responsibility of the State.  I hope the Minister will pursue this goal and will engage with families, schools and experts as to how to achieve it.  I also hope the voice of the children themselves will be listened to during such a process.  On seven or eight occasions, I heard the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, say that the voice of the child needs to be heard.  As outgoing chair of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, on which I worked with colleagues, I know that was a key aspect of the process emphasised by the Department of the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, the committee and Tusla.<\/p> <p>It is heartening to hear the Minister, the former Minister and the Department focus on what is an important aspect of the learning process the Department has to undertake on an annual basis.  Listening to the child is an extremely important part of that process.<\/p> <p> An increasing number of special needs assistants, 17,000 in total, are being provided for this coming September.  That is welcome but there is a clear issue with regard to how the evaluation is made.  Although great strides have been made, there is always room for improvement.  As has been echoed by our colleague, having a Minister who is herself a former practitioner of education, may provide additional light as to how we can streamline the SNA allocation process to support both schools and children.  By doing just that, we can achieve greater strengthening of special needs classes in mainstream schools and support the vital work carried out by special needs assistants.  There has been significant progress in this field since 2011 and I hope the present Ministers will work to improve it further.<\/p> <p> Gifted children should have the opportunity to reach their potential according to their talent and passion rather than their age.  They should be encouraged and developed by the Department.  For too many years Ireland has not met such students with the sort of support that is required.  The system has been described as rigid and bureaucratic from time to time, which can lead to unintended consequences and lost opportunities when it comes to the progress of students.  I believe we have a golden opportunity now to commence the process of creating a more flexible and adaptive system that supports students that can kick-start the sort of changes that were mentioned earlier in developing a child throughout his or her educational career.<\/p> <p> Likewise, I am pleased that the July provision has been expanded to include students with Down's syndrome who were previously omitted from this programme.  The programme is relied upon by approximately 10,000 students every year.  However, the aspects of this programme can be of benefit to even more students.  Expanding the accessibility of the programme to a greater number of students with different abilities can be achieved should the goal be adopted by the Minister.  Any such review of the programme should consider the extensive paperwork burden placed on parents applying for the programme and the implementation of a streamlined user-friendly approach to accessing this hugely important and progressive programme.  I cannot emphasise that enough.  The sort of paperwork that parents are required to complete is burdensome.  The Minister would know that, as would all of our colleagues in the Seanad who are approached to assist parents with filling out paperwork, in particular when it applies to the Department of Education and Skills.  If we are being inundated, there is always more, and I believe we should attempt to do our best to streamline it.  Moreover, the Minister may consider reviewing the process of schools that choose to opt out of the programme despite having children enrolled who would qualify and benefit from participation in it, as well as examining the creation of a more integrated system of registration for both parents and tutors.  That is an issue.  Every school in the country will have children who would ordinarily qualify, and while in this scenario there are home-based programmes available, it is not always possible to secure a tutor and, therefore, children miss out.  We should use this process to evaluate that.<\/p> <p> I have only 90 seconds remaining.  I would very much appreciate a written response if that is possible.  Many changes in Irish society have their roots in the opening up, accessibility and progression of our education system.  This has led to economic, social and cultural benefits for our people.  Enhancing this approach to our education system should be an important part of the Department's future policies.  I am therefore pleased that the programme for Government has committed to a review of the national action plan on bullying, which will specifically aim to include guidelines for tackling gender-identity bullying.  Recent surveys and studies of bullying in schools, highlight that LGBT students are disproportionately affected by bullying in Irish schools.  While welcome, the review should form part of a wider review of how LGBT issues are approached in schools with the express aim of creating a safer and more welcoming environment for young people struggling with their orientation and identity.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on those remarks.  I will finish by reiterating what I said at the start, which is to wish all four new Ministers all the very best.  I did not name the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, and I wish to do so.  In the absence of the line committees this debate provides an opportunity for all of us to make constructive contributions to the Minister but it would be worthwhile for the Ministers to start pushing for the committee structures to be established so that we can get that process started.  As the Minister for Education and Skills in particular would know, as the decisions are made perhaps towards the middle or end of this month when the D&aacute;il might not be in session, there will no doubt be calls for the return of the D&aacute;il so that the education system can be debated in this Chamber.  We need to be wise to that.  We have one to two weeks remaining of the D&aacute;il sitting before our very short summer break and it is an opportunity for the Ministers to collectively call for those committees to be established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600039#PP00400","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594913400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her statement.

I have broken them down into two three-minute questions and one two-minute question.  Upskilling the construction sector workforce with retrofitting skills will be part of the just transition to create a circular economy and a fairer, sustainable future.  The Government has committed to this.  Retrofitting will help us reach the 2030 and 2050 climate reduction targets.  It also gives us the chance to create secure jobs in the construction sector for years to come.  Not only that, but retrofitting houses will lift people out of fuel poverty and protect the nation's most vulnerable.

I wish the various Ministers well and hope to work with them.<\/p>  <p>  I feel very strongly about access to education and educational disadvantage and I congratulate the Minister on announcing a new free book scheme.  A pilot scheme was included in the budget last year, proposed in the programme for Government, and has now been delivered upon.  A total of 102 schools will avail of a free book scheme in September, and that is the kind of initiative that the Labour Party wants to work with the Government to roll out throughout the country.  I congratulate the Minister on that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask a very direct question.  It has come to my attention that the Department has now conceded that the leaving certificate results will not now be announced until the first week in September.  Is the Minister in a position to confirm this?  If that is the situation, what preparations is the Department making for this eventuality?  The assumption heretofore was that the leaving certificate results would become available on pretty much the same date as they always have.  However, if it is to happen in the first week of September, if that is the situation, and if the Department is working towards that end, what impact is that going to have on third level institutions, apart from the mental health strain on the young people going through this process who have already been extremely challenged?  If that is the situation, will the Minister clarify that and give a commitment that, one hopes, that is not the case and that the leaving certificate results will be published at the same time as was expected, in mid-August?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600041#RR00600","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1594914000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>We are just out of time but the Minister may respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600041#RR00700","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1594914000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement of the free books scheme.

I wish the new Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, well in his work, which is so important for many individuals, families and communities throughout the country.  I have worked with the Minister of State on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly over the years.  We both saw at first hand the value and importance of going out and meeting with groups and communities and hearing at first hand the issues of concern to people.<\/p>  <p>  I say that in the context of the value that I believe the Minister of State will derive from going out and meeting with groups delivering services to people suffering through substance abuse.  It is important that the work of the Minister of State is informed of the core issues through the departmental briefing and also through the work of the service providers.  As I have done in previous D&aacute;il debates, I wish to highlight the particular challenges facing the Cavan Drug Awareness, CDA, Trust, which provides drug and alcohol rehabilitation services in Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  It has received financial support over the years from the North Eastern Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Force.  The current funding model is fundamentally flawed in that it is static for existing projects.  For more than eight years, the funding provided to the CDA Trust has been static.  This is a reduction in funding in the face of costs increasing constantly.  Some additional funds were made available for new initiatives, but the projects that already operate must do so on a continually diminishing budget and this is not sustainable.  <\/p>  <p>  The CDA Trust project in Cavan and Monaghan has had to raise additional funding to remain operational.  This is not sustainable, particularly with the difficulties in fundraising now.  As a society, we cannot afford to lose such important services.  I am very familiar with the work of the CDA Trust and I have visited the centre on many occasions.  I know and appreciate the commitment and dedication of the manager, Tim Murphy, and his staff colleagues, as well as the commitment of Padraig McBreen, the chairman of the board, and all his voluntary committee colleagues.  <\/p>  <p>  I know many people who have benefited from the services provided by the centre.  Unfortunately, many others need that support now and the suffering caused by drugs will not end tomorrow or the next day, sadly.  Those community service providers need increased financial support and a new funding model.  In society, there are more and more addiction problems and in many areas the only support service providers are community-led groups.  We need to build on the expertise of these providers and meet the growing demand for such services.  Without increased funding for such projects, they will fail and that will mean a huge loss to many communities.  <\/p>  <p>  The task forces are becoming increasingly sidelined.  The local partnership model has been eroded and the community and voluntary response to drug and alcohol issues is becoming increasingly HSE-led.  I believe this is a negative development.  We all know the HSE has more than enough challenges.  Why should we not utilise to the greatest extent possible the partnership and voluntary approach, which was the model that was put in place?  I appeal to the Minister of State that in reviewing the whole area of the provision of services to help with addiction problems that he will put the task force at the centre of the decision-making process and bring those task forces back to the role originally envisaged back in the mid-1990s.

Deputy Smith and I have had some very interesting meetings over the years in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  The work that he has done with all the other Members of this Parliament, the Oireachtas and all the stakeholders has been vital.  I look forward to meeting people on the ground.  The Deputy is right in that there is nothing better than going out and meeting all the various organisations and stakeholders and seeing at first hand what is happening on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  As the newly-appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to implementing that strategy.  Measuring the overall effectiveness of the response to the drug problem is an important objective of our drugs policy.  As the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, I believe that State resources should be directed towards interventions and strategies that are most likely to lead to a reduction in problem substance use and an improvement in public health, safety and well-being.  <\/p>  <p>  I advise the Deputy that the Department of Health allocates about &euro;28 million annually via drug and alcohol task forces to support 280 community projects aimed at tackling problem drug and alcohol use throughout the country.  I am aware that the CDA Trust provides a range of valuable services to individuals, families and the wider community affected by drug and alcohol use and misuse in Cavan and Monaghan.  Funding of &euro;937,800 is provided to the North Eastern Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Force annually.  I understand that the task force recommended funding of &euro;212,000 to the CDA Trust in 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the CDA has been provided with a full-year allocation as per the service-level agreement.  <\/p> <p>The CDA Trust also received funding from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to provide a drug rehabilitation community employment scheme.<\/p> <p> I will respond to the Deputy's particular concerns.  I understand the CDA Trust has entered negotiations with Merchants Quay Ireland to place the service provision under the MQI governance structures.  These negotiations had to be delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but I can advise the Deputy that the HSE now expects an update on progress in September 2020.<\/p> <p> In 2019 the Department provided funding of &euro;190,000 over 36 months until mid-2022 for a strategic initiative to improve access to health services for young people in Cavan and Monaghan whose lives are affected by problematic alcohol and substance misuse.  This is for young people substance misuse support services.<\/p> <p> The HSE has provided additional funding to addiction services in the Cavan-Monaghan area in 2020 to enhance service provision to the adult and under-18 age groups.  The adult services have been provided with funding for an additional counsellor, a nurse and administrative resources.  The under-18 service has been provided with funding to recruit a clinical nurse specialist and a counsellor to enhance the tier 3 multidisciplinary addiction team for those under 18 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600047#YY00700","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594917600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I welcome that the Minister of State is taking up my suggestion to visit and meet the groups and practitioners who are literally at the coalface.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to visit Cavan and meet that group early in his Ministry.  I expect the Minister of State would be highly impressed by their work and commitment.  There are people working there who went through the service and who are now helping to deliver services to people who have addiction problems.<\/p>  <p>  I am familiar with the negotiations between the Cavan project and Merchants Quay Ireland.  I know from reading some of the material produced by Merchants Quay Ireland that the organisation is exceptionally good in its analysis of what needs to be done in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the funding for the new initiatives.  We must ensure, however, that annual funding for projects that have been in existence for some time, delivering results for so many individuals and families, is not being reduced in real terms.  Let us consider the Cavan project.  It has received practically the same funding for the past nine years.  In view of increased costs in every respect, this means a reduction in the level of funding available annually.  That is not sustainable.  Those involved have been under extraordinary pressure to keep these important services going.  They have raised money through the usual fundraising avenues.  We all know, however, that the fundraising mechanism is not available at present.  It has not been available since mid-March.  There are serious difficulties for organisations and service providers that depend increasingly on raising funding in the community.  It is important that the Minister puts the regional task force back at the centre of the provision of these necessary services.<\/p>  <p>  The model was a good one when it was initially developed.  It has worked well over the years.  It needs to be rejuvenated and regenerated while working alongside the HSE.  We have the expertise and there is a proven track record by service providers.  Let us build on that expertise, keep the partnership and keep the voluntary ethos.  I know the people on the board in the Cavan project, who are providing services to persons in Cavan and Monaghan, give so willingly of their time, knowledge and expertise.  When the Minister of State has an opportunity to meet that group, he will see at first hand the value of this project and the need to ensure it survives and provides the services that are so needed by so many individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1594917600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.

In addition to the dramatic fall-off in passengers at Shannon Airport, the closure and restricted openings of some Shannon Heritage sites means that the impact on the group has been particularly severe.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that tourism is one of the most directly affected sectors in the current crisis.  The impact of Covid-19 on tourism globally has been overwhelming and immediate, with unprecedented consequences for Ireland's tourism and hospitality sector.  Since last February, officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have engaged with industry bodies with a view to understanding the challenges facing the sector.  The Department established a Covid-19 tourism monitoring group made up of industry stakeholders, the tourism agencies and Department officials to monitor the disruption to the sector and assist in formulating the its response to the crisis.   My Department has also liaised with other Departments and industry representative bodies to align the economy-wide Covid-19 supports and initiatives with tourism and hospitality needs.  The Government will continue to explore the funding potential for all enterprises, including tourism businesses such as Shannon Heritage, as it works through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU state aid framework.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government will publish a series of immediate actions to support the economy through the July stimulus.  In this context, the Government will, among other things, consider further additional measures that may be need to support the tourism and hospitality sector.  A tourism recovery task force was established on 20 May 2020 to prepare a tourism recovery plan that will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment.  The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the period 2020 to 2023.<\/p>  <p>  On 25 June the task force published an initial report recommending a number of measures it had identified that will help to save jobs and businesses across the tourism sector from now to the end of 2020.  The task force has already undertaken a widespread stakeholder consultation process whereby all sectors and interested parties could provide constructive inputs and innovative ideas on how this vital sector of our economy can adapt and recover in a meaningful and substantial way.  As I understand it, the task force will continue to engage with stakeholders as it seeks to finalise its work over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed and rolled out a suite of training and advisory supports for tourism businesses to enable them to respond to the challenges and threats now being faced in the sector.  It has also set up a Covid-19 industry advisory group which meets fortnightly.  The purpose of this group is to provide support to the tourism industry and facilitate the rapid sharing of information and insight to help improve the sector's understanding of and response to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  To assist tourism businesses reopening in line with the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has published guidelines for the sector, prepared in consultation with the industry and relevant authorities.  These guidelines are intended to assist businesses in meeting the requirements of the return to work safety protocol and are based on the latest health advice.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also unveiled its new national domestic marketing campaign, Ireland, make a break for it, to the tourism and hospitality sector industry recently.  This campaign involves a major drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks this summer.  It has also launched a new Covid-19 safety charter initiative designed to boost public confidence in the safety of businesses as the sector reopens.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the devastating effect of Covid-19 on the aviation industry and the Shannon Group in particular.

It is nothing personal; this is business.<\/p><p>As the Minister knows, the memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the FAI is a Shane Ross production.<\/p> <p>His ghost is very much alive as we see.  It was very much drawn from the same ether as his failed judicial appointments Bill, where he wanted everybody under the sun to be independent without the appropriate expertise to run the show.  Naturally, as a Parliament we prevented that proceeding.  I am sure the Minister played a part in that himself and it is important that he did.  Thankfully, that ridiculous and absurd legislation did not proceed.<\/p> <p> It seems, however, that this memorandum of understanding, MOU, is proceeding.  I am a bit confused whether the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan is in charge or whether it is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin or the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.  In any event, I took some solace and encouragement from a media report last week when the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, first took up his post in the Custom House.  The media report said he assembled the assistant secretaries, the Secretary General and all the senior staff and told them how things were going to be.  I was very encouraged and delighted to see that approach.<\/p> <p> Meanwhile, however, in the Minister, Deputy Ryan's, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and whatever else is in there, the Secretary General assembled the Ministers and told them how things were going to be, because they signed a letter telling the chairman of the FAI they would stand 100% behind the MOU.  This is the same MOU that wants the same ridiculous absurd independent majority to run football, which puts the FAI as an outlier in the world so that people can pull the strings from afar.  Instead of the corruption of the past, it will be a new form of corruption.  Spurious allegations are going around at present about tenders being given for Covid-19 testing and how the chairman, the interim CEO and the deputy CEO were put into their respective positions.  Of course, all three were members of the visionary group.<\/p> <p> I have raised many questions about this.  Before he was Taoiseach, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party leader suggested to me that if in government, we would review the MOU.  I agreed 100% and promoted it in the media as such but the engine had not gone cold in the Minister's car when he went into the Department to ensure the Shane Ross lunacy is going to continue.<\/p> <p> Why did the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, not sign the letter if he was in charge?  Can he answer that question?  It prohibits good hard-working directors who served in the past, who stood up to the previous regime and were thrown under the bus under the eyes and blessing, no doubt, of Sport Ireland, from serving on any committee in the future.  The last thing we want is a bit of expertise around the place that knows about football.<\/p> <p> In any event, the main crux of this issue is I believe the chairman acted beyond his authority in signing this on behalf of the FAI.  Now the Minister has gone ahead and has lent &euro;212,000 per month.  Three payments have been made thus far, in January, February and March, perhaps illegally and perhaps exposing the State to never getting paid again.  Article 3(8) of the constitution of the Football Association of Ireland states that the board of management shall not at any time borrow any sum in excess of &euro;1.27 million without the express sanction of the council in line with section 158 of the Companies Act 2014.<\/p> <p> Here is the situation.  We have lent out, thus far, &euro;632,000.  As the FAI did not give authority to the chairman to borrow that money, theoretically, we are losing money; we might never get paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600049#AAA00800","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594918800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

The Deputy will recall that since the scale of the governance of financial mismanagement within the FAI became clear over the past year, the FAI has been in a financial crisis the likes of which has never been faced by an Irish sporting body.  On 30 January, the then Government took the decision to ensure the survival of the association by approving an agreement to participate in a joint funding package for the FAI.  The MOA which was signed by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, and Mr. Roy Barrett, chairperson of the FAI, was an important and necessary measure in enabling the Government to participate in that financial support package.<\/p>  <p>  The MOU enabled Sport Ireland to restore funding to the FAI of &euro;2.9 million per annum and to provide additional annual funding of &euro;2.9 million for football development up to 2023.  It also provides for a repayable grant of just over &euro;7.6 million to the FAI to pay its license fee for the Aviva Stadium up to 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The MOU sets out the conditions for receipt of this funding including necessary constitutional and council reform and corporate governance and financial reforms.  The conditions were accepted by the FAI and the other relevant stakeholders, namely, UEFA and the Bank of Ireland.  Sport Ireland remains in communication with the FAI in matters relating to its governance and financial management.  It has established a process to oversee and review adherence by the association to the commitments given in the MOU.<\/p>  <p>  The FAI has committed to implementing certain recommendations on governance reform and Sport Ireland expects to be in a position to restore funding to the association when these commitments are verifiably honoured.  To be clear, the conditions in the MOU must be implemented in full.  There will be no renegotiation of the terms of the MOU.  The FAI must convene an extraordinary general meeting, EGM, this month to implement rule changes to provide for an increase to six independent directors on its board and for those members of the FAI council with more than ten years' service to stand down.  If these rule changes are not implemented Sport Ireland, will be unable to disburse any funds to the FAI, including the Covid-19 support funding approved by the Government last month.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the then Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Calleary, wrote to the chairman of the FAI last Thursday to confirm that the new Government would not reopen any discussion on part of the MOU agreed by the previous Government.  We confirmed that the conditions for governance reform were essential to rebuild public trust and to enable the disbursement of the funding package set out in the MOU and we confirmed our support for Sport Ireland to liaise with the FAI and to verify implementation of the governance and financial control requirements as agreed in January. <\/p>  <p>  While we respect the autonomy of the national governing bodies of sport, we cannot tolerate a situation where the mismanagement of a funded body brings its very survival into question.  The FAI board and council ultimately failed in their duty to the association and its members, the grassroots clubs and volunteers, to hold the executive leadership to account.  This is why the Government had top step in to provide additional funding to safeguard the future of Irish soccer and the livelihoods of more than 200 people employed by the FAI.  We could not ignore the findings of the KOSI auditors that the FAI in its previous form was not fit to receive public funding.  We will be monitoring carefully the progress on reform and if there are any concerns we are seeing a return to the old FAI, we will not hesitate to suspend funding once again.<\/p>  <p>  Irish soccer, like all sport in Ireland, has faced an unprecedented challenge this year and the return to sport will not be easy.

There will be no change and the former Minister, Mr. Ross, is enjoying the irony out in the leafy hills of Enniskerry.  The MOU says that the offer of the Minister should in no way be regarded as a binding commitment in the context of a contractual agreement etc. and the MOU will be underpinned by a series of relevant legal documents.  The reality is State funds, some &euro;212,000 per month since January, have been given to the Aviva Stadium in the name of the FAI, which it is supposed to repay.  Under its own constitution it has not approved this at any meeting of its council.  Therefore, the first point is the State is now exposed to the repayment of that money.  The second is that if the forthcoming EGM declines to give approval to borrow this money then, arguably, the signatory is potentially on the hook but it will not be the FAI because those concerned were acting above their authority in any event.<\/p> <p>All the Minister has done is read the same dribble that we are all used to.  We all supported the Government supporting the FAI in cleaning it up.  Nobody wants it to be cleaned up more than the grassroots ordinary five eighths, but we have shipped in total elitism.  A small group of people have designed their version of what good governance is.  It is a disgrace.<\/p> <p> The Minister spoke about the clubs and the grassroots.  Honestly, if he stands over what he said, he does not give a twopenny damn about the grassroots.  What we have now is an MOU which has no legal status.  The Minister has already started to pay out on it, even though many of the recommendations that he said must be met have not been met.  They have not even been formally put to the council yet.  The chairman, whoever he is - exceptional, professional, brilliant at his job and above reproach - did not have the authority under his own rules.  We sent in two Ministers to sign a letter, presumably at the behest of the Secretary General, which potentially put the State on the hook for millions of euro without even the approval of the organisation itself.

According to the context of the regulation, this prohibition would apply specifically in wetlands, but the provision is so broad that it would essentially mean the ban would apply across the board.  The fundamental problem I have is that the vote was to take place today.  Most of the people who would have been affected by it had absolutely no idea that it was due to take place.  It has been postponed now.  I urge the Government to ensure, first of all, that a consultation with those people who would be affected by this regulation takes place - I had been calling on the previous Government to do this for a number of years - because the costs and the impact could be quite substantial.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, can the Minister of State confirm that the Government will follow on from the previous Government's intention to vote \"No\" on this regulation when it comes before it?  When it gets the opportunity, will it reject this regulation?  Will the Minister of State outline what the Government has been doing to defeat this regulation, knowing that it is unworkable and unthinkable and would add a hugely significant cost to farmers, who account for half of the ownership of guns in the State, and game club members?  These are precisely the people we need on board if we are to ensure these types of conservation policies work.  Enacting such a proposition without any consultation for them is counterproductive when it comes to promoting good conservation policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600051#CCC00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1594919400,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I am not at all surprised that the European Commission has been unable to get support in the REACH committee due to the fundamental problems with the proposals.  Did the European Commission forget about the presumption of innocence?  An extremely important principle in EU law is that the burden of proof is on the prosecution, yet these proposals would have seen that burden move to the person.  The person would have been responsible for proving that he or she had been outside wetlands when he or she used lead shot.  There was nothing in the proposal to give a clear and precise understanding of people's rights and obligations and nothing in it to require the courts to ensure those rights and obligations are observed.<\/p>  <p>  The definition of wetlands under the Ramsar Convention could not be less clear.  It includes peatlands - all of them - and a 1 sq. m area of temporary water.  Where I come from, they are called puddles.  They come from rain, and then they disappear.  When one adds on to this the 100 m buffer zone, not only does one get widespread confusion but one gets something that is completely unenforceable.  That definition meant wetlands would literally change with the weather.  Bizarrely, the proposal meant it would have been perfectly fine to fire lead shot towards a wetland as long as it was 100 m away.<\/p>  <p>  It is also strange that there was no reference in any way, either explicit or implied, to the use of lead gunshot by military or by the police falling under these regulations.

If it is okay, I will provide the House with some background information in relation to it.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, AEWA, was developed under the UN Convention on Migratory Species.  Ireland signed up to the agreement in 2003.  The agreement includes a commitment that \"Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables.\"  Ireland's position is to support the AEWA commitment to phase out the use of lead shot over wetlands.  Separately, the European Commission published a set of draft regulations in early 2019 for consideration by member states on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands.  The draft regulation has been discussed by member states at some meetings of the REACH committee.<\/p>  <p>  Following a discussion at the most recent REACH committee meeting in June 2020, the Commission submitted a draft set of regulations for a vote by member states by written procedure.  The main proposals in the regulation published in June 2020 on the use of lead gun shot in and around wetlands would involve a transitional period of 24 months for those member states banning the use of lead gun shot in and around wetlands.  The transition time for member states with wetlands that exceed 20% of their territory would be extended to 36 months, as long as they ban the purchase and use of lead shot in all their territory and not just wetlands.  The regulation also proposes that there would be fixed buffer zones of 100 m around wetlands, where lead shot possession and shooting would be prohibited.  Finally, as Deputy Clarke has mentioned, it is proposed to adopt the definition of wetlands that is used in the Ramsar Convention.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the underlying thrust of the regulation and its protection for the environment and water birds.  Like some other member states, we currently have no restrictions on the use of lead shot over wetlands.  In those member states which have already introduced some national regulation, gun owners would already have non-lead ammunition and the lead-in time set out in the draft regulations would seem appropriate.<\/p> <p> However, as we currently have no restriction, statutory or otherwise, in place on the use of lead in gunshot, we would be placed in the most difficult position of having to catch up to implement and properly enforce a new EU regulation in 24 months in an area in which other member states are already advanced in respect of national regulation on the transition to new weapons, of compliance and of education of the public, and gun users in particular.  The guns of many Irish farmers and hunters are not capable of using lead shot substitutes.  These farmers and hunters would need to purchase new guns.  In addition, the proposed definition of wetlands is that of the Ramsar convention on wetlands of international importance, which includes peatlands.  This would cover extensive areas around the country.  Unfortunately, these Ramsar areas are not all mapped and, given the scale of wetlands in Ireland, this would take some time so action on enforcement would present real problems.<\/p> <p> While the Commission has proposed to progress this measure, I believe it is time we received some support on this matter.  Although Ireland is supportive of the aims of the regulation and is committed to implementing them, the lead-in time proposed by the Commission would present Ireland with difficulties and we will seek to have this addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600051#CCC00500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594920000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Beidh n&oacute;im&eacute;ad amh&aacute;in agam agus n&oacute;im&eacute;ad ag an Teachta Clarke.

The Government cannot take anything other than outright opposition to this regulation prior to consultation with those people who will be affected by it.  As is the case with any legislation, and particularly with EU regulations, there are always unforeseen consequences that only people at the coalface will be able to address.  There is a major financial implication but there are also major conservation implications for those who are carrying out very positive conservation functions for us all in their local areas.  I again request that the Minister of State commit the Government to opposing this at every turn and, in the interim, carrying out a full consultation process with those who will potentially be affected by its inaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600052#DDD00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1594920000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I have heard and listened to what the Minister of State has said.

As I have already stated in my response, my Department is fully aware of the difficulties hunters and landowners may encounter in sourcing alternative ammunition or guns should the Commission regulation come into force.  We are fully supportive of the ban on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands given the environmental threats posed by lead in the environment.  At the same time, my Department has liaised directly with farming and hunting stakeholders and is acutely aware of the challenges involved.  In addition to the challenges I have already outlined, the Commission's proposals for buffer zones of 100 m around wetlands add difficulty in trying to resolve these issues and enforce new restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  We believe that the transition period of two years proposed by the Commission before the regulation comes into force in member states is too short, given that we are one of four members states that do not currently have any restrictions.  Given the difficulties in terms of implementation, Ireland has argued that the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, REACH, committee could push for a longer transition period.  I cannot specify how long that period would be but we will continue to seek a longer transition period to incorporate the regulation.  I will certainly take up Deputy Clarke's offer.
