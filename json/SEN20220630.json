Amendment No. 125 makes provision for the EPA to accept and to process licence applications in line with existing provisions under subsections 181(2)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(2A) of the Planning and Development Act, which currently it is unable to do.  Section 87 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 sets out the requirements to which the EPA must adhere when assessing an application for a licence or a review of a licence.  In order to accept a licence application for an activity that involves development which requires a grant of permission under the Planning and Development Act 2000, an application for planning permission or a specified approval must have been made or a grant of permission or specified approval under the Planning and Development Act 2000 must be in place.  Section 87 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 does not refer to the new provisions of section 181 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 that were inserted in 2021.  Amendments are required to ensure that the EPA can examine a licence application and, if that application is successful, grant a licence or a revised licence in accordance with the new provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  These changes are simply to update and to align the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 with the amendments made to the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The intention is to amend the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 in order that an application for approval under section 87 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 will also include an application for approval under section 181(2A) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Similarly, it is intended to amend the definition of &quot;grant of permission&quot; in section 87 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to include an order signed under section 181(2)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Without these amendments, those making temporary electricity generation proposals now being prepared to progress through section 181 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 would not legally be able to apply for or to obtain the necessary environmental licence in order to operate.  The amendment I seek to make is an enabling one and will allow for the seamless linking of licence application and process, as envisaged in the 2021 changes made to the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The full independence of the EPA in determining whether to grant or to refuse licence applications is not affected by this amendment.  The EPA remains fully independent in that function and there is no statutory role for a Government Minister in that regard.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 126 creates a new Part in the Electricity Regulation Act to transpose the requirement in Article 59.1(b) of the internal market in electricity directive to give the Commission for Regulation of Utilities the power to ensure compliance by market participants that are not electricity undertakings with their obligations under the directive.  These market participants include smaller actors in the electricity market, including citizen energy communities that are not engaged in the activity as their main business or economic activity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Therefore, it is not appropriate to subject these actors to the more onerous licensing regime already in existence for electricity undertakings.  This a significant new development in the Irish electricity regulatory framework, creating a regulatory framework for the participation of new actors in the electricity market and is an essential step in providing new ways for customers and a greater diversity of actors, including citizen energy communities, to participate in the market via electricity activities, including generating and trading electricity, aggregation, demand response and energy storage.  Therefore, this is an important component in building resilience in the electricity market in Ireland and will help to accelerate the decarbonisation and democratisation of the market.  By doing so, this new framework acts upon the European Commission&rsquo;s call to speed up the transposition of the internal market for electricity directive which is the subject of a letter of formal notice and which is designed to effectively allow consumers to participate in energy markets as set out in the European Commission&rsquo;s recent communication RePowerEU, which sets out the Commission&rsquo;s response to the war in Ukraine.  <\/p><p>There is a double urgency to transform Europe's energy system, namely, to end the EU's dependence on Russian fossil fuels and to tackle the climate crisis.  The shift away from fossil fuels towards renewables is part of the circular transition as provided for in the circular economy strategy.  The strategy is a key addition to Government&rsquo;s drive to achieve a 51% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to get on a path to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050.  The less we use non-renewable material resources like fossil fuels, the more circular and less resource-intensive the economy becomes.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 provides for the immediate commencement of these provisions on the enactment of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 75, 101, 118, 121 and 127 provide for a change in the Long and Short Titles to the Bill to the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill to take account of these changes.<\/p><p>In regard to Senator O'Reilly's disallowed amendment regarding flimsy plastic cups, the Senator has addressed an important issue which has been part of public debate in recent weeks.  My Department is aware of the concerns from both retailers and cup manufacturers that the flimsy plastic cups to which the Senator refers could become a feature of the market and be provided to customers at no charge which could be a way to avoid the levy.  Such a scenario could result in increased plastic waste.  This would be a bad environmental outcome and not one that the public and any environmentally responsible business would want to see.  This amendment would close that potential loophole.  I will look at introducing a reworded amendment on Report Stage to deal with that concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#A00800","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.

This whole Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill should be about ensuring a reduction of the usage of plastic in our economy.  If the Minister of State looks to the wider European approach, they have taken a more macro approach.  I am thinking of Italy and other countries, for example, that have looked at attempting to reduce the amount of plastic in the economy.<\/p> <p>I accept the issue that was raised in this country previously by the plastic bag tax.  At the time, it was principally a litter measure more so than a reduction of plastic measure.  It worked very well.  People were much more cautious about the purchase and usage of plastic bags.  It changed people's mindset.  For sure, there are many people who have issues around the paper cup and the way in which it contributes to litter throughout the country.  I am not so sure that the approach in this Bill is necessarily the right way to go about it for a whole variety of reasons.  Principally, the amount of plastic in a paper cup is so small.  I think the Government is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut when the consequence of moving people away from a paper cup with a relatively small amount of plastic contained internally for food safety purposes is for it to potentially be replaced by a strong, heavy plastic cup.  <\/p> <p>I would put on the record that there is a facility my in constituency, namely, a company called Cup Print, that employs many people.  However, that is not why I am making the case.  I tend not to parish-pump on important stuff such as this.  The reality is, we still have little plastic cups such as the one in front of the Minister of State.  We are not proposing any major elimination of those.  However, at the same time, we are proposing to try to eliminate the coffee cup.<\/p> <p>The reality is the vast majority of paper coffee cups with a very minute amount of plastic are compostable.  Plastic cups like the one in front of the Minister of State are not.  I have spoken to other elements of the industry and the expectation is that if the Government bans or puts a significant levy on what we know to be the paper coffee cup, the huge coffee industry will pivot towards the use of a reusable plastic cup.  We all have keep cups.  I have a couple in the car.  Some are metal and some are heavy plastic.  I have been shown plastic cups that can be produced for 10 cent to 15 cent.  The reality is, if we make the paper cup expensive by virtue of either a significant levy or attempt to ban it, it will be replaced.  People will continue to drink coffee.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding all our best efforts to have a reusable cup with us, the vast majority of coffee is purchased as an impulse buy.  There are statistics to that effect.  On my way to Leinster House, on occasion I will drop into Carol&rsquo;s coffee shop across road, namely, the Petite Caf&eacute;.  Carol does a great service.  I will take a paper cup.  I will dispose of it appropriately and that is the right thing to do.  However, if I do not have my keep cup with me and she provides me with a plastic cup, I will take that too.  I think I am just typical of a lot of people.<\/p> <p>I am very worried that what we are trying to do here, which is the right thing to do to eliminate the litter, may be creating a situation whereby we will end up producing much more plastic reusable cups.  However, because they will be produced relatively cheaply and will be of relatively poor quality, they will be disposable.  I am not suggesting they will all be littering the sides of the road; they may not.  They just go back into the trash can.  That is creating more of a demand for plastic.<\/p> <p>The amendments that I will be more interested in are about addressing that issue.  Perhaps it will be for rules and regulations the Government will bring forward at a later stage.  We need to be very cautious in moving from the litter issue.  Perhaps we need to have a broader view.  <\/p> <p>No different to most people in this House, to get head space, I walk or run.  When I go outside any village, within two miles of the village, when the foliage drops in the autumn and remains gone for the winter, I see an amazing amount of litter, from vodka bottles to Coke cans to cigarette wrappers, which all have plastic attached.  There are paper cups, but they rot away, while much of the other stuff does not.  I am just concerned that perhaps from a departmental point of view, this might seem like a nice headline: &ldquo;We banned the coffee cup because it is a blight on the landscape&rdquo;.  We need to look again entirely at the way we manage waste.  The model we have at the minute encourages people to be careless about waste because there is a charge on it.  Should we be looking at the collection of waste for free?  I would have discussed with the Minister for Transport on occasion about the idea of free public transport as a method of getting people away from using their car or taking unnecessary journeys in the car.  Sometimes one has to make a very big policy change in order to change behaviour.  Regarding litter and from a litter perspective, we should be moving towards some kind of municipal facilities, such as we do with bottle banks and used clothing.  We have to get there.  <\/p> <p>I talk regularly to my local authority about the lack of bins in some beauty spots.  The standard response from the top down is, \"But sure you cannot be putting bins there.  There will be domestic waste put in or around them.\"  We are looking at it backwards if we are trying to eliminate waste.  I see it throughout County Clare.  Too much waste is dumped at night on quiet roads, often in very beautiful areas where people like to walk, run and go for a scenic amenity.  However, the waste is there.  <\/p> <p>I would encourage perhaps the Minister of State or people within the overall architecture of government to come forward with a strategy to address litter - a very comprehensive one that involves education and encourages people to dispose of goods in a way that is much more sympathetic to the natural beauty of the environment.  That requires a free service in a certain number of areas.  The vast majority of people will adhere to and pay for the collection of their waste.  However, there needs to be some kind of a municipal facility where the State carries the burden for those who do not or do not want to do so.  It is a huge blight and it is not just coffee cups.  It is a problem.<\/p> <p>If the Minister of State takes a walk in the autumn along the road from any village, he will see the extent and amount of litter.  I think he will be surprised - perhaps he has seen it already &ndash; by the stuff that gets dumped with a much higher plastic content than what we are talking about.  I know the volumes are large here, but it is the quantum of plastic.  That is what the whole idea of this initiative was originally based around, that is, reducing the production of plastic, rather than the way it is discarded on the other end.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We will debate the amendments, but I just wanted to set out my thoughts behind the matter.

That is an entirely spurious argument, and the amendment would not and could not impose such a charge.  I proposed several amendments for parts of the legislation and each has been ruled out of order.  In these cases, there are fixed monetary amounts in the Bill that would be fixed in the Act.

These provide for charges.  The amounts of up to &euro;1 may be absolutely worthless in just a few years, or certainly in a decade or two.  The proposal I make is that instead of prescribing these restrictions within the legislation, the Minister should be given the power to vary them by means of regulations.

The end of the journey in this regard is to reduce waste.<\/p> <p>I am concerned about potential greenwashing by companies.  Even if a product is biodegradable or compostable by European Union standards, the reality is that if such items are put in the bin or are subject to the compost options available to us in this House, they will go into a regular bin.

Amendment No. 7 would ensure that, within the interpretation of what constitutes a single-use cup, items that contain 10% plastic content or less would be excluded from being subjected to a levy or a ban.  This outlines a better possibility by looking to the international implementations of the single-use plastics directive mentioned in the newspaper article in question.  Italy is a good example in this regard because it applies an environmental levy to products with a plastic content above the 10% level.  That is the key aspect.<\/p><p>Single-use items may be made of recyclable and renewable material.  As Senator Dooley said, some contain a wafer-thin level of plastic.  If the Bill focused on such items with the plastic content above this threshold, it would ensure that those products with the highest percentage of plastic would be the subject of a levy, thus facilitating an immediate 90% reduction in single-use plastic consumption.  The knock-on effect would be to encourage consumer behaviour to move away from the purchasing of single-use cups that are 100% plastic or at least have a greater plastic content than alternatives which contain 10% plastic or less.  We were doing some research on this but the article in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>really stands out in the context of international comparisons.

I am happy to consider those aspects at that stage.  Before we make regulations to put a levy on any particular item, it must go out to public consultation and that is provided for in the Bill.  That is the appropriate time to figure out what the exemptions will be and how it will be applied.<\/p><p>I agree with Senators McGahon and Dooley in that the definitions are important.  It is important that loopholes are not created and that we do not have unintended negative consequences.  A consideration of the plastic bag levy debate was what if it turned out that the bag for life was not really a bag for life.  A definition has to be put on what constitutes a reusable item and a single-use item.  It is important that we get that right.<\/p><p>As Senator Boylan said, we are not just trying to reduce plastic use.  We are trying to reduce single-use items regardless of what they are made of.  The whole idea of manufacturing a product and distributing it around the world, using resources when it is made of wood or plastic, for something that only gets used for a couple of minutes or seconds is part of the problem.  There are two problems: reducing plastic and reducing single-use items.  Part of the answer to reducing plastic is the single-use plastics directive.  We banned certain items last July in line with the EU directive, but there are other things happening within the Bill.  It requires that commercial waste be segregated.  Later this year, I will introduce the roll-out of a deposit return scheme through which plastic bottles will be recycled.  Different objectives are trying to be achieved.<\/p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly's disallowed amendment covers the same ground that Senators McGahon and Dooley are trying to address to make sure we do not have unintended consequences and a proliferation of cheap and flimsy plastic cups replacing paper cups.

The reason I am doing that is so that the Minister is not given too much power.  I do not want a situation in which the Minister could put a levy of &euro;100 on a cup of coffee, which would make no sense.  What we are creating is an executive power for the Minister to, following public consultation, issue a levy on an item that is bad for the environment, but there should be some limit.  Senator Ward is a barrister and will understand this better than me.  The executive powers that we create for Ministers in the future should not be huge and unlimited.  They need to have some kind of checks and balances on them.  They could be reversed by the courts where they are found to be too powerful.  What we have done is introduce a maximum charge of &euro;1.  This will allow for many years of inflation, I hope, before we reach that type of level.  If we did reach a point at which we needed a new levy, when a levy of &euro;1 is not enough on a single-use item, the Oireachtas could amend the legislation and change the amount.  That is a frequent pattern in legislation in that fixed amounts are put in for maximum rates.<\/p> <p>Regarding the proposal to introduce a 1 cent levy, such a levy would obviously have zero effect on behaviour.  If we put a 1 cent levy on everything, it would collect a lot of money but it would have no effect on behaviour.  As a result, I do not accept amendment No. 36 because I am willing to work through the regulations and examine the exemptions at that time.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 7, 34, 35, 37 to 40, inclusive, and 43 cumulatively appear to refocus the Bill on plastic single-use items rather than single-use items as a whole.  Achieving a circular transition is a much broader issue than just plastic.  The purpose of the levy is to influence people's behaviour away from single-use items, and not just plastic items, in all areas of our daily life.  Therefore, I do not accept the amendments.<\/p> <p>More than 22,000 disposable cups end up in landfill or incineration every day in Ireland.  That amounts to more than 200 million cups per year.  This figure includes cups that are recyclable. The objective of the policy is to reduce the annual consumption of all types of disposable cups and, subsequently, other forms of single-use disposable packing by inducing people to change their behaviour and switch to using reusable cups.  The objective of the levy is to change behaviour and prevent the use of single-use items in the first place and the continuous unnecessary use of resources that are required to go into the production and disposal of single-use items.<\/p> <p>I am willing to meet with Cup Print or any other company that might be negatively affected by the regulations.  When we are developing the regulations, I am willing to meet with any cafe operators or market participants who want to discuss how these measures will affect them.  The Finnish paper mill, Huhtamaki, which owns Cup Print, has made a lot of money out of paper straws.  It did not make any complaints about that when we switched to paper straws.  It has been a profitable transition for the company.  There are gains and losses, but what will not continue in the future is business as usual.  There will be many opportunities for change in the green economy, as well as many opportunities to make money through different kinds of products.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 42 provides for the lowering of the minimum rate of the levy.  We saw with the plastic bag levy that eventually the levy amount was too low to affect behaviour.  Plastic bag usage started to go up again and the levy needed to be raised slightly.  We saw a direct correlation between the size of the levy and the amount of usage of that product.  A 1 cent levy is too low.  I refer to the experience of other European countries.  The plastic bag levy in Lithuania and Latvia was set at 1 cent and 2 cent respectively.  Data shows that these small levies had a small effect, if any, on consumer behaviour.  They may have succeeded in collecting money but they did not succeed in changing behaviour.  That is the reason I will stick with a 20 cent levy.<\/p> <p>Regarding the experiences in Italy, the UK and other countries that have brought in plastic taxes, we have looked at those jurisdictions.  Rather than trying to tackle single-use items, they are particularly focused on plastic.  I have asked the Department to look at whether a plastic tax is appropriate in Ireland having regard to the plastic taxes in operation in other countries.  When such a tax is brought in, it increases the value of recycled plastic.  We are seeing a lot of plastic material being exported from Ireland to those countries where it has become a valuable commodity.  We will look at those jurisdictions, but we are trying to achieve two targets: the removal of single-use items and a reduction in plastic use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#E00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s bona fides in relation to charging.

This definition is the one Senators from all Opposition groups sought to insert into the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2021 last summer.  The reason we are seeking to insert this definition into the Bill comes from a core issue with it, which is that it is too narrowly focused on Ireland and the Irish economy as existing in isolation from the rest of the world, as if not impacting on the rest of the world.  Economic activity in wealthy countries such as Ireland is worsening the climate crisis for those in the global south.  We see famine in the Horn of Africa at present, we see agricultural land across the African continent becoming unusable and we see the worsening climate emergency causing death and destruction for those who have done the least to cause it.<\/p><p>This amendment defines climate justice as reflecting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change commitments on equity and &quot;common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities&quot; and requiring that the decisions and actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the effects of climate change should support the people who are most affected by climate change but who have done the least to cause it and are the least equipped to adapt to its effects, and safeguard the human rights of the most vulnerable persons.  The reason we have proposed this definition is because we have subsequent amendments which seek to incorporate these principles into the circular economy strategy, the programme and the wider provisions of this Bill.  This is necessary because we see examples of how economic activity in this country is negatively affecting people and the environment in the global south, such as with fast fashion for which I will be tabling amendments on Report Stage.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 seeks to insert a definition of &quot;just transition&quot; into the legislation.  It proposed to define just transition as a transition that ensures the economic, environmental and social consequences of the ecological transformation of economies and societies are managed in ways that maximise opportunities of decent work for all, reduce inequalities, promote social justice, and support industries, workers and communities negatively affected in accordance with nationally defined priorities and based on effective social dialogue.  This relates to later amendments on planned obsolescence and on precious metals.  We need to look at obsolescence in electronics and I will be tabling amendments in respect of this on Report Stage.  It also relates to the environmental levy.  I have concerns that we are only looking at consumption and not production.  I will be returning to these matters on Report Stage.<\/p><p>This amendment is necessary to ensure that this legislation operates in a way which is equitable, which seeks to reduce poverty and which is based on social justice.  When we are talking about transforming our economy and creating a circular economy, the measures that we take cannot be based solely on action at the point of consumption.  There are deep inequalities in our society and we need to make sure that our ideas about creating a circular economy are not based solely on the idea of changing consumer choices.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 15 seeks to insert a provision that the proposed circular economy fund shall consist of such accounts in such financial institutions as the Minister may determine, and that those financial institutions must be operating within the State.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 and most of the next set of amendments seek to add to the things which the circular economy fund might be used for.  Amendment No. 16 seeks to add that it may be used to assist the establishment, the equipping and, where appropriate, the operation of facilities which provide repair services.  The right to repair is a significant issue and something which is sorely lacking from this legislation.  In their pre-legislative scrutiny report on this legislation, the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action recommended that an examination should be conducted into the potential measures for addressing the challenge of planned obsolescence, particularly in relation to electronics.  This should include a broad examination of international examples and potential measures could include a right to repair.  In its submission to the committee, Voice Ireland recommended explicitly that a right to repair should be regulated for.  This issue relates to just transition.  There are examples from across the country of community repair facilities, such as repair caf&eacute;s and men's sheds.  This should be seen as a key part of where we can create decent work in a circular economy and reduce waste and the need for extraction for goods, particularly electronic goods.  It also is a way to counter planned obsolescence which I have amendments on later.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 17 is a minor amendment to subsection (9) which seeks to insert the word &quot;public&quot; before &quot;research&quot; in the provision that the Minister may pay moneys out of the fund to assist, support or promote research and development with respect to any aspect of waste management or the circular economy.  For the purpose of clarity, I will discuss amendments Nos. 17 and 19 together as they are deeply related.  Amendment No. 19 seeks to add a provision that money can be paid out of the fund to assist the establishment of public-public partnerships for research and development in the area of the circular economy and waste management.  Both of these amendments relate to a much wider issue affecting research in Ireland.  That is the fact that we are seeing a significant emphasis on research to develop a product to be marketed but nowhere near the same emphasis on frontier of blue-skies research and research for the public good.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 adds the provision that in dispensing money from the circular economy fund, the Minister can dispense funds to assist, support or promote initiatives to restore, conserve and renovate buildings in order to reduce embodied emissions resulting from demolition.  This is a significant issue.  While I note construction is included in the sectors to which the circular economy strategy will apply, there should be a mechanism for the fund to support initiatives to restore, conserve and renovate buildings.  My colleague, Senator Higgins, is a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action which over recent months has had a series of hearings on the renovation wave across Europe and different sustainable approaches to building.  What comes across is that the most sustainable building is the one that already exists, that is renovated and that maybe sometimes is extended or changed.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 20 seeks to add a new provision that the Minister can dispense funds from the circular economy fund to assist, support or promote actions or initiatives undertaken by international organisations or non-governmental organisations to further climate justice.  I have already discussed the broader need for climate justice to be reflected in this Bill but this amendment is something tangible we could do to further climate justice.  There are international organisations and NGOs which are advocating strongly for climate justice and we need to support them in their advocacy in relation to the circular economy and promoting more equitable and sustainable economic policies.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 21 seeks to add a new provision that the Minister can dispense funds from the circular economy fund to assist, support or promote actions undertaken by indigenous community groups internationally to protect the environment or to curb or oppose the extraction or exploitation of natural resources.  We have seen across the world resistance to that dispossession and to the extraction and exploitation of land and natural resources, for example, the resistance of indigenous communities in North America at Standing Rock, which the Dakota Access Pipeline passes through.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Another is the resistance of the indigenous communities to a pipeline being built through territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation in Canada.  There are numerous other examples of land-grabbing and resistance across America and Africa but the core point is we should be supporting those who seek to stop extraction at its source.  They often face great violence while trying to do so.  This comes back to the core point of broadening the concept of the circular economy to the global dimension, which the committee recommended in its pre-legislative scrutiny report.  We cannot simply look at consumption.  We need to support those who resist exploitation of the natural resources used in products we are seeking to regulate.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 22 is again about transparency.  I am concerned at the use of the phrase \"other persons outside the State\".  It is very broad and should be defined more specifically.  I am not going to press the amendment but perhaps the Minister of State might bring his own amendment or by regulation prescribe descriptions of persons who can avail of funding, just as a safeguard.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 23 is another amendment seeking to improve transparency and accountability in the legislation.  It seeks to add that when a committee is established under section 8(14) to advise the Minister with respect to the performance by him or her of his or her functions under section 8(9) or section 8(12) that where a member of a committee established under section 8(14) has a material interest in a matter under consideration by the committee, he or she must declare that interest and subsequently recuse himself or herself from deliberations.<\/p><p>Amendments that effectively have the same effect as this group have been accepted with respect to both the Land Development Agency Act and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act.  This will improve transparency and accountability and ensure people who have financial or other interests in something under the consideration of a committee are not involved in the decision on what advice to give the Minister or in directly advising the Minister.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.<\/p><p>As a final point on the topic of just transition, we know particular communities feel the impact of climate change more severely than others.  They pay a higher price in responding to the climate crisis.  We cannot further compound inequality and disadvantage.  Any transition must be just and fair.  If we consider the strategies to respond to the climate crisis contained within this Bill and related to these amendments, some very evidently compound existing inequality and are in conflict with the principles of a just transition.  Take, for example, the provisions regarding the installation of CCTV schemes in local authority areas or the use of personal recording devices by authorised officers to deter, prevent, detect and prosecute offences under the Bill.  Particular areas and communities are surveilled more frequently and more intensely than others and that is likely to be compounded by the provisions within this Bill on CCTV and surveillance without adequate safeguarding.  A just transition is based on a social dialogue.  Instead of looking at a model of policing and surveillance, the burden of which will be felt more severely by particular communities, we must ensure we respond to the climate crisis through social dialogue and just and equitable transition.  We will get to some of those later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#F02000","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

Later on, we hope we will be able to bring amendments on Report Stage around that idea of the right to repair because it is an important element of just transition.  It mitigates against planned obsolescence because those who have less means are not always able to constantly buy stuff and it is up to us as legislators to ensure manufacturers are not building obsolescence into their products to force people to buy new products.  It is likewise with the right to repair.  You should be able to repair products as a fundamental right and we need to remove the barriers on that.<\/p> <p>We also have amendments around civic amenity because not only is it relevant to the earlier discussion on littering, it also relates to the just transition as there are people across this State who do not have the same access to civic amenity sites.  The hours are different and in some cases the tariffs are substantially different.  For example, in one part of the country, you must pay to recycle a Christmas tree and in others it is completely free.  We need to have that just transition principle of equality for everybody to be able to access the services when they want to do the right thing on waste management.<\/p> <p>It is similar around the issue of food loss and waste.  We have concerns with the Bill.  We have amendments, which we will withdraw today and reintroduce on Report Stage, around the definitions of food loss and food waste.  The Food Loss &amp;amp; Waste Protocol is a multi-stakeholder partnership, which has developed the global food loss and waste accounting and reporting standard.  Its steering committee is made up of the Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, and the World Resources Institute, among others.  One of the things we seek to do is ensure there is a proper hierarchy around food waste in order that human food donation is prioritised over using human food for animal feed, for example, or reprocessing into non-food products.  If there is food that is suitable for human consumption then its use for that should be prioritised.  Again, looking at our European counterparts, there are bans in other European countries on the disposal of food fit for human consumption and supermarkets are not allowed do that.  As I said, if we do not get to those amendments we will reintroduce them on Report Stage because they are key issues.  It is also about the definition of food loss rather than food waste.  I would like the Minister of State to address whether or not he will consider that element.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#G00500","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan for indicating she will not be pushing an amendment later on.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State may respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#G00600","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Action Chairperson and thank Senator Ruane for these amendments.  I do not intend to accept Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 or Nos. 15 to 23, inclusive.<\/p> <p>Section 8(9) of the Bill is a broadly-drafted provision that provides for how money from the circular economy fund may be used.  The section is similar to the corresponding section in respect of the environment fund and it provides for a range of purposes relating to the protection of the environment and the transition to a circular economy.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 21, inclusive, provide for additional purposes for which these funds may be used.  I have read through them and the section as drafted is appropriate for the purposes for which it is intended.  The section provides the funds may be used for all purposes in respect of the protection of the environment.  This includes the majority of what is being provided for under these amendments and as a result I will not be accepting them.<\/p> <p>As amendments Nos. 5 and 6 provide for definitions used in amendments Nos. 16 to 21, inclusive, I am not going to accept those amendments.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 22 narrows the scope of section 8(9)(n) by deleting the words \"or other persons\".  Under the Interpretation Act, \"person\" is defined as meaning a body corporate and an unincorporated body of persons, as well as an individual.  It is important that where appropriate initiatives are undertaken in respect of the protection of the environment or sustainable development, funding is available to all organisations or persons that are in a position to undertake appropriate initiatives and therefore I will not be accepting this amendment.<\/p> <p>I also do not accept amendment No. 15.  There is no intention that accounts will be held in financial institutions outside the State and I do not believe this amendment is necessary.  The amendment as drafted is also ambiguous as to financial institutions operating within the State and in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 17, it is not appropriate to limit funding to public research and development only, which would be the effect of this amendment.  All payments from the circular economy fund will be carefully monitored to ensure the value of all research and development funded from the fund.  Some very valuable research and development projects are carried out by the private sector with public funding and to narrow the scope of this provision would be inappropriate.  I do not accept this amendment.<\/p> <p>I am also not accepting amendment No. 23, as it is likely that such a committee will be comprised of members of either my Department or other public service bodies such as the EPA and as a result, the relevant public service codes of conduct will apply.  That should have the same effect as this amendment.<\/p> <p>In general, the circular economy fund replaces the environment fund.  It can be used very broadly for anything that advances the case of our transition towards a circular economy and that can be done through grants, research or funding for businesses to switch towards the circular economy.  Although a small business is a private institution that does not mean it should not receive some kind of funding to help it make a change where that is appropriate.  That is the basic model of what is happening there.  We have the existing example of the environment fund, which the circular economy fund will replace, which has been in operation for 20 years and with which we have much experience.  This is a change from a general environment fund to a circular economy fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#G00700","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment, reserving the right to resubmission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#H00100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656577800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo; &ldquo;just transition&rdquo; means a transition that ensures the economic, environmental and social consequences of the ecological transformation of economies and societies are managed in ways that maximise opportunities of decent work for all, reduce inequalities, promote social justice, and support industries, workers and communities negatively affected, in accordance with nationally defined priorities, and based on effective social dialogue;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#H00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656577800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656577800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656577800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Section 6 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656577800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, and 69 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#H00800","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656577800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 8:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 8 is a small drafting amendment relating to the drafting of a poverty impact assessment under section 7.

I know that a review of the civic amenity sites was carried out and that there were a number of findings from that review, particularly on the tariffs, the opening hours, the different materials that are accepted and the postcode lottery with regard to being within a reasonable distance of a civic amenity site.  Amendment No. 13 seeks to achieve greater harmonisation in respect of those issues while looking at the co-location of facilities with co-operative and social enterprises, including men's sheds.  Again, it is a lottery as to how these facilities are run.  Some civic amenity sites in the country do fantastic work.  I know of one example, a social enterprise operated by someone who takes the dials and buttons off electrical equipment and puts them online in order that if you happen to have an oven, a fridge or whatever else that is no longer manufactured, you can get the replacement handles or dials.  That is a one-off, however.  What we want to see is this harmonisation such that, no matter where you live in the country, your civic amenity site will have similar tariffs and similar opening hours and will accept the same materials as the civic amenity site in the county next door.  We also want to see that sharing, that public co-operation, whereby these wonderful social enterprises operate in conjunction with the civic amenities such that we can learn from those and replicate them around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#H02000","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 9 seeks to include transport, including aviation and shipping, in the sectors listed as sectors which shall be included in the circular economy strategy.  According to the SEAI, transport is by far the largest source of energy-related CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions in Ireland.  Before the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2019, it was responsible for over 40% of energy-related CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.  The Minister of State will be aware that transport is a sector which has emissions reduction targets.  Unfortunately, the carbon budget excluded emissions resulting from aviation and shipping.  We also know that the State has been a bad actor in respect of transport emissions, namely from the subsidisation of fossil fuels used in the sector.  The Government provided &euro;2.4 billion in fossil fuel subsidies in 2019.  The largest subsidy is the excise duty exemption for jet kerosene used for domestic and international commercial aviation.  The revenue forgone from this measure in 2019 was &euro;634 million.  Again, this legislation needs to be broader and needs to take full account of economic activity as it happens within our planetary boundaries.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 seeks the deletion of section 7(6) and its replacement with a stronger provision for green public procurement.  As the Minister of State will no doubt be aware, my colleague, Senator Higgins, has a passion for public procurement and has introduced her own legislation on the issue.  In its pre-legislative scrutiny report on this Bill, the climate committee recommended, in recommendation No. 13, that explicit authority be taken in the Bill for evolving and promoting the uptake of sound principles in respect of design, procurement, packaging, logistics, retail, repairability, etc.  Its recommendation No. 58 was that green public procurement be placed on a statutory footing and that specific provisions reflecting the importance of green public procurement and circular public procurement be included in this Bill and other related legislation.  This is an area of great importance, given that we spent &euro;12 billion on public contracts for goods, services and works in 2019.  I believe that the OGP and the EPA have published guidelines on green public procurement, but those need to put on a statutory basis.  We need to place quality and, in the context of the circular economy, environmental quality criteria at the heart of the public procurement process.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 11 relates to the right to repair.  This amendment would insert the words &quot;and availability&quot; into the provision that targets within the circular economy strategy should result in increased levels of repair and reuse of products and materials.  This is a relatively simple amendment and relates to the issue of just transition.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 12 proposes to insert a requirement that the circular economy strategy set out actions necessary to further just transition and climate justice in the context of the development of a circular economy.  We have discussed the broader issues already but, specifically, this would require the strategy to take account of two of the most important principles when it comes to climate action.  I have discussed the need for an equitable transition which addresses poverty instead of compounding it.  It is based on a social dialogue and the need to ensure all our policies reflect our common but differentiating responsibilities in line with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 69 touches on a different but related issue, fast fashion.  We know that, for so many people, clothing which is not produced sustainably is their only option because it is inexpensive.  We also know, however, that the industry itself is a big polluter and, in the context of climate justice, has a hugely negative impact on indigenous fashion industries in countries in the global south.  Recently, award-winning journalist Sally Hayden reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn Ghana, second-hand garments that arrive from Europe and North America are known as &quot;obroni wawu&quot; &ndash; or &quot;dead white man's clothes&quot;.  Each week around 15 million of them find their way to Accra, the West African country's capital.  About 40 per cent of what arrives is clearly waste, according to local activists, who say the African continent is being left to deal with the devastating effects of the West's overconsumption and the rise in fast fashion. <\/blockquote> <p>I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment as it tries to refocus our work on the circular economy to the global dimension and would look to an industry that is a big polluter and whose practices go against the very idea of a circular economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#H02100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I am not accepting amendments Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive.  The civic amenity sites are the major interface for dealing with recycling and for the general public getting rid of waste and they are often not consistent from one place to another.  Different waste streams are accepted and it is not always entirely clear why.  It is confusing.  I agree with Senator Boylan that men's sheds are part of the circular economy and are often overlooked.  I notice that a lot of voluntary organisations make deals with civic amenity sites to collect various waste streams, whether bits of furniture, bicycles or whatever else.  I would like to see more consistency in the civic amenity sites.  There is a national waste management plan currently being developed across all the local authorities.

There will be consistency on this in future.  The regional waste management planning offices recently published a national review of civic amenity sites.  Discussions have commenced with the local authority sector on the implementation of the report recommendations that will allow civic amenity sites to play a greater role in our transition to a circular economy.  It will also assist in continuing to reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills.  On that basis, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 13.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 9 relates to activities that are inherently international.  This is the amendment on shipping and aviation.  It is very important that shipping and aviation are treated in the same way as other sectors and do not get a free ride.  Otherwise people who are paying charges on their fossil fuels will have to watch airplanes and ships go past that are getting a free ride.  That would not be fair.  On the basis of equity this has to change.  It has to change at international level rather than national level.  The Bill is not the right vehicle for it.  I assure the Senators that when Irish Ministers are in EU Council meetings discussing this with their corresponding Ministers they are making progress on it.  In Luxembourg earlier this week, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made progress on including aviation in the emissions trading scheme and making sure it has to pay for the CO2 emitted, and on moving towards alternative fuels for aircraft.  Shipping and aviation have to be taxed in the same way as any other sectors that use fossil fuels.  They cannot get a free ride.  I agree with the sentiment in this regard.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 10, there is already text in the Bill that relates to public procurement.  It is sufficient and I say this from the point of view of somebody who considers green public procurement very carefully.

The report would also look at the introduction of minimum design standards allowing for the easy disassembly and replacement of key components, and a scoring system on repairability as part of the existing energy label for all energy-consuming products.

This goes to the awful stories we have seen of large companies such as Amazon dumping brand-new televisions purely because they had not been sold.

However, I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 14 and 74, which deal with different aspects of how we use and dispose of consumer goods.  Significantly enhanced repairability and ease of maintenance of consumer goods is an essential component of the circular economy.  The whole-of-government circular economy strategy recognises this and commits to the development of a circular economy for consumer goods with an enhanced focus on the repair sector in Ireland.  Meaningful changes to requirements on, for example, product design, guarantees, consumer information and labelling can be most effectively implemented by way of comprehensive EU legislation rather than through national measures, which can be piecemeal.  This is particularly true for those member states which represent relatively small markets, such as Ireland.<\/p> <p>The European Commission recently announced comprehensive measures in the form of a proposal for a regulation on ecodesign for sustainable products and a proposal for a directive to empower consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and better information.  The proposed ecodesign regulation will address product design and set new requirements to make products more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain, refurbish and recycle and more energy and resource efficient.  The proposed directive on consumer information will support improved participation of consumers in the circular economy through the provision of information on the durability and reparability of products and by enhancing consumer protection against unfair commercial practices that prevent sustainable purchases.  These include greenwashing, built-in obsolescence and the use of unreliable and non-transparent sustainability labels and information tools.<\/p> <p>The EU is working on this.  What the public will see are labels on consumer goods that are similar to the type of labelling that indicates energy efficiency.  Products will have a clear colour-coded A, B, C, D, E or F rating to indicate the durability of the product, how long it will last if bought and how easy it will be to repair it.  People will be able to tell they are buying a product that will give them five, ten or 15 years service and they can make an informed consumer decision.  To do this we need a testing mechanism from an independent body that provides reliable results on the lifespan of a product and how repairable it is.  This will be backed up by European rules to force manufacturers to provide spare parts and manuals so that we get away from built-in obsolescence.  Built-in obsolescence is not a myth.  It is a real design philosophy for some companies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am sure of that from speaking to the people who work in the repair sector.  They have told me that even some high-end products are designed in such a way that after a certain period people need to buy another product.  Moving towards more durable products is a return to the way that products were designed in the past.  That is a welcome addition and is happening at an EU level.  One of the people who is working on that is Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, MEP, whom I will meet soon and he is deeply involved in the right to repair.  I believe we can really achieve something at an EU level that we cannot do at a local level.  However, at a local level we can help anyone who is involved in the repair sector through grants or funding from the circular economy fund, when it is set up.  That could be entities like men's sheds, repair caf&eacute;s or repair shops.  The right to repair is extremely important and I think that it will have a lot of public support.

In France, there is legislation where retailers are obliged to look for other options for unsold products, including donation or recycling.  It is senseless for perfectly good products to end up being wasted in landfill or being incinerated.  Also, if products are going straight from the shelf to landfill without even being used once then there is extra embodied carbon, and there is all of the waste of energy and raw materials that went into making these products.

We have already extensively discussed the issue of the reflection of these two principles in the legislation more broadly.  This amendment seeks to say in law that the circular economy programme must reflect the principles of just transition and climate justice.  It is not an overly-prescriptive requirement.  It is one which would strengthen the legislation both in terms of facilitating an equitable transition and creating a requirement that our circular economy policies align with our international obligations in respect of climate justice both within the\u00a0United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 28 is a relatively simple amendment.  It seeks to change the timeframe in which the agency must review the circular economy strategy from at least once every six years after the publication of the first strategy to once every three years.  Once every six years is too long a timeframe.  We should seek to identify problems or issues with the operation of the programme as quickly as possible.  We need to be able to do so quickly because we are in a climate emergency and are running out of time.<\/p> <p>In April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its Sixth Assessment Report, from working group III.  The press release for the interim report stated, \"In the scenarios we assessed, limiting warming to around 1.5&deg;C (2.7&deg;F) requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43% by 2030\".  As 2025 is just two and half years away, we cannot wait for six years to meaningfully review these provisions.  On that basis, I do not believe that even our own amendment goes far enough and I may seek to reduce the period even further to two years on Report Stage.  I urge the Minister of State to reflect on this matter and table amendments to reduce the timescale.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 29 is a simple amendment that seeks to include the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action as one of the organisations to which the agency will give a copy of the circular economy programme, once it is published.  As this is the relative sectoral committee for this legislation, it is important that the committee be kept informed.

This amendment seeks to give the Minister the power to ban the supply of electronic items with absolute obsolescence built in.  I will speak to amendment No. 48 as well, as that amendment seeks to give the Minister the power to ban the supply of electronic items with relative obsolescence built in.  For context, &ldquo;obsolescence&rdquo; is the question of how and when a product reaches the end of its useful lifetime and is replaced with a new one. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 53 seeks to add a definition to clarify my amendments.  According to the European Environmental Agency, EEA, &ldquo;absolute obsolescence&rdquo; happens when a product no longer functions for objective reasons because of mechanical failure or incompatibility of software.  &ldquo;Relative obsolescence&rdquo; means that the product is still functional but is considered obsolete because of a desire for a new item - if this desire is for psychological, style, cosmetic reasons, it is aesthetic obsolescence; if a new product has better quality, functionality or effectiveness, it is technological obsolescence; and if the price of the repair or upgrade is too high compared with a new product, it is economic obsolescence.<\/p><p>According to a paper by the European Parliamentary Research Service, for some products, such as washing machines, the main the driver for purchases of new items is absolute obsolescence.  For mobile phones or televisions, relative obsolescence is more important.  According to the EEA, a product becomes prematurely obsolescent when it breaks down early compared to what is a possible, which is the designed lifetime, or compared with what is desirable, which is the desired lifetime.  This is often built in to electronic devices and these two forms are known together as &ldquo;planned obsolescence&rdquo;.  In its pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation, the climate committee recommended that an examination be conducted into potential measures to address the challenge of planned obsolescence, particularly in relation to electronics.  This should include a broad examination of international examples and potential measures could include a right to repair.  The committee pointed out that both France and Italy have legislated to ban planned obsolescence, and although they have challenges, it is an issue that needs strong regulatory action.<\/p><p>I will come now to amendment No. 47, which is closely related to the issue of obsolescence in electronics.  Amendment No. 47 seeks to add products that require precious or rare earth minerals to complete the list of items which the Minister may by regulation prohibit the supply of in the State.  In its pre-legislative scrutiny report, the committee recommended that there should be specific measures for tracking, reuse and repair of products that are built with critical materials such as precious minerals.  It also recommended that given the importance of the management of minerals, including precious minerals, in the context of national and global circular economy strategies, regulation and, where necessary, limitations in respect of the extraction of such minerals should be considered. <\/p><p>I have spoken previously about extraction in the context of climate justice, but in the context of this amendment, it is worth noting that at least $10 billion worth of gold, platinum and other precious metals are dumped every year into the growing mountain of electronic waste polluting our environment, according to the United Nations Global e-Waste Monitor 2020 report.  A record 54 million tonnes of e-waste was generated worldwide in 2019.  For context, this is equivalent to 7.3 kg for every person on this planet, but obviously much of this waste is generated in the global north.  The report cites the lack of regulation and the short lifespan of products that are hard or impossible to repair as reasons for this much waste. <\/p><p>This set of amendments would allow us to seriously begin to reduce the damage being done by the extraction of precious metals and minerals which are deeply linked to climate justice and to try to curb the neocolonial aspects of production of electronic goods and the extraction and exploitation required to produce those products.  I urge the Minister to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#L03500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 49 and 50.

It was raised with us under pre-legislative scrutiny.  In fact, a report that was lodged with the committee found that items which are used for takeaway materials in the Oireachtas have much higher levels of PFAS lining in them than what is considered safe.  However, this is not just about the health implications for people who are eating items out of products that have PFAS linings; it is also about the manufacture of them.

If a ban is applied to a single-use item by the Minister on the basis that a suitable reusable alternative is readily available, this amendment will ensure the reusable alternative is both recyclable and readily available.  It will alleviate the risk that plastic reusable alternatives which are not recyclable are considered by the Minister as the readily available alternative.

It goes back to this concern that others and I have about the unintended consequences of what we are trying to do here.  I have been shown cheap alternatives to the paper cup that are marginally more expensive.  I have spoken to people in the hospitality trade who sell coffee and are of the view that there will be plenty of people who still will not have a long-term keep cup.  There is no doubt that the industry will fill that void with a cheap alternative that has the capacity to be discarded after a single use.  The impact of the life cycle of a product will mean that a piece of chunky plastic, even if it is recyclable, is draining resources to provide for a demand in the marketplace.

I accept what Senator Boylan stated in respect of there being a film of plastic, albeit a very small one.  Let us work to find a system or product that breaks down.  While that is not ideal, the reality is that replacing it with a chunk of plastic would be a cheap alternative.  My experience is that people attending an event get a bag from various companies with a plastic keep cup or whatever.   Some of them are very poor quality.

In this regard, it is important that they are comprehensively regulated at EU level rather than through the national legislation of individual member states.<\/p> <p>In recent years, the EU has set in place several new strategies aimed at strengthening chemical legislation to ensure that chemicals are safe and sustainable by design and that the most hazardous chemicals are banned.  My Department, along with other Departments and agencies that have responsibility for chemicals policy, is actively engaging with the EU on this matter and strongly supports the initiatives being undertaken at EU level.  These include the farm to fork strategy, the chemicals strategy for sustainability and the European Commission review of the packaging and packaging waste directive.  The effective regulation of PFAS is appropriately being addressed at EU level and Ireland is actively engaging with our EU colleagues on a number of initiatives in this regard.

I touched on this earlier.  Some of them relate to the definition of food waste as compared with food loss.  Many people are familiar with food waste and that one third of food purchased goes into the bin without being consumed.  That is just the food that makes it to the shop or retail outlet.Food loss relates to food that might not even make it as far as the shop.  It may relate to a farmer deciding it is more economical to leave a crop in the field than harvesting it, or to a product that is damaged in transport.  It is important that we capture the full definition of food waste which incorporates that idea of food loss.<\/p><p>As I stated earlier, amendment No. 63 relates to the hierarchy of food waste and encouraging food donation and redistribution for human consumption being prioritised over using human food for animal feed or for reprocessing into biofuels or non-food products.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 65 calls for an annual review to evaluate the outcomes against the stated deliverables of the national food loss and waste prevention strategy, based on data collected from all food sectors and the waste industry, and to provide recommendations on the adjustment of the national food loss and waste prevention strategy or other measures, including financial measures, to address any barriers or shortfalls as may be identified by the review.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 68 relates to the definition of food waste.  We need to distinguish between food loss and food waste.  That would be in line with the international protocol and have the added benefit of allowing us to have greater comparison between countries across the world.<\/p><p>As regards amendment No. 72, I touched on this earlier.  It relates to a supermarket refill station report.  It asks for the Minister to prepare and publish a report examining how retailers can reduce the amount of plastic packaging in Ireland &quot;by encouraging customers to use reusable containers through s through greater requiring a minimum amount of floor space be dedicated to refill stations&quot;.  As I stated, this measure is in place in other EU member states.  Large supermarkets over 400 sq. m are obliged to have a percentage of that floor space dedicated to refillable or reusable items.  We know that dried food goods and detergents are wide open to being used in this way.  They can be sold in refillable containers.  The requirement in France is that all supermarkets larger than 400 sq. m allocate 20% of floor space to reusable or refillable products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#M02300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 46 seeks to add types of items that the Minister may, by regulation, prohibit the supply of in the State.

It came to my attention before I came into the Chamber that today is International Day of Parliamentarism.  I wish Members a happy international day.  It is important to recognise that we live in a country where democracy prevails.  It is important also to appreciate and respect that.<\/p> <p>One of the issues I wish to raise today is in regard to the disability capacity review.  This was published a year ago and detailed the current outstanding, and indeed unmet, needs of HSE funded disability services up to 2032.  It is basically a ten-year programme which highlights significant levels of unmet need.  This is particularly significant for individuals with complex needs and for their family carers.  The action plan to address those unmet needs was due to be published by last December.  However, there is still no sign of it.  We have to be particularly conscious of this as negotiations are well under way for budget 2023.  I call for immediate publication of the action plan to ensure it is contained within the budgetary plan for 2023.  That is essential so that another year does not pass with individuals and families left in limbo.<\/p> <p>I also wish to refer to the fact the Defence Forces will be called up to work in Dublin Airport.  There are not too many professions in which people are not sure where they will be called to day to day.  The Army is one of those groups of people who are called in as a matter of last resort.  They do that in the service of their country.  It is important the training they are currently undergoing is certified appropriately because when anybody undertakes training for something, it is important to get that recognition.  More important, I understand Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, will pay the Department of Defence for using the Army but there would be a discrepancy between that and what it would pay its staff.  It is important those who serve in that capacity would get that differential and receive the same rate of pay per hour as those who work for the DAA.<\/p> <p>It was announced this week that bus route 129 in County Kildare, between Kilcullen and Naas, passing through parts of the Curragh and Athgarvan, will cease operating tomorrow.  A private bus operator operates this route with the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  I appreciate fuel prices have gone up and that there can be difficulties with drivers but to suddenly pull out of an important service is unacceptable.  Connectivity is hugely important.  The route is used by school students, elderly people and care providers because it enables them to go between day services in Kilcullen and Newbridge.  I have no doubt this route is not alone in the country in being pulled in this way.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, must meet with the operators and try to negotiate even a more limited service.  It is frustrating that we cannot table Commencement matters about the NTA.  We should be able to raise that with the Minister for Transport.  I call on the Leader to write to the NTA to see what can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#Q00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Today is International Day of Parliamentarism.

I am still getting calls from people working in hospitals who are and were on the front line right through the pandemic but who still have not got their payments.  The good is nearly gone out of it at this stage in view of the fact that they have been waiting so long.  Why in the name of God is it taking so long to pay people the &euro;1,000 they were promised last January?  If the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is coming in here before the end of term, which I doubt because we have not seen much of him lately, he should be asked to explain why it is taking so long to pay the pandemic bonus payment.  Truly, everyone should have a date that they know they will have it by.  No matter what happens, such a date should be identified.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator O'Loughlin regarding the NTA.  We need a debate on transport.  Transport is critical for hundreds of thousands of citizens in terms of commuting, especially with the cost of fuel.

We have a situation in my constituency where it is 30% dearer to make a journey from Ennis to Limerick or from Ennis to Galway on the train compared with what it costs to travel a similar distance from Maynooth to Dublin.  It is 30% to 40% cheaper to go from Maynooth to Dublin by train than it is to go from Ennis to Limerick or Ennis to Galway.

It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tToday is Thalidomide Memorial Day and if you can at 2pm today pause and think of all those people and their families who have been, and continue to be affected by the Thalidomide tragedy:<br \/><br \/>The memory of the children who did not survive to enjoy a full and rewarding life;<br \/><br \/>The memory of parents and loved ones who gave so much in the care of their children;<br \/><br \/>All who worked so tirelessly in helping and supporting those who sought justice from this episode in history;<br \/><br \/>We also remember those members of our Thalidomide family who still await recognition of their circumstances. <\/blockquote> <p>The letter is signed by Ms Finola Cassidy, spokesperson for the Irish Thalidomide Association, ITA.  It would be important, if we had time today, amongst ourselves at any time or at 2 p.m., to pause for a moment.  Their cause is not complete.  Their campaign is not over and they need support.  More than ever, they need our support.  I hope that we will use our influence and our political parties and groupings to highlight their continuing campaign.<\/p><p>On scoliosis, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, approved a plan in February.  He told us of great ambitions and stated that he would reduce the number of scoliosis patients waiting more than four months from 94 at the end of January to zero by the end of the year - we are nearly halfway through the year -  increase scoliosis spinal surgeries by 92 in 2022, reduce the overall scoliosis waiting list from 224 at end January to 128 by the end of year and have additional 107 spina bifida cases treated.  Given the time, perhaps the Leader would use her good offices to write to the Minister rather than have the Minister back in here, if he has difficulty coming to the House.  These are busy times for all Ministers.  I respectfully ask that the Leader write to the Minister on our behalf in order to get an update on these key figures and where matters stand halfway through the year.  It is better that we know now how we are doing on these targets in order that they can be met in the second part of the year.<\/p><p>In the context of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022, the Leader has been clear about her position in relation to taking all Stages of a Bill at once.  We are coming to the end of the term.  It might be helpful for the Leader to explain in response to the Order of Business the rationale for this proposal.  There is a rationale in this case but it is something that we should not make a habit of.  In fairness, during Senator Doherty's watch as Leader, it is not something we have had to deal with.  We need to give scrutiny to all legislation, including the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022.  In this case, there is a proposal on the Order of Business today.  The Leader might explain to the House the rationale for that proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#R00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will begin by highlighting that as we end the month of June, a month of summertime, we have a new record number of patients on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  The new record is 1,829.  If we are creating new records of patients on trolleys in June, God help us when it comes to September, October and the onset of winter.  I do not doubt that the Leader has requested a debate on the university hospital for me on a number of occasions.  I would ask the Leader to do so again.  It is not acceptable for the Minister not to come in here and talk to us about the crisis that, in fairness, Senators of all stripes have highlighted, certainly, for as long as I have been here.  As for the suffering, I could spend the rest of my three minutes talking about it but I would rather be constructive and ask can we get the Minister in to see what actions he will take right now to try and help alleviate this crisis.  There are solutions but the Minister needs to come and be accountable in relation to this issue.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I had the good fortune to attend the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media briefly.  The committee heard a set of presentations from Dr. Deirdre Curran of NUIG, the respected and recognised academic expert in relation to the hospitality sector, and representatives from SIPTU and Unite the Union.  Some of the statistics were stark.  I recognise that we had a good day in terms of hospitality here in the Seanad yesterday in terms of the Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Bill 2022 - all parties deserve credit for that - but I am not hearing from the Government side of the House recognition that there is a fundamental problem in the hotel sector.  Let me spell it out for the House.  The following figures are from F&aacute;ilte Ireland's report on last year, Tourism Careers: Labour Research.  Some 68% of workers in the hospitality sector are paid less than &euro;12 an hour.  I have to ask the question, how can one expect people to join that sector with a prospects of a real career in it when one is looking at seven out of ten workers earning less than &euro;12 an hour?  We know what the solution is.<\/p> <p>I will give credit to Senator Pat Casey, himself a hotelier, who acknowledged here yesterday that we need a joint labour committee established.  We need to put a floor of decency in place.  We need to put wage progression in place so that when one starts as a barman or porter, one can get wage increases year after year.  We need to have proper training in place.  We need a floor of decency and the problem is the hoteliers refuse to engage with the joint labour committee process.  In the context of the significant support the Government has given to the hospitality sector, it is entirely unreasonable for the hotels to act, effectively using this veto, to not negotiate with trade unions, to not allow a joint labour committee to take place and to not allow decent standards to be returned to the hotels sector.  I am asking for an urgent debate on this topic.  The hotel lobby is powerful, particularly with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, but there are too many people being let down for too long in the hospitality sector.  These figures are the Government's.  They are undeniable.  We need change in the hospitality sector and we need the Government to lead from the front.  I ask for a debate on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#R00800","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>On International Day of Parliamentarism we might consider paying our staff a fair wage.  We would not be here at all without them and I wanted to remind everyone that issue is ongoing and has not been resolved.  It is one that is causing great distress and costing us staff.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise two items.  One of my favourite topics, outside my beloved students, is the repeal review.  I noted that in an exchange this week the Taoiseach said \"fatal foetal abnormality works both ways as well\".  I am not entirely clear what was meant by that.  I know and have spoken to people who have lost a much-loved and much-wanted child to a fatal foetal abnormality.  They must travel to access the reproductive healthcare they should have been able to access here.  I am of the belief, as I think many people are, that we voted to end all travel for reproductive healthcare - I will just say the word - for abortions.  It has been said here before but I say again it is immensely frustrating the so-called repeal review now operating is very different to the one promised by the then Minister for Health in 2018.  I am not sure that we have been given a good explanation as to why it has changed and why it is in a different format to the one that was explicitly clear.  If it was not explicitly clear then a collective of us misunderstood the situation and that includes the people who were in the room when those negotiations and discussions were happening.  It is very frustrating when we still have people travelling and still have leaders of the country talking about both sides to something.  That is not going to solve the issue of people travelling.  That we are so insistent this is just going to be about the operation of the legislation as opposed to the impact it is having is immensely frustrating.  I really wish the Minister for Health could come in here and give an explanation for why this is happening or even an indication of how the review is going in and of itself.  It seems to have died down quietly.  I hope there are lots of things happening in the background.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to speak briefly about is another I have spoken about before, that is, the issue of care.  It is very close to my own heart, not that that is a reason you must have to bring something up.  DEBRA Ireland, which is focused on epidermolysis bullosa, EB, a rare genetic condition, had its briefing this morning.  For those who do not know, the condition makes your skin paper-thin.  It is very fragile and difficult to manage.  DEBRA Ireland has extremely modest requests.  Sometimes you see pre-budget submissions coming in and there are millions upon millions but these are extremely modest.  They include a ring-fenced fund of &euro;786,000 for home nursing care for children and adults with severe EB, funding of &euro;70,000 for an outreach nurse and mental health supports for children at a cost of &euro;80,000.  The group's main issue is the provision of staffing.  We have talked about this here before.  Charities are filling the gap where the Government is not doing it.  I wanted to put that on record.  These are extremely reasonable requests to support people who are very severely affected.  I will be writing to the Minister for Health on this.<\/p> <p>As I must leave, Senators might forgive me for scooting out before hearing the response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#S00100","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#S00200","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#S00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Families have faced devastation at Lough Funshinagh with their homes, farms and roads.

There are generations of farming families living in Ardmullan, Lisfelim, Ballagh and Rahara, and I have extended family living in the area too.  They suffer great mental anguish and exhaustion from watching rising waters, especially coming into wintertime, and knowing that the roads cannot be raised any more.  These people know they potentially will not be able to get into their homes or that they could be in their home and be stranded.<\/p> <p>Over the past year I have met the committees and local councillors who have showed me the devastation in the area, especially after the last few winters.  We had an urgent engineering solution in the form of a 3 km overflow pipe and a &euro;1.7 million investment agreed by the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, to support Roscommon County Council.  However, this was halted in the courts.  I represent this region, which is suffering from the impacts of climate change, rising river levels and flooding events.

However, the floods have destroyed the feeding grounds for birds and wildlife and flora and fauna generally.  In Ireland we have SACs in poor condition.  How do we balance the restoration of our SACs and the livelihoods of communities?  Farmers, through the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the new agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, are leading on agri-environmental schemes.  They are working to be custodians of our environment.  However, right now homes and livelihoods are under threat in County Roscommon.  Next it could be the city centre of Limerick, Cork or Dublin, and what happens when it is 100 homes that are under threat close to an SAC?

The fact the European Union has stood so strongly together in introducing a range of sanctions is something to be welcomed.  However, it is a matter of concern there a significant number of companies continue to do business in Russia and indeed with Putin's regime.  The Yale School of Management has conducted an extensive examination of the companies that are interacting with Russia.  It is fortunate that any of them based in Ireland have all been found to have withdrawn, so there are no Irish-based companies continuing to interact with the regime.  However, it has determined there are 244 global companies where it is effectively business as usual with Russia.  Some of these are based in our fellow EU member states but others are very well-known brands.  These include Asics, Benetton, Clarins, Diesel, Giorgio Armani, Etihad Airways, Hard Rock Cafe, Lacoste, Patreon, Phillips, Qatar Airways, TGI Fridays, and Turkish Airlines.  I wish to especially highlight Emirates, as it is a company that operates a lot out of Ireland.  It is very clear the United Arab Emirates, UAE, is becoming a safe haven for both Russian money and for wealthy Russian oligarchs who want to escape the sanctions that have been applied against Russia.  It is notable, for instance, that the share of Russian buyers of real estate in Dubai in quarter 1 has gone up by 67% based on purchasing rates.<\/p> <p>First, I would like us to call on those companies to take action.  Second, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to call in the ambassador of the UAE and that clarity is provided around what action it is taking against Putin's unjust war against Ukraine and also that, as the Emirates airline is owned by the UAE, that action be taken to stop co-operation between the airline and the Russian regime.

Tomorrow is 1 July, when Irish hospitals traditionally change their doctors.  It happens because hospitals are massive training locations.  You do a year as an intern and when that year is done you move to the next level of training, and so on.  Tomorrow, for the first time in the history of Irish medicine, the hospital system finds itself short of first-year registrars.  These are effectively the hospital consultants of the future.  Why has this happened?  I am told it is due to Covid.  Covid stopped the travel, so they are only moving out now and no doctors want to work in the Irish system.  The cost is too high versus the return.  Does the Leader think the Minster for Health is aware of this and its far-reaching social and economic consequences?<\/p> <p>The second issue is our national planning framework, published in 2018, prior to the most recent census and the Ukrainian war.  The figures arising out of both of these warrant a re-examination of the framework as a matter of urgency.  To take just one county, the Leader's and my county, as an example, Meath's development plan was based on a predicted population in 2026 of 216,221, rising in 2030 to 223,531.  However, preliminary census figures show the population on 3 April was recorded at 220,295, which is an increase of 12% since 2016.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The growth of the population of County Meath is far outstripping what was anticipated under the national planning framework and the county development plan.  It is not alone in that regard when it comes to other counties, least of all Dublin, our neighbouring county, which is at the epicentre of a housing crisis.  Taking all of this into account, and in light of his recent clarification that the Government will not acknowledge any logistical-limiting factors regarding the taking in of refugees, the Minister must come before the House and explain to the people of Ireland how it will work.  He should immediately suspend the national planning framework and call upon the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to review it in light of last week's CSO figures.  The current development plans for Meath and many other counties are now dead in the water based on the figures.  A failure to appreciate and act upon this will lead to more drawn-out difficulties and hardship down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#S00600","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I again call on the Minister for Finance to commit to the introduction of a vacant property tax, which would discourage vacancy and encourage the renovation of vacant properties.

This morning, many of us from Cork received correspondence from the Cope Foundation, an organisation which supports 2,800 people with intellectual disabilities, as well as families, and which employs more than 1,200 people in Cork.  The foundation is asking for the pace of planning for the implementation of disability capacity review to 2032 to be increased.  It is looking for its inclusion in the budgeting process of 2023 and an accessible budget announcement for disability, which is a very fair request.  I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is invited to the House to outline her Department's plan for the disability capacity review to 2032 and that there would be widespread engagement by the HSE.  There is a fundamental problem with the HSE in terms of its work regarding disability.  To be fair, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, is a very good Minister, but we need the HSE to engage with organisations and families in order that a continuum of care can be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#T00500","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Decisions are made by Departments, particularly in regard to pensions.  I know my colleague, Senator O'Loughlin, is deeply concerned about what I am going speak about now.  The military service allowance is pensionable today but, at some stage, a decision was made that it would not be pensionable for those who were the early recipients of the allowance.  Some sort of a deal was struck.  The Defence Forces is not the first State organisation within which something like this has happened.  In the case of the Garda, a number of officers who retired many years ago were not allowed to carry their pensions forward.<\/p> <p>There is also the issue of pension abatement that was originally designed to stop high-paid civil servants retiring during the financial crisis with massive pensions and lump sums and going straight back to the Departments in which they worked or to other Departments and receiving serious salaries.  If a private soldier, a corporal or a sergeant who retires from the Defence Forces after 40 years gets a job in the public service, the chances are that he or she will lose his or her pension.<\/p> <p>There were two court cases in the State that went as far as the Supreme Court, wherein a pension was declared to be a property right and could not be touched.  One involved a prisoner in Mountjoy who had a contributory old age pension.  The State argued that the person was a prisoner and would have no pension.  He said that he had contributed to the pension and that it was his.  He took the case to the Supreme Court, which ruled that his pension was his.  The second case involved a former Cabinet Minister who went to jail.  An attempt was made to take his pension and he successfully fought the matter through the courts, wherein it was deemed that a pension is a property right.<\/p> <p>I contend, and I think Senator O'Loughlin will agree, that pension abatement is illegal.  It is theft of a property right.  Pensioners from the Defence Forces and the Garda are most affected by this because they are forced to retire at 50 years of age, in most cases.  If they come back into the public service, the Departments do not want to pay them a benefit for getting a second job.  If Departments say that they cannot come back and have a full salary, that is fine, but they should not touch a pension.  A pension is a property right.  All the Members of the House will depend on their pensions when they reach a particular age.  It is simply wrong.  Let us be honest about it.  For a private soldier, a corporal or a sergeant, and right up to the rank of colonel, the pension is not that fantastic.  They talk about the golden pensions public servants have.  Those are a long time gone.  They were hammered in 1996, 2011 and 2013.  The way things are going now, young men join the Defence Forces as commissioned officers, get a trip or two overseas and leave.  We have to stop the theft of pensions and we have to return the military service allowance to those who had it.  It should be part of their pension.

I do not have a response as to how and why that happened but I will make inquiries and see if I can do anything to offer some assistance and information to the Senator.  He is absolutely right in regard to the second point he made on pension abatement.  We cannot have one set of rules for one part of our civil and public service and a different set of rules for another.  I can say that standing here having learned my lesson as a former Minister when I was indeed taken to court and was myself rudely awakened, but correctly so.  <\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer, along with the opening comments of Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin, talked about the disability capacity review that was conducted by the HSE and the Department of Health a number of years ago.  It is a ten-year strategy that outlines on three levels exactly what is required to service the people in this country and the providers with the State supports that are needed.  I only read this a couple of weeks ago because I had the privilege of meeting some senior officials in Prosper Fingal.<\/p> <p>When we look at what is required, it is done in three columns.  It is done so that in one column it shows that we absolutely need a certain amount to stand still, we need another certain amount if we are going to be ambitious, and if we include all the people who probably are not included in our statistics we need yet another amount.<\/p> <p>To put that in context and to support both Senators looking for that capacity review and the plan to be published, 180 inpatient full-time respite beds were required in order to stand still for the year 2022.  If we were to look after all the people that would actually need them this year we would have needed finance for 360 beds.  In this year&rsquo;s budget we got 60, so we got one third of what was needed to actually just stand still, and a fraction of what we need to cater for everybody&rsquo;s real requirements.  Therefore, I support the two Members in looking for that framework to be published immediately but also just to highlight the matter - not to be disrespectful to the disability services with the HSE because they can only do what they can with the money they are given.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin is right in that the money that is needed must be put in the budget right now.  It is not a case that we can continuously blame our community-based HSE providers or our section 38s or 39s because in fairness they provide a wonderful service to those people for whom they can provide it.  However, they can only provide it on the basis of the money they are actually given and not some report that says they should be, when in actual fact they are not.  I join with the Senators in looking for that published plan long before we get into the budget negotiations in September.

I certainly will do that.  <\/p> <p>Senator Keogan highlighted another serious anomaly with regard to the CSO figures.  Again I concur with her.  This is not unique to Dublin or Meath.  I am sure it is infringed in every other county council area in the country with regard to developments and planning for our towns and villages which we want to do in a sustainable and supported way.  If we do not even know who we are supposed to be developing our towns and villages for and the correct populations, we are hampering and starting off on the back foot.  Senator Keogan is right, the national planning framework needs to be re-evaluated, in particular for all those county councils that are still mid-national development plans and local development area plans.  I certainly support that call today.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about the 242 international companies that continue to do business as usual in Russia, as if there were no terrorist attacks or atrocities being inflicted on other human beings.  I certainly concur with him in that regard.  I will write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, today and make the request sought by the Senator with regard to the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates.  I will revert to him on that.<\/p><p>Senators Hoey and Buttimer called for the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas to be paid a fair wage.  I know all Members of this House support that.  The matter is currently before the Workplace Relations Commission and the sooner it is adjudicated upon, the better for us all.  What we want to see is the quality we have in all our offices recompensed by a decent wage on which those concerned can afford to live.  Senator Hoey also called for the repeal review to be updated.  I will ask the Minister to update the House on when the final report will be issued to us.  We will organise a debate on it.  The Senator also touched on the issue of DEBRA Ireland, which made its pre-budget submission this morning, seeking the relatively small sum of &euro;786,000 to try to address the issue of the people it supports.  <\/p><p>Senator Gavan sought a debate on University Hospital Limerick.  He has done so on several occasions, as have Senators Conway and Maria Byrne.  There is a standing offer of any time that I can allocate for the Minister.  I will reiterate that today.  The only thing I can say, particularly on behalf of the people in the region, is that I hope the independent review group that has been established will come back very soon with recommendations that will be enacted.  Senator Gavan is also seeking a debate on the hospitality sector and the joint labour committee, JLC.  He is right to point that out, insofar as the State has really supported that industry in recent years, particularly because of Covid, the very least it can do is to come to the table and have a conversation about a career structure development and pay progression plan for the people on whom it relies to work in the industry.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan spoke about thalidomide.  He also sought an update from the Minister on the plans announced earlier this year in respect of scoliosis patients which do not seem to have come to fruition just yet.  The Senator also asked me for an explanation as to why I am proposing to take all Stages of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022 next week.  To explain to colleagues, I did a deal, for want of a better word, with them in recent years that we would not take all Stages of a Bill together unless there was an absolute emergency.  It appears that such an emergency has happened.  There is a problem with the Estimates for the particular organisations dealt with in the Bill.  If we do not get the Bill passed and signed by the Minister and the President by the middle of next week, the Estimates will fall and all those organisations will have no money.  We need to bring in a new schedule of Estimates and that can only be done after the House passes the Bill and it goes to the President.  It is not our fault that it has been left as late as this but I ask for Members&rsquo; co-operation in dealing with the Bill next week.  Obviously, if they do not wish to co-operate, I will  have to come up with a plan B.  I am asking them to consider allowing us to do it, given that it is only a money Bill to give extra money to those organisations to ensure they continue to keep the lights on, in effect.<\/p><p>While I am on my feet discussing this, the agenda for the following week is currently being prepared by my office.  At this time next week, I will probably be asking Members to take all Stages of two other Bills in the final sitting week.  I give them notice of that.  The reason all Stages will be taken together is that the Bills have not even been published yet, so I could not attempt to put them on the agenda for next week, even if I wanted to do so.  One of them will relate to the &euro;100 charge for children&rsquo;s hospitals.  Patients aged under 16 are currently charged &euro;100 when they go to an accident and emergency department or for an overnight stay.  That Bill will come before the House in the week commencing 11 July and I will be asking Senators to take all Stages of the Bill that week.  The Department of Justice is bringing forward a Ukrainian omnibus Bill that apparently requires to be finished before the recess.  It has not yet been published, however, and I cannot schedule it until I get it.  Forewarned is forearmed.  Members can come back to me next week and let me know their views, but I ask for their co-operation in respect of taking all Stages of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill next week.  I hope that answers Senator Boyhan&rsquo;s question.<\/p><p>Senator Conway spoke about the International Day of Parliamentarism and called for a more reflective representation in both Houses.  Obviously, this House is a little better than the D&aacute;il in that regard.  He called for more diversity, with people reflecting the entire population of Ireland, including from ethnicity and disability perspectives.  There is a need to have all walks of life represented.  The debate in the Houses would be far more interesting if we had lots of different representatives of communities.  Senator Conway also joined the call for a debate on transport and the NTA.<\/p><p>Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin opened the Order of Business by referring to the disability capacity review.  She also raised the issue of the Defence Forces being called in to do emergency support work at Dublin Airport and the need to ensure they are paid properly and, at least, to have the decency and respect to have conversations with the people upon whom we consistently rely so often.<\/p><p>She also highlighted the cessation of operation of bus route No. 129 in County Kildare.  She is right that it is not the only bus route that has been ceased this summer without notice.  Handing out leaflets on a bus route to say a bus will not be operating for the next couple of months and the company might get back to its passengers in September, as has happened in Fingal and Kildare, is really not the way to do business.  We should be supporting all public transport, particularly the services with the PSO levy.  I will send a letter to the NTA and the Minister today on her behalf.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#U00600","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The Leader did not deal with an issue I raised.

The growth of interference with elections and the increased number of people who rely on the Internet and social media as their main source of news make this problem an urgent one.  There is a real risk that future electoral processes in Ireland will be interfered with by foreign and domestic entities acting in bad faith and for selfish ends.  Not only does this create an immediate potential for undesirable or extreme political outcomes, but it also serves to undermine the trust and confidence of the Irish electorate in the political process.  Such disengagement poses a long-term threat to civic society.<\/p><p>Against this background and having regard to similar issues that arose during pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, when publishing the Electoral Reform Bill in 2022, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, signalled that he had asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals and options for inclusion in the Bill with a specific focus around the protection of the integrity of our electoral processes that could include a role for the electoral commission in this regard.  <\/p><p>To progress this critical issue, a suite of amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill were recommended by the Attorney General and approved by Government, which would protect the integrity of our electoral processes in the online sphere.  These new provisions, which were published on 10 June last, will place Ireland in much better position to combat the potential threats to the integrity of our elections and referendums.<\/p><p>With this in mind, I am proposing amendments No. 142 to amend the Long Title of the Bill in order to provide for the insertion of a new Part 5 in the Electoral Reform Bill.  In effect, the amendment to the Long Title is proposed so that the Bill can provide for a regulatory framework to protect the integrity of elections and referendums against the dissemination or publication of online disinformation, online misinformation and manipulative or inauthentic behaviour online.  This will allow for the insertion of a new Part 5 in the Bill which will provide for the regulation of the electoral process information online, electoral information and manipulative or inauthentic behaviour to further protect the integrity of elections against online misinformation and online disinformation.  These provisions were published by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, on 10 June last and are also subject to a notification of the European Commission in accordance with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2015\/153, that is, the technical regulations information systems notification procedure.<\/p><p>The insertion of a new Part 5 into the Bill and the additional functions assigned to the electoral commission to protect the integrity of our elections and referendums gives rise to a small number of consequential amendments to Part 2 of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 1, 7, 26, 27 and 68 all relate to the consequential amendments, having regard to the insertion of the new Part 5 into the Bill.<\/p><p>At the outset, there is a need to insert a new section 3 into the Bill to provide that the electoral commission may by way of an order prescribe the timeframe for an election campaign period in relation to any election or referendum.  In effect, this will allow the electoral commission to bring forward the electoral period to a specific time before the making of a polling day order for the purpose of exercising its functions to protect the integrity of elections under Part 5 of the Bill.  <\/p><p>A second consequential amendment relates to section 9(4) of the Bill, which sets out recommendations for the appointment of ordinary members to the electoral commission.  This amendment provides that while making recommendations on the appointment of an ordinary member, expertise in information and communications technology and its use in context of election or referendum campaigns will be a desirable characteristic for an ordinary member to have, given its functions in respect to both online political advertising and on preventing the spread of certain types of disinformation, misinformation and inauthentic or manipulative behaviour online.<\/p><p>Third consequential amendment provides for the insertion of a new section 29(1)(i) to Part 2 of the Bill.  It provides a new function for the electoral commission to protect the integrity of elections and referendums against the dissemination or publication of online disinformation, online misinformation and manipulative or inauthentic behaviour online, in accordance with provisions of Part 5.<\/p><p>A final consequential amendment relates to the definition of &ldquo;online platform&rdquo;, which is already defined in section 118(1) of the Bill in the context of online political advertising.  It is proposed to amend the opening line of this definition to provide that an &ldquo;online platform&rdquo; means any host, operator or provider of a website.  This will ensure that the definition of &ldquo;online platform&rdquo; in Part 4 will broadly mirror that provided in the new Part 5 of the Bill, that is, the new section 142.<\/p><p>In respect of Part 5 itself, in order to better understand the principal threats to the integrity of elections and perceptions around the integrity of how elections are conducted, a number of key concepts are set out in the new Part 5, which I will now elaborate on.<\/p><p>First, &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo; is defined in the new Part 5 to refer to false or misleading content that is spread with intention to deceive and which may cause public harm.  Second, &ldquo;misinformation&rdquo; is broadly taken to mean false or misleading content shared without harmful intent, though the effects may still be harmful.  Finally, a broad principled approach is taken with regard to the meaning of &ldquo;manipulative or inauthentic behaviour&rdquo;, given this type of behaviour is ever-evolving.  In this regard, &ldquo;manipulative or inauthentic behaviour&rdquo; means tactics, techniques and procedures that: constitute a deceptive use of services or features provided by an online platform, including user conduct, having the object of artificially amplifying the reach or perceived public support of particular content; are likely to influence the information visible to other users of the platform; by reason of their nature, character, context or any other relevant circumstance give rise to the interference that they are intended to result in the dissemination, publication or increased circulation of false or misleading online electoral information; and may cause public harm.<\/p><p>Following on from these broad concepts, the provisions of the new Part 5 will provide the electoral commission with monitoring and investigations functions with regard to the dissemination or disinformation relating to online electoral information and misinformation relating to online electoral process information, as well as functions to prevent manipulative or inauthentic behaviours online.  These powers of investigation may be used by the electoral commission or under a new power delegation by its chief executive, authorised officers or members of staff under general direction of and subject to such conditions as may set out by the commission.  The new Part 5 will: require online platforms to report possible disinformation, misinformation or manipulative, inauthentic behaviour in the online sphere to electoral commission at the beginning of an electoral campaign period; require online platforms to put in place a notification mechanism for users to report possible disinformation relating to online electoral information and misinformation relating online electoral process information; provide for the establishment of an advisory board to provide advice to the electoral commission on the nature and effect of disinformation and misinformation on the use by the commission of its powers under this Part; provide for the establishment of a stakeholder council to provide advice and opinions to the commission generally and in relation to the preparation and use of codes of conduct under this Part; and provide powers to the electoral commission in respect of its monitoring and investigatory functions, including the power to the chief executive to issue, during an electoral campaign period, a take down notice, a correction notice, a labelling order, an access blocking order or a notice containing a statement that the online content has been affected by unlawful bot activity.  An appeal against any of these notices or orders may be made to an appeal panel established by the electoral commission and any person so affected by such a notice or order may also seek relief by way of an application for judicial review.  In addition, the new Part 5 will require the electoral commission to consider the impacts of its actions on specified rights under a constitution.  It provides that the electoral commission may publish codes of conduct that will be developed in consultation with an advisory board and a stakeholder council.  Codes of conduct may be optional or mandatory and may apply to online platforms, candidates at an elections, political parties, third parties and other relevant persons.   Further, it provides for offences and penalties for a failure to comply with any of the proposed notices or orders for breach of mandatory codes of conduct, for breaches of the obligations of online platforms, for the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, and for using a bot to cause or manipulate online presences directed towards influencing elections, misleading persons as to the bot&rsquo;s artificial identify or causing public harm.  Offences may be prosecuted summarily or on indictment, depending on the severity of the offence.<\/p><p>On citizens&rsquo; rights, recent experience across the world demonstrates that many of the most pressing threats to the integrity of democracy and electoral processes are based on harmful techniques for distorting or manipulating public expression.  In that context, any measures to counter these threats will likely have some impact on our rights under the Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular, the right to freedom of expression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022063000002#AA00600","speaker":"1512","continuing":true}]
