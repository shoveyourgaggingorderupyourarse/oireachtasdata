This is borne out by the fact that, in 2012, some 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement.  The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years.

In that way we can ensure we do our utmost to keep that economic activity and those small businesses operating at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200012#K00500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1358866800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I fully understand the Deputy's point of view, particularly where it relates to a multiplicity of suppliers, for example, in the area of stationery provision.<\/p><p>This issue, among others, will be discussed at the meeting on 28 January between the Department and the national procurement service.

In particular, this has been the case in respect of promises the Minister made while in opposition on the registration fee whereby students' fees have been increased rather than decreased, as had been promised.  Institutions in the third level sector face difficulties in ascertaining what will be their status in the medium term and what precisely this reform will mean for them.  While they have been asked to revert with suggestions, there is a concern that what will transpire will be a reduction of and restriction in the breadth of courses available, rather than an opportunity for institutions to grow arising from these reforms.  Although some duplication undoubtedly exists, which can be addressed, this issue appears to be the primary focus thus far with regard to the reform process.  However, that part of the process pertaining to how the third level sector might be developed further has not been getting the requisite attention and justifiable concerns exist within the sector as to what will be the development potential in the future, as opposed to further cuts to the services being provided at present.

I can talk separately about the university and wider third-level college sectors because initial teacher education has been dealt with separately.  Both Deputies will be familiar with the proposal whereby 19 institutions have been brought down to six configurations.  In respect of the IOT sector, following the publication of the Hunt report just two years ago in January 2011, the document was circulated.  On foot of the recommendations of the aforementioned report, the HEA wrote to all 14 of those institutions, asking where they saw themselves in the future and what plans did they have for themselves.  They submitted a set of proposals last summer, which were then evaluated by the HEA.  As I indicated at a gathering of all the presidents and chairpersons of the aforementioned institutions, the HEA stated there was considerable double-counting, as well as a lot of aspirational expressions of hope that did not fit reality.  Moreover, estimates of additional research funding and of foreign students were unrealistic because the same two, three or four institutions were estimating the same number of foreign students, thereby double or triple-counting.  In the past week, in the second stage of the process, an initial response by the HEA has gone out in which the authority has set out configurations or clustering it considers to be realistic.  This document has been sent out for consideration, discussion and response by the institutions themselves, which is the second stage.  The third stage then will be when they revert to discuss it or when they have communicated with the HEA.<\/p><p> The HEA at the end of March will produce a report and ask institutions what they want to do in future in a wide open sense.  That is the first stage.  We have responded to the unrealistic nature of some of what they are aspiring too.  We have also asked them for a much more detailed specific recommendation, indicating that all things being considered, this is what is being recommended to the Minister on the path that should be travelled.  That is what I will receive at the beginning of April or end of March.  I will then indicate the recommended future configuration of the institute of technology landscape in the country.

There should be an open discussion about the fact that there is nothing wrong with being gay or looking different to one's peers.  One should even be allowed wear long hair or a pink shirt.  Kids can become victims of harassment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200017#P00700","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1358868900,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy being bullied?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200017#P00800","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1358868900,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Is he bullied?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200017#P00900","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1358868900,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Deputies will be delighted to hear that I am not being bullied, not even by the media.

The House has a clear obligation to act.  As I pointed out, the State reneged on its right, responsibility and duty to protect children in its care and in the care of others who were acting on its behalf.  An apology has been made in this House and a referendum on children has been passed.  Parliament and citizens must now ensure that all those who have been or are being raped and abused have confidence that if they walk into a Garda station or contact a social worker, they will be vindicated and the State will protect their rights and ensure they receive justice in the courts.

I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on the work that has been done to date in drawing all the elements of child care and related issues into a single Department, holding a referendum on children, bringing together the excellent work being done by the Garda vetting bureau in legislation dealing with mandatory reporting and addressing a range of issues related to the welfare of children, both now and in the future.<\/p><p>  The issue raised by Deputy Kelleher in respect of the fallout from this particular case is one that concerns us all.  The case has been referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal for priority treatment and I hope it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  In that sense, the sentence will not be finally dealt with until the court makes its decision.<\/p><p>  The courage of Fiona Doyle who went through horrific and barbaric treatment as a young girl speaks for itself.  Few people can speak in the way she has been able to speak and the case has filled people with a sense of revulsion.  Unfortunately, however, it is not the only such case that has come to light over the years.  Deputy Kelleher will be well aware of other horrific cases.<\/p><p>  From my perspective, it was very important to be able to establish, at government level, a senior position dealing with the legislation that will protect all our children in the future.  This is a horrific case from the past, which is not yet over.  From speaking to people all over the country today, revulsion is a word that has come to people's minds and tongues as a result of what happened in this case.<\/p><p>  I hope the Court of Criminal Appeal will deal with the matter that has been referred to it in the shortest possible time.  I admire Fiona Doyle and hope she speaks for all those young people who have been the victims of incest, rape and brutality, which have a devastating impact on their mental strength and relations with their families.  Deputy Kelleher is clearly aware of the constraints I face in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200018#Q02700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1358869500,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I very much appreciate the need for Deputies to be very careful about how we deal with these issues and for this reason, I will ask the Taoiseach about promised legislation to reform the Courts Service and provide for a new court of appeal.  I also wish to ask about the particular problems with the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is constituted on a part-time basis.  The judges who sit in the court are drawn from the High Court and Supreme Court and have significant additional obligations elsewhere.  Consequently, the court has a backlog and victims and accused persons experience major delays in having their cases processed.  This has led to inconsistency and a lack of clarity in sentencing.<\/p><p>As we have seen, more coherence is necessary, particularly in respect of sexual offences against children.  As the Taoiseach has acknowledged, there is widespread public concern following the outcome of yesterday's decision in the rape case in the Central Criminal Court.<\/p><p> My father was an abuser.  Abuse creates in a family devastation that is beyond description.  It takes a very strong family to cope.  I am blessed that I have one.

Sometimes, we lose sight of the really fundamental important issues in life in respect of families and relations with each other because of inadequacies of one element of our system or not.<\/p><p>  Deputy Adams is well aware of the clear difference between the Oireachtas, the Government and the Judiciary and the clear lines of demarcation that are there.  That is not to say that, as an Oireachtas, we should not discuss what it is we think is in the best interests of dealing with these kinds of situation that arise in our society with devastating impact for individuals and for families.  I would certainly be happy to arrange, at an appropriate time, that we discuss within the Oireachtas the proposals the Minister for Justice and Equality is considering in respect of changes in the courts system.  I obviously remind the Deputy that, to date, the Minister has already brought about some of the most fundamental changes in the legal system in more than 200 years.<\/p><p>  This is a matter that is of interest to the Minister.  I would suggest that we should have a discussion about what the Oireachtas feels should be put in place for the future, given that there are inadequacies in some respects in our courts system as it currently applies in terms of consistency, membership and the capacity to respond quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200019#R00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1358870100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his answer.

This is not uncommon.<\/p><p>  I am not making a partisan point; I want to make a point in a fraternal way.  Hundreds - maybe even scores of hundreds, for all I know - of women and children flee domestic and sexual abuse at home but cannot get accommodation.  Any of the organisations that cater for those victims would tell one this.  I refer to the Rape Crisis Centre and the other organisations working in this area.<\/p><p>  Cuts in the number of people providing counsel, advice, assistance, support, love and protection are also having a sizable impact.  Many of the homeless people we see on the streets who have fallen victim to drug or alcohol abuse also suffered sexual or other abuse in their earlier lives, either at home or at the hands of those in institutions.  We need a wrapped around view.<\/p><p>  As the Taoiseach and the Government are busy, and leaving aside ideological differences, it sometimes takes a case like this to shock us into responding in this way.

What happened in this case?  When one sees the barring orders, the Rape Crisis Centre and the women's refuge, it is not all about money because there is fear in houses and complete domination in others.  There are clearly women in Irish homes who suffer the ignominy and terror of being beaten up.  To a much lesser extent, there are a number of males on the other hand who get subjected to particular pressures.<\/p><p>  This is an issue we need to debate.  That is why, from the point of view of children, the protection of children, the reporting about children and the vetting of adults dealing with children and who have access to children, the Government has a very clear position, one that is being worked on on a continuous basis and in respect of which the people have  voted in regard to the rights, opportunities and responsibilities in regard to children.  There is nothing more fundamental to Ireland and Irish society than this and I would be happy to arrange for an appropriate debate here where Members could give their views.<\/p><p>  Clearly, the experience of individual Members of the Oireachtas ranges across a very broad spectrum but I think that, in the interests of assisting the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has particular proposals in respect of the courts, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who has an ongoing programme in regard to children, these are issues we need to examine.<\/p><p>  I have seen people in the teaching profession who failed to see where clearly there were issues arising in families.  There are others who, when they did identify, were not able to have it pursued because what happens behind closed doors oftentimes can be quite horrific and traumatic.  That goes to the heart of everybody.<\/p><p>  I do not have any objection, arising both from Deputy Adam's question and from Deputy Kelleher's, to having an appropriate debate both about the proposals of the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of reform of the courts system and about his and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs's proposals as to where we go in regard to the future.<\/p><p>  As I said, it is not all about the amount of money made available to the Rape Crisis Centre or the women's refuge centre, the issues arising from barring orders or all of these things.  They are all part of society.  Too much of it was locked away, and frustration, anger and all of the other consequences followed.  I admire Fiona Doyle's courage.

They are now known as the working poor and are barely above the threshold for a medical card.  Going to see a GP and purchasing a prescription could amount to a quarter of their weekly income.  In ten years, GP fees in this country have risen from an estimated &euro;20 to &euro;55.  Some GPs still charge &euro;60.  In France today a GP charges &euro;22.  We now have a situation where people are choosing between paying their mortgage and going to see a GP.  Once again, it looks as though the banks are winning out over the welfare of ordinary people.<\/p><p> Because of the exorbitant costs of seeing a GP, two distinct trends are now emerging in the nation&rsquo;s health.  First, a huge volume of people are cutting back on medication and trying to stretch it out.  The big examples relate to medication for blood pressure and cholesterol.  Pharmacists now report that many people, including those with chronic ailments and conditions such as asthma and heart problems, take their medication every other day in order to save going to a GP and paying for the medicine.  Does the Taoiseach agree that those two trends are a ticking time-bomb for the nation&rsquo;s health?<\/p><p> Customs officials informed me that in a three-month period last year they seized 300,000 prescription drugs.  The Taoiseach and I are both aware of the many people who bulk buy cholesterol tablets, inhalers and antibiotics in Spain.  Does he consider it just and fair that when every other worker in the country has been asked to take a substantial pay cut and almost all workers have had no pay increase for five or six years, GPs and pharmacists rip off working people by charging exorbitant prices?  Last week a lady in Waterford with a take-home pay of &euro;397 who came to see me had paid &euro;137 to a GP.<\/p><p> When will the Government commence the reform of competition and practice in the health sector, as set out in the memorandum of understanding with the troika?

The focus of my Department is to ensure that Government policy is progressed across the whole of Government and it has one key programme which is to support the Taoiseach and the Government.  The strategy statement is aligned to the Government's key priorities and policies, and sets out eight long-term goals as follows: tackling the economic crisis, with a particular focus on jobs and growth; ensuring Ireland plays a full and effective role in all aspects of the European Union; overseeing the full implementation of the programme for Government; providing excellent support services for the Taoiseach and Government; helping to reform and restore trust in the institutions of the State and in Ireland&rsquo;s reputation at home and abroad by learning lessons from the past; helping to renew and transform the public service; helping to ensure that Government policies and services support a socially inclusive and fair society; and helping to maintain peace and to further enhance relationships on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.<\/p><p>It also identifies horizontal action areas in support of these goals, including policy capacity, implementation, communications, strategic thinking, working with others and changing the culture and rebuilding trust.<\/p><p> The strategy statement reflects the significant restructuring of the Department following the election of the new Government in 2011, including the establishment of the Economic Management Council, a new Cabinet committee structure, a programme for Government office, an office of the T&aacute;naiste, a new integrated European affairs division and the transfer of staff and functions relating to public service reform to the new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> Earlier this year my Department carried out a skills and qualifications survey of staff working in the Department and prepared a new human resources strategy to ensure that it is well placed to support me and the Government as we tackle the challenges facing the country.  The Department's policy capacity has also been enhanced through the secondment of staff with relevant skills from the National Economic and Social Council and Forf&aacute;s, as well as the recruitment of a number of staff as part of the new Government economic and evaluation service.  The Department has also recruited some staff on a temporary basis for the EU Presidency.<\/p><p> My Department supports me and the Government in making progress on the goals in the strategy statement in a number of ways, including through providing secretariat for meetings of the Government, the Economic Management Council and Cabinet committees, chairing senior officials groups, supporting me in my role as a member of the European Council and the work of the programme for Government office.  As regards monitoring of the action plan for jobs, my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation co-chair a committee which monitors the progress made by Departments and agencies on completing the actions outlined in the plan.  This committee reports to the Cabinet committee for economic recovery and jobs.<\/p><p> In addition, my Department co-ordinates the preparation of Ireland's national reform programme, NRP, and related progress reports under the Europe 2020 strategy, incorporating reporting from Ministers and Departments with responsibility for targets and measures in their respective areas.  In keeping with previous years, and the road map for the European Semester 2013, the date for NRP submissions is set for mid-April and my Department is commencing arrangements for the preparation of Ireland's update.  This will allow for an update to be provided on the implementation of the policies identified to deliver on each of the five targets under Europe 2020.<\/p><p> All of the work I have outlined seeks to deliver a whole-of-Government response to the challenges facing the country, including critical priorities such as economic growth and job creation.  Progress is reviewed on a regular basis by my Department's management advisory committee and by senior management in each division.  The Secretary General holds a quarterly meeting with all staff at which progress across all aspects of the strategy statement is reviewed.  Progress reports on key policy areas are also considered by the Government and\/or the relevant Cabinet committee on a regular basis.  My Department's annual report for 2012 will give an overview of progress on all aspects of the strategy statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200020#S02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358871300,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I wish the Taoiseach well on assuming the Presidency of the Council of the European Union recently.  He has got off to a flying start.  It behoves all Members of the House to indicate our strong support for the Taoiseach in the critical six months ahead.  I wish to commit the support of our party to the Taoiseach in the initiatives he will take.<\/p><p>  The strategy statement from the Taoiseach's Department is a very impressive document.  When he launched it the Taoiseach spoke about the transformative effect it would have on the way government is conducted.  To date, we have seen little of a transformative nature happening, or at least little of a transformative nature that is positive.  I have in mind what happened in the period preceding the last budget.  We discussed this on the last occasion I was in the House for Taoiseach's questions.  Rather than a very active participation by all Ministers in the process of Cabinet and doing what the core principle of the strategy says should be done, when it refers to the importance of open discussion and listening to discordant voices, the Economic Management Council appears to have made the major decisions, and the leaks and informed statements from Ministers in the aftermath of the budget suggest that the worst and most unfair cuts were only revealed by the Economic Management Council to the Cabinet when it was too late to change them.<\/p><p>  Last week, the Government made a major announcement about a special Cabinet meeting on jobs.  Given the cross-cutting role the Taoiseach is now taking across all Government Departrments, one could not but be a little surprised that he was having a special Cabinet meeting on jobs at this point when one would have expected, given the strategy statement, that the key issue of jobs would have been a critical issue in all Cabinet meetings.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would explain that situation further.<\/p><p>  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures show there has been little progress in the area of labour activation measures.  The Taoiseach needs to do more in this area and in the area of re-skilling.  A Private Members' motion last week set out the real difficulties that are arising in post-leaving certificate courses, PLCs, and further education, where the cutback by the Minister for Education and Skills is making it more difficult for people to access re-skilling opportunities.  Where re-skilling opportunities are in place the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is creating a situation where those innovative courses and skilled course deliverers are at risk of losing their places to deliver these re-skilling opportunities.<\/p><p>  Finally, I was struck by a supreme irony last week when one of my colleagues, Deputy Dara Calleary, tabled a question to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, about the issue of employment and jobs.  The Minister's response was that the matter of jobs was the responsibility of his colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  The theory of a whole-of-Cabinet approach is absolutely superb, but if our experience of the reality is something quite different, the Taoiseach's strategy, while a great document, is not being implemented in an effective way.  What is the Taoiseach's response to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200021#T00200","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1358871300,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his support for the country in the context of the Government holding the Presidency of the European Union.  Ireland will not have the opportunity to hold the Presidency again until 2026 or 2027, so there has been a focus from Europe on an effective Presidency by Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Government has prepared well for this.  We have had a good start with the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and through personal engagement by 14 Ministers this week with the committees of the European Parliament across a range of issues.  From that point of view the conclusion of a multi-annual framework or budget for the European Union from 2014 to 2020 will be an important element of this Presidency, and the Presidency is very much lined up with the President of the EU Council, Herman von Rompuy, in that regard.  Assuming that he decides it will be opportune to hold a meeting in February to conclude on a figure for the budget for 2014 to 2020, that will not be the end of the game.  Under the Lisbon treaty the European Parliament must give its consent and approval for any such budget and the Presidency, held by Ireland, will have to deal with the Parliament in respect of getting that through.<\/p><p>  That leads on to the capacity to deal with the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and up to 70 legislative measures, or files as they are called in Europe, to be dealt with by the Parliament.  The European elections take place next year and this will be the last Presidency before the electoral process at European level begins to focus on those elections.  In that sense, the Deputy can take it that the Government will work very hard on its responsibilities for dealing with these matters.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Economic Management Council, the Deputy will be aware that the ceilings for spending have been set for the next number of years.  We have set out the strategy for what we must do to get our deficit below 3% by 2015.  On the run up to the budget this year, these matters are always, and have always been, subject to the usual cynical comment that things are leaking from Cabinet or from individual meetings and so forth.<\/p><p>The more people around the table - 30 or 40 officials from different Departments - the more things are likely to get scattered.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform sat down with individual Ministers and had bilateral meetings about their spending ceilings and proposals to make reductions in their budgets for 2013.  By and large, that was dealt with successfully.  The Economic Management Council had to deal with a number of issues and did that to the extent that we were able to conclude the budget for 2013 with a hell of a lot less of the speculation, allegation and rumour that had floated around during the preparation of the 2012 budget.  Under the European semester, the budget may be earlier this year.  The date is not fixed yet but it could be a number of weeks earlier than last year's budget announcement because we are required to be more open about these things.  We do not object to that but the final decisions are obviously a matter for Government.<\/p><p> On the jobs question, I specifically called a meeting last week to deal with the issue of jobs and employment.  The reason I did is normal Cabinet meetings cover 20 to 25 items, including reports, international material and so on.  The Deputy is aware of this and in the course of any normal meeting, there are opportunities and potential for job creation but I thought this would be important given the fact that a change of attitude is clearly beginning to happen here.  Over the past three days, some people in the media were more than surprised to find the extent of positive news emanating from decisions that are being made, which are a reflection of interest in the country.  That is in everybody's interest in terms of confidence.  I felt it appropriate to ask every Minister to prepare a specific memorandum relevant to his or her own Department dealing with short term, medium term and longer term opportunities for employment because the problem here and in other countries was that when a recession ended, it normally took a decade for that to filter down to the ground to the average citizen in terms of their understanding that it was over and, therefore, that opportunities presented themselves.  I want to short-circuit that.  In essence, we are injecting the capacity to grow the economy and, on top of that, to make decisions at political level that can impact on job creation in the short term.  Clearly, there is serious potential for jobs in the energy, communications, marine, agriculture and construction sectors.<\/p><p> This leads me to the reason I did that.  I hope to have regular, or, as appropriate, Cabinet meetings focused on employment and job creation where I can follow through on the targets and objectives set by each Minister as they affect the Deputy's constituency and the country as a whole and that will be positive.  When I look at the live register, I am not happy with the level of unemployment, though I noticed in the CSO figures a revolving number of approximately 36,000 every month in 2012 where people signed off and others signed back on.  Nobody wants people out of work, yet during the three years prior to the Government's election in 2011, some 250,000 jobs were lost in the private sector.  I am glad to report that over the past 12 to 18 months, between 12,000 and 20,000 new jobs were created in the private sector, which is a positive trend.  The JobBridge scheme is a private sector initiative and it was intended to create 5,000 positions but more than 13,000 have been filled to date and it has been well accepted internationally as a model for the kind of thing we should do.  I said previously that, on the way back from Bucharest recently, I called to see the Austrian chancellor who is preparing for the next European Presidency.  Austria's level of youth unemployment is approximately 3% whereas it is 29% here, which is much too high.  We have lessons to learn from other countries about how they deliver on opportunities for young people, in particular, to get into training, new careers and so on.<\/p><p> From a point where our reputation was in shreds and we had no capacity to enter any market, I am glad to see that interest rates have fallen from more than 14% to approximately 3.5%.  I am glad to see the sale of Bank of Ireland paper recently for &euro;1 billion, which is more money back for the taxpayer.  That is important but it is only a beginning and, obviously, we have a long way to go.  The continuing negotiations at European level in respect of the ECB, Eurogroup and ECOFIN are of critical importance to us to exit the programme successfully.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to reform and transforming government.  We have made a number of decisions, including the establishment of the HR shared services centre for the Civil Service, PeoplePoint, which will reduce head count by 17% and costs by more than 25%.  Last June, the Government agreed to implement the mandatory use of framework agreements for commonly produced goods and services, which is expected to yield between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million in savings across the public service annually.  Last September, we agreed to set up the national procurement office, which would produce savings of up to &euro;600 million if it is handled properly, and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, is dealing with that.  We announced the radical reform of local government, which will be the biggest in 100 years, to save the taxpayer more than &euro;430 million by replacing 114 local authorities with 31 integrated authorities and reducing the number of members from 1,627 to 950.  I appointed the fiscal council independently to give its view on the country.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform publishes online purchase orders for the procurement of goods and services worth more than &euro;20,000 as a first step in extending that process to all Departments.  We still have a long way to.  We amended the Freedom of Information Acts to give greater transparency and we passed legislation to overhaul political donations.  We also passed criminal justice legislation to tackle white collar crime and so on.<\/p><p> Clearly, our focus has to be on increasing our competitiveness, putting the structures in place to sort our problems with our public finances and changing the way business is done, for instance, in the health sector and through strong labour market activation measures within the Department of Social Protection such as JobBridge, the new Intreo service which is linked to the Department of Education and Skills and which published the SOLAS Bill earlier, to address training and opportunities for young people.  We are at the two-year mark in this Administration and, for me, restructuring public services and the public finances and a relentless drive to create opportunities for jobs and improve access to credit for small and medium enterprises will grow indigenous confidence, which is what we need to get back.<\/p><p> When people ask whether we can return to where we were, I say we should not go back because in the 2000s, we had a system built on debt, property and recklessness.  We need to be competitive through investment and innovation, which is the position we were in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when we were creating 1,000 jobs a week.  We have a long way to go to get to that but we are headed in the right direction.  These are a few pointers that have us heading in that direction and we intend to keep on with this plan in terms of sorting everything out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200021#T00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358871900,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I have three questions and with the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence, I would like to put one now and if there is time later, come back with another, le do thoil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200022#U00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1358871900,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200022#U00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1358871900,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p><p>In &eacute;ineacht leis an Teachta &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l gu&iacute;m &aacute;th ar an Taoiseach ina r&oacute;l mar Uachtar&aacute;n ar an Aontas Eorpach.

The Taoiseach has spoken about monitoring, trying to achieve cohesion and getting everyone working together.  On 29 September last, the Government announced a strategic investment fund and indicated that legislative change would be needed to allow for resources to be channelled from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, into the productive economy.  It is now 2013, the legislative programme has been published and this legislation is not included in it.  I presume the heads of the Bill have not been agreed.  There does not seem to be any indication that the legislation is due for publication in this term.  If this priority was being focused on and monitored, we would be dealing with this important matter in this session.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can give us this assurance when he responds to my question.<\/p><p> Funds from the NPRF were to have been channelled into this fund.  Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for funds from the NPRF to be used to stimulate the economy.  The Taoiseach used to rubbish that suggestion in times past.  I welcome his conversion to this point of view.  The process needs be driven by the Taoiseach's Department and other Departments, particularly the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p> Can the Taoiseach assure the House, in the ongoing process of Government, that this announcement of 2011 will become a reality?  When will that happen?  What is the timeframe for that?  If there is still a need for legislation when will we see the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200022#U00400","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358872500,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith ag an Teachta Adams.

Facilities that are the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality and the schools initiatives are under way.  I would like to see much more.  The European Investment Bank is of a mood to invest more in sustainable projects in Ireland.  I can give the House the details of those.<\/p><p>  The legislation the Deputy refers to should be published during this session and will lead to the creation of NewERA which will, in turn, lead to serious investment in major projects amounting to several billion euro.  We have some work to do to finalise the Bill.  The negotiations in which we are involved at a European level have the potential to relieve the extent of the country's debt.  That will be important psychologically, but economically it will mean that investors and markets will understand that Ireland is in a more relieved economic situation than heretofore, it will be easier for banks to borrow on the market, which they are now tending to do, interest rates will be lower and more flexible and credit will be available for small and medium enterprises to expand and create employment.  That is another reason the NPRF made &euro;850 million available in the last fortnight for lending to small and medium enterprises in three different sectors.  All these things are to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  Many small business people have come through a very difficult time in recent years.  I note, however, that 55% of small business now say they expect to employ people in 2013.  They are investigating the potential of online sales.  The challenge for Government, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the local enterprise offices is to explain to small operators what credit is on offer and the assistance that can be given through budgetary measures such as PRSI and VAT reductions and whatever the Minister for Finance may decide to add to the Finance Bill.  The Deputy is aware that the Minister included ten measures in the budget.  Each individually was not of major significance but collectively they are an opportunity for small businesses to make their way to becoming thriving enterprises and employing people.<\/p><p>  I expect the legislation during this session.  We will have an opportunity to debate it in the House.  If we get this right, it will provide capacity for investment in worthwhile projects.  I will publish the details of the progress being made on the stimulus package announced by the Minister last year and the preparations for further bundles of schools, facilities under the Department of Justice and Equality and a number of remaining major environmental issues that need to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200023#V00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1358872500,"counter":217,"content":"<p>In his Department's strategy statement, the Taoiseach highlighted a number of priorities.  The top one was jobs and growth.  That reflected the Fine Gael campaign slogan which was to get Ireland working.  Most people would say the country's priority is jobs, jobs, jobs and jobs again if we are to have any chance of getting out of the mess we were in.<\/p><p>  There is an element of the politics of illusion in documents like this.  The illusionist uses one hand to distract the audience while the other gets on with the real business.  The strategy would be a wonderful document if its noble aspirations for jobs and growth were being delivered upon.  The reality, however, is that the Government's projection is that there will be no change in net employment by the end of this year.  By the end of 2015, the best case scenario is that we may see a reduction of between 1% and 1.5% in the level of unemployment.  The Nevin Institute says that will not materialise and there will, in fact, be an increase in the level of unemployment.<\/p><p>  Whenever this point is put to the Taoiseach he mentions some of the, always welcome, job announcements.  Of course we all welcome these.  I welcome the creation of 500 jobs associated with the development of DCU.  What we gain on the swings, however, we lose on the roundabout of austerity.  For every job created at least the same number is lost.  That has been the case since the Taoiseach and his colleagues entered Government and will continue to be the case until the end of this year, at least.  This suggests that the commitment in his strategy document to create jobs and growth is not being delivered upon.<\/p><p>Part of the problem is the oft repeated mantra by many of the Ministers that the Government does not create jobs, it creates the conditions for creating jobs.  That is the problem because no one else is going to create the jobs in the current economic climate.  The banks certainly are not going to create them.  Private investment is very small relative to the huge unemployment hole in our economy.  The State must step in and create the jobs otherwise even the Government's own forecasts are for negligible impact on the chronic unemployment crisis.<\/p><p> I ask the Taoiseach if he will re-prioritise and refocus on the issue of jobs.  Will he review the Government's approach to employment creation in this State?  A 0% change in unemployment by the end of the year is not good enough to offer the Irish people when we are suffering from chronic mass unemployment and emigration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200023#V00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358873100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on one thing, that jobs should be the priority.  As he said himself on four occasions, it is about jobs, jobs, jobs and jobs.  We will not have a country we can be proud of and face with courage into the future unless we deal with our problems here.  They are our public finances, the structures of the way a number of Departments have operated in the past, and a relentless drive to deal with jobs.<\/p><p>  As I said to Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, it is a fact that between 2008 and 2011, 250,000 jobs were lost in the private sector.  In the last 12 months, 12,000 jobs have been created in that sector.  It is a trend moving in the right direction; it is not by any means where we need to be but we are headed in that direction.<\/p><p>  Last week I visited Fleetmatics at Tallaght.  This is an Irish company with its global headquarters here in Ireland.  It currently has GPS locating systems on 300,000 vehicles worldwide and it is going to expand its business to a truly global sense in the very near future.  That company employs in the main IT specialist operators.  I was in Sky's Dublin office, which currently employs 490 people and that will increase to more than 1,000 by the end of summer - 900 was the initial figure but it expects to beat 1,000.  They are all young, energetic people dealing with what they see as a very competitive situation here in Ireland where the company  has set up its own headquarters.  Indeed, the humble potato, with a turnover of &euro;100 million in Tayto Park in Ashbourne in County Meath, saw 78 new jobs announced last week in the adjoining facility.  These are people who make decisions at this time to invest money and to employ people.  We want to see more of that.  I was in two places over the last week, one employed 21 people and another employed 10.  They are small operators but they have the confidence to make the decisions.  I am sure Deputy Boyd Barrett wants this as much I do.<\/p><p>  I do not deal in illusions, I must deal with reality.  I heard the economist, Mr. Collins from the Nevin Economic Research Institute, say the one thing we can be sure of is that economists will be wrong.  They hold a very different view from IBEC, which is projecting a 1.8% growth rate for this year, ahead of most other organisations referring to the potential of the country.  If markets are pricing in the fact that Ireland is now in a very different position than it was, that is good.  It is a sign of positivity and confidence and that has been reflected in the fact Bank of Ireland was able to sell &euro;1 billion worth of paper recently, which was a big change.  The banks are moving to a point of being able to compete on the market without State guarantees, which we hope will end in the period ahead, and enable them return to the markets.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right when he says it is not a case of the Government creating jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200024#W00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1358873100,"counter":220,"content":"<p>No, the Taoiseach said that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200024#W00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1358873100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>The public sector has had a major exit in reducing numbers, its cost and its scale.

Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l referred to this also.  We need to have our country focused on being competitive,export driven, creative and innovative.  I am glad to see the investment made by previous Governments in research, innovation and education is now beginning to pay dividends.  Whoever stands here in the next ten years will be in a very different world, with biotechnology, genetics, robotics, nanotechnology and medicine, the Internet and all of the changes that are coming at us with bewildering speed and that will create new jobs and new opportunities.<\/p><p>  I had the opportunity on Sunday to meet Mr. Spielberg and hopefully another Oscar winner for the third time, Daniel Day Lewis, in respect of their major production of &quot;Lincoln&quot; and I hope it is an outstanding success.  Mr. Spielberg made the point to me that the country offers enormous potential in that area by being consistent in terms of what we offer and having capacity for production.  They are very pleased with the creative ingenuity of the Irish personality.  Deputy Boyd Barrett accepts that from what has already been achieved over the years.  That is why in the budget, section 431 was extended to 2020, giving an opportunity for investment.  People of that stature and global influence say these are the things we need.  They also say that in our education sector, either at university or the colleges of technology, we should be delving into the enormous potential of the digital era that is coming.  That is just part of the process we have to deal with during the Presidency, the putting together of the digital Single Market.<\/p><p>  It is all about jobs; Deputy Boyd Barrett and I are as one on this, which is a change.  This is very important for every family in the country as we hope to move to a point where there is excitement again in young people's lives, where they can see opportunity and can understand that by difficult decisions having to be made, the consequence is international recognition of being competitive and of confidence in our indigenous economy.  By sorting out our public finances, there will be the capacity to lend to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be the main creators of the next evolution of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>  I hope that when this Administration has done its job, this will never happen again and we that we will have put in place a system that is streamlined, effective, competitive, where people's money does not go astray and where there is value for money.  In Deputy Boyd Barrett's constituency and Deputy Higgins's constituency, people will be able to say there is an opportunity for job creation.  That is what I saw in Tallaght the other day, in Sky's Dublin office and in Ashbourne.  There is a growing sense that we have come through a very difficult time but I see higher ground ahead and it is the challenge of Government to assist those entrepreneurs, investors and workers who are prepared to say they will take a chance on this.  Hopefully it will work out for them.  Some will and some will not be successful but it is important we have that energy and drive evident in our economy and our society.  I hope that is where we are leading to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200024#W00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1358873100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his wide ranging response to the initial questions we put down but I do not know that I learned much.

He referred to freedom of information, saying it has been a priority issue for him and he has made positive comments about it.

He stated in the past that he has increased his co-ordination of Ministers generally and that he has a general oversight of what is happening in the Department of Health.  In the context of that and the strategy statement, what did the Taoiseach do last year when it emerged that the budget for the Department of Health was seriously off track and what is he doing to deal with the growing lack of confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly?  While I have a great deal of regard for Deputy Reilly, have known him for many years and he is sincere in his commitment, and while he did win a motion of confidence in this House, I can assure the Taoiseach that he would win no motion of confidence among the people who despair about the current state of the health services.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach stated that currently there are 1.8 million persons on medical cards and that is a growing number.  Of course it is growing because incomes right across society are declining.  I put it to him that it is paradoxical that the HSE's service plan for 2013 envisages there being 40,000 fewer medical cards in place.  Recently I had a meeting - one of an ongoing series of meetings - with the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, one of the most laudable charitable organisations in this country, run by a man, Mr. Jonathan Irwin, who is a national treasure in terms of the work that he is doing in the area of palliative care for seriously ill children.  It offends me, and the Taoiseach must be personally offended, that these small children are encountering inordinate difficulties in having medical cards provided to them and have had in other instances the discretionary medical cards provided to them withdrawn, albeit that their circumstances will never improve and they are on an almost inexorable road in terms of their prognosis and the palliative care they receive.  I make a personal plea to the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200024#W00500","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358873700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>We are dealing with questions to the Taoiseach, not the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200025#X00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1358873700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>It certainly is part of the Taoiseach's strategy statement, he has this overarching role and oversight of Departments, and he raised the issue of health.

He met the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss this recently and he is awaiting the response of and proposals from the committee.  Following consideration of the views and recommendations of the committee and the drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I expect that Bill to be published in this session.<\/p><p>  The general scheme of the Bill is available on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for all to see.  As part of the legislative proposal, freedom of information will be extended to a number of high profile public bodies, including the Central Bank of Ireland, the NTMA and NAMA.  Subject to the formal consultation required with the ECB, it is proposed that the Central Bank will be brought under the Freedom of Information Acts other than in respect of records that are subject to professional secrecy obligations, in particular under EU law and euro system requirements.<\/p><p>  The public financial bodies, including the NTMA and NAMA, the NPRF and the NDFA, will all be brought within the jurisdiction of the Acts subject, in particular, to the maintenance of strict confidentiality of their engagement with their commercial counterparts, for example, in securing external private finance for the State.  It is not proposed to bring the other banks under the legislation as they would not have policy or regulatory functions such as those held by the Central Bank.  A question on that has been tabled for reply tomorrow as well.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health, irrespective of Governments over the years, has been a Department that impacts on the lives of every household in the country at some stage or other.  Clearly, when the Government led by Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l's party put all the health boards together, put the superstructure of the HSE on top of that and expected it to work efficiently, it was never going to happen.  To be honest with the Deputy, what used to apply when the Minister of the day would present his or her budget to the Cabinet and it would be approved, is that a service plan would be provided to implement that but one found afterwards that, because of demand or whatever, moneys were being moved around, not in any fraudulent fashion but where it was difficult to control what it was being spent on.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly and the Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Alex White, are now trying to change the system to one where universal health insurance will apply, where money will follow the patient and where one is able to do far more, far more effectively and with less than applied in the past.  That is what is at stake here.<\/p><p>  On what I did when I heard that this was out of line last year, I had a row about it and several fairly serious discussions.  That is why the changes made by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, are moving to a point where there is far greater clarity about the programmes and the effectiveness of the voted budget for 2013 and a real emphasis on producing the legislation to give effect to the decisions made in the budget to ensure that will not happen again.<\/p><p>  It is always difficult with the health portfolio, as Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l is too well aware.  It is a Department that must be seen to run very efficiently and effectively in the interests of the people.  That is why I welcome, for example, the decision by the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that 1,000 extra nursing jobs would be provided outside the employment framework at between &euro;22,000 and &euro;25,000 a year for young Irish-trained nurses who will get experience and an opportunity to work in Irish hospitals and gain their credentials at the equivalent starting rate as exists under the NHS.  It is such decisions that impact the changed nature of the way we want to provide services.  That is why, from the Minister's perspective, one is able to say to people that we want to keep them in their home and community for as long as possible, that they will then move to a facility as close as possible but, essentially, that medical attention is given based on medical need as distinct from what they have in their pocket.  That is where, in the next few weeks, there will be the production of serious papers, in respect of both money following the patient and universal health insurance, which will be the basis for a real debate in the House, together with the publication of the Minister's decision in respect of the groupings for hospitals and the future for smaller local hospitals.  This will impact for the betterment of the delivery of health services for the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200025#X00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1358873700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>One of the Government's stated strategic objectives is to enhance relationships on this island.  Looking at how the Government does its work in terms of the modalities the Taoiseach outlined in this strategic document, he will recall that on 19 December I asked him about the bill of rights for the North.  The bill of rights, as he will recall, is one of the outstanding matters from the Good Friday Agreement.  For the past two and a half years, the British Government has used the work of a commission which it established to deal with the entire British state as an excuse for not delivering on a bill of rights in the North.  When that commission released its report in December, however, it accepted the argument of the importance of a bill of rights.<\/p><p>It stated: \"We do not wish to interfere in that process in any way nor for any of the conclusions that we reach to be interpreted or used in such a way as to interfere in, or delay, the Northern Ireland Bill of Rights process.\"  When I raised this with the Taoiseach in December - there is talk in his responses that every three months there is a report and so on - he indicated he would read the report, which he had not read at that point.  He committed to follow up with the Executive in the North and with the British authorities about this report.  Has he read the report since then?  Has the Government taken up this issue with the British Government and the North's Executive?  How does he intend to secure progress on this very important issue?<\/p><p> The Taoiseach may have heard that the DUP Minister, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, said this morning that the DUP may support my weekend call for a Border poll under the Good Friday Agreement.  This, rhetorically at least, is one of the aims of all the main parties in this D&aacute;il.  The Good Friday Agreement creates the democratic and peaceful process by which the citizens of the island can decide whatever our preference is.  Perhaps those who want the union can try to persuade and argue outlining their vision.  Those of us who want the unity of the people and of the island can do the same thing.  All of us need to work with our Unionist neighbours to try to bring this about - indeed there is a constitutional obligation on the Government to do so.  Does the Taoiseach welcome, as I have, the remarks of the Minister and would he support that as a process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200025#X00500","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358874300,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I hope we can have a discussion about the report in respect of the bill of rights when I next have an opportunity to talk to the leaders in Northern Ireland.  In regard to the Border poll, I have listened to the Deputy's comments and to those of the Minister, Ms Arlene Foster MLA.  I think she might have a slightly different view from that of the Deputy.  This is clearly a matter that is enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement, but it is a case of whether the British Government decides to have a Border poll.  I do not believe now is the time to do it and that is not to be in any way not confident about what we have to do.  It is very important that in the Twenty-six Counties we deal with our problems in a way that we can concentrate and prove that people working with Government, with assistance from our European colleagues, can actually right this ship, as it were, to a point where we can know with clarity that we are proceeding on a voyage of future prosperity and opportunity for our people, and clearly there are challenges ahead for our people here.<\/p><p>  In respect of the Six Counties, Northern Ireland, I think what the Minister, Ms Foster MLA, said was that Sinn F&eacute;in should be careful of what it wishes for, because it might happen.

It is time for the First Minister, Mr. Robinson MLA, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness MLA, and everybody else including us here, to work in the interests of restoring stability and community peace in Northern Ireland.  That is why I was very happy to propose to President Van Rompuy that the multi-annual financial framework for Europe include moneys for the PEACE programme.  When I have the opportunity to raise that with our American colleagues, I will be happy to do that also.  Clearly the Deputy knows better than most how sensitive this can be in vulnerable community areas.  I would like to see Northern Ireland really begin to prosper - it has been doing that - but this sets it back in terms of reputation and retail capacity and all the rest of it.  It is a matter for the British Government to agree whether to have a Border poll now.  Clearly if that were to happen, depending on the result, we would have to consider what would happen here.

To rectify this, we had to take many difficult decisions resulting in billions being taken out of our economy and challenges for people.

I ask the Minister for Finance to consider the return of value added tax incurred by voluntary organisations and charitable groups in the purchase of defibrillators.  The presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, leads me to assume that this issue straddles the Departments of Finance and Health.<\/p><p>  The case for making defibrillators widely available has been widely established, including by the Department of Health.  According to the Irish Heart Foundation, sudden cardiac death or SCD kills more than 5,000 people in Ireland each year.  While the majority of these deaths occur in middle age or later in life, it should be noted that 100 young people aged 35 years and under lose their lives to sudden cardiac death each year.  In other words, every week at least one person under the age of 35 years dies without warning.<\/p><p>  Studies of sudden cardiac death have shown that the time between sudden cardiac arrest and defibrillation is the most critical factor for survival.  Medical research shows there is an 80% chance of survival if a defibrillator reaches the victim within two minutes.  The same research also demonstrates that the survival rate reduces by approximately 10% for every minute that passes before defibrillation.  Although the survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is approximately 7% in Ireland, it should be noted that 123 people were saved as a direct result of the use of defibrillators in the 12 months prior to October 2012.  These individuals are still alive as a direct result of having access to defibrillators immediately after experiencing a heart attack.  <\/p><p>  A study carried out by the Department of Health in 2004 recommended that appropriate devices should be widely available, especially in sporting venues such as gyms and clubs.  This aspect is of particular concern to me and the reason I raise this issue.  When a voluntary organisation such as a sports club decides to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator, it must pay VAT amounting to 23% of the cost.  Not only do clubs not receive any Government support towards purchasing such equipment and training members to use it but they are required to pay an additional 23% VAT for the privilege of having this equipment on site.  While I accept that VAT regulations do not allow the Government to waive the VAT requirement, it is perfectly feasible for the Government to refund VAT moneys collected from voluntary groups and sporting organisations in the performance of what is a civic duty.<\/p><p>  In Cork city, it is standard practice for any club hosting a schoolboy soccer game to have a defibrillator on site.  Efforts to adhere to such codes of practice should be rewarded with a refund of the VAT incurred in purchasing a defibrillator.  If the Government were to adopt this approach, it could well be copied all over Europe.  However, for the purposes of this debate, the initiative I am proposing would definitely save lives.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200032#EE01500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1358877300,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I am pleased, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, to have the opportunity to speak on the question of the VAT treatment of defibrillators purchased by voluntary and charitable groups.<\/p><p>  While I appreciate and am conscious of the health concerns that form the basis of the Deputy's argument, he may be aware that in matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, the Government is constrained by the requirements of European Union VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, which is 23% in Ireland.  Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.  There is no provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced or zero rate to the supply of such products.  Under the EU VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991 but cannot extend it to new goods and services.  As such, a zero rate cannot be applied to defibrillators.<\/p><p>  In addition, member states may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT directive.  While Annex III includes the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use by voluntary and charitable groups.  In this regard, a reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.<\/p><p>  Exemptions from VAT are also governed by the EU VAT directive, which does not make provision for an exemption from VAT on the supply of defibrillators.  For this reason, the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate of 23%.<\/p><p>  While the VAT rate on the supply of defibrillators cannot be removed, the Deputy is seeking that compensation for this VAT be made to charitable and voluntary groups in the form of a refund of VAT.  Ireland operates a small number of VAT refunds where VAT is refunded in set circumstances, some of which apply to medical devices.  The VAT (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981 provides that individuals can obtain repayment of VAT expended on certain goods and appliances which assist persons with a disability to overcome that disability.  There may be circumstances where a defibrillator purchased by or on behalf of an individual may qualify for a VAT refund.  However, a defibrillator purchased for general use by a charity or voluntary body would not qualify for a refund under this order.  In addition, since 1987 there is provision within the Irish VAT code for the refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of new medical instrument or appliance by a person who donates the medical equipment or appliance to a hospital.  However, the refund order only applies to medical instruments or appliances costing more than &euro;25,390 and would only apply where the donation was to a hospital and not to a voluntary and charitable body.<\/p><p>  As I indicated, Irish VAT law is governed by European Union VAT law.  The EU VAT directive does not specifically provide for the introduction of schemes for VAT refund.  While providing a compensation method does not affect VAT being charged according to the directive, this is not clear cut as it is generally counter to the provision that VAT should be paid by the final consumer of goods and services.  It is for this reason that Ireland has not introduced any new VAT refund orders since the 1980s.  The existing refund orders are all historical, dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, and any changes to VAT refunds since then have been either by EU requirement or by making minor changes to existing refund orders.<\/p><p>  While voluntary and charitable groups are not compensated for the VAT incurred on defibrillators, Exchequer funding is separately made available to such organisations.  In addition, the Irish tax code also provides an exemption from various taxes for charities and certain sporting and voluntary bodies, including an exemption from VAT on supplies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200032#EE01600","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1358877900,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I thank the Minister of State for responding to this issue.  He hit the nail on the head, in that there is an anomaly in the taxation system.  An individual can get a tax rebate of 23% on the purchase of a defibrillator whereas a sporting organisation or club of volunteers cannot.  This anomaly needs to be adjusted.<\/p><p>  If there is a European VAT issue in general, there is no better time to examine this matter than as part of our European Presidency.  I call on the Minister for Finance to address it.  This anomaly does not just affect the Republic of Ireland.  Rather, it is a problem across the world.  I am sure that, if negotiations on this issue occurred at EU level, we would receive a positive response.<\/p><p>  Defibrillators are a proven life-saving measure.

We have moved on a great deal since then, particularly so in terms of this issue.  Sudden death syndrome, which arises from heart attacks, is a recognised difficulty.

It is reasonable to describe it as such, but the situation is rooted in tax law.  We are not an outlier in this regard in the European context.

This is a rule of general application.

We welcome the news that emerged from Brussels overnight regarding the possible extension of the term of the maturity of the loans drawn down under the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, as well as today's news from ECOFIN to the effect that the same extension would be considered in respect of European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, funding under Ireland's bailout agreement.<\/p><p>  While I look forward to the Minister of State setting out the Department of Finance's position, the news raises the question of why an extension has not been provided to date.  In July 2011, the Heads of Government and Heads of State agreed in a communiqu&eacute; to extend the maturity of EFSF money for Greece to up to 30 years and to apply the same maturity provision to Portugal and Ireland.  Since then, I have asked the Minister for Finance by way of parliamentary questions in the Chamber about why the provision has not been extended to us.<\/p><p>  In February 2012, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, confirmed that, following on from the July 2011 communiqu&eacute;, the Council of Ministers approved in October 2011 a European Commission proposal to increase the maturity of individual tranches of lending to Ireland and Portugal from a minimum of 15 years to up to 30 years.  Clearly, this proposal has existed for quite some time.  The July 2011 communiqu&eacute; was quite categoric that the extension would apply to Ireland, yet we are being told in January 2013 that the Eurogroup and ECOFIN have asked that the extension of maturities be examined.  In some respects, we are not making progress.  We have gone from the extension being a certainty to something that requires examination.<\/p><p>  I hope the Minister of State will set out the benefits, as the Government sees them, of extending the maturity of the various loans drawn down under the EFSF and the EFSM.  The people at home will want to know whether an extension will make a difference to the types of budget we will see in the coming years.  For example, will it result in a significant reduction in the country's level of interest payments and will it make our overall debt position more sustainable?<\/p><p>  It should be pointed out that Ireland has been drawing down some funding under both of these streams for a long time.  For example, we have drawn money from the EFSM over a 30-year period and money from the EFSF for 25 and 29-year periods.<\/p><p>  We are beginning to do it.  I would welcome it if the Minister of State set out on behalf of the Department what he regarded as being the benefits to Ireland of the extension of the maturity.  The potential benefits are significant.  We all want Ireland to return to the international bond markets as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  I would also like the Minister of State to deal with the issue of the concessions extended to Greece in November that have not yet been extended to Ireland.  For example, Greece negotiated a deferral of interest payments on EFSF loans for a period of up to ten years.  Such a deferral would bring immediate cash benefits to Ireland were it extended to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200033#FF00400","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1358877900,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for his words of welcome.  I welcome his welcome, if I might put it that way, for these important developments.<\/p><p><br \/>  The meeting of the Eurogroup - the eurozone finance Ministers - yesterday had a broad agenda covering a number of issues, all of which related to the health of the euro and were important to Ireland.  However, for the purpose of this discussion, I will refer to the outcome of the discussions on the extension of maturities on EU loans for Ireland and Portugal as well as the discussions on the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, direct banking recapitalisation facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Eurogroup has agreed to examine the extension of the maturities on Ireland and Portugal's loans from the EFSF, the euro area facility.  Last night, the Minister for Finance noted that this &quot;is a very welcome and positive development&quot; and that it &quot;recognises the efforts being made by well performing programme countries&quot;.  The Minister for Finance also clarified:<blockquote>The Eurogroup agreed to refer this issue to senior officials to examine the technical details and they will report back shortly.  This has the potential to further enhance Ireland's debt sustainability and to facilitate our successful full return to the markets.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>I also remind the House that the ECOFIN meeting of all EU 27 finance Ministers has agreed to a similar request in respect of loans from the European financial stabilisation mechanism, EFSM - the EU 27 mechanism.  Deputy McGrath has acknowledged that.  These are important and potentially significant decisions.  An extension of the maturities will be beneficial for this country as it will increase the amount of our debt with longer maturity.  It has the potential to further enhance Ireland's debt sustainability and to improve our prospects of making a full return to the markets at competitive interest rates.  That will mean private sector investors should be more willing to lend to Ireland, which should reduce the cost of our borrowing.<\/p><p> I should emphasise that this decision is only made possible by our consistent, strong track record of delivering on our programme commitments.  It also reflects our considerable efforts in building support behind the scenes with our EU partners.  The examination of the proposal will now be conducted by the European Commission and senior European officials, including Irish and Portuguese officials, to assess what loans will be eligible and the revised maturity dates.  The advice of the NTMA will be a key element in our approach to this examination.  The examination by senior officials should start immediately so that they will be in a position to report as soon as possible.  The decisions taken last night and today serve as yet another example of the progress the Government is making at European level in reducing the cost of the EU-IMF programme entered into by the previous Administration.  Coupled with the agreement secured in 2011 to reduce the interest rate on our loans, an agreement that saved the Irish taxpayer &euro;9 billion in interest costs, we are making real progress in reducing the burden of the programme and positioning Ireland to make a full and sustained return to the markets at competitive rates.<\/p><p> The amount of funding potentially covered by these decisions is &euro;22.5 billion for the EFSM and &euro;17.7 billion for the EFSF.  In the case of the ESM direct banking recapitalisation proposal, the Ministers received a report on the progress being made in the technical discussions.  While further work remains to be done in this area, the Minister for Finance has stated that he is happy with progress to date.  Our discussions on reducing the cost support to the banks, including the ESM direct recapitalisation, will continue and will deliver tangible results also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200033#FF00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358878500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The issue does not affect most people.  It does not have implications for them because, happily, they are not in flood-prone areas and they have no problem getting flood insurance cover.  The Irish Insurance Federation recently informed a committee of the House that 98% of home owners are in the lucky position of being able to get flood cover.  Only a minute percentage &ndash; approximately 2% - of people cannot get flood cover.<\/p><p>  For those 2% of people who cannot get flood cover, the floods in June 2012 resulted in 1,260 claims totalling &euro;54 million.  A large number of claims were from County Cork, much of them in west Cork in the towns I represent such as Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bandon, which all have a long and increasing struggle with floods.  The towns have a history of flooding and devastation.  A total of 627 households claimed a total of &euro;15 million during a flood in 2012, which averages out at approximately &euro;24,000 per household.  Such an amount highlights the amount of damage an average house can endure during a flood event.<\/p><p>  It is a huge trauma for an individual to have their home destroyed by water, but they have the double whammy of having to clean up their home, get the dirty, filthy brown water out of the house, have their privacy invaded, return to their home with massively increased premiums and then be denied future flood cover.  People in the town of Clonakilty that I represent are literally living on their nerves since June 2012 due to the habitual flood warnings that occur.  There is a flood warning every month and at this time of year it is every week.  People put out sand bags but they do not have insurance.  They dread the prospect of being revisited by the horror of their home being flooded.<\/p><p>  I reiterate my call for a solidarity levy on home insurance policies.  The people of this country would countenance such an idea.  I expect the 98% of people who are fortunate to have home insurance would accept a levy of 1% or 2% per annum, which would amount to &euro;8 or &euro;10, to cover the 2% of people who are denied flood insurance by insurance companies.  We have precedents in the area.  In 1955 the Government led an initiative to work with insurance companies to introduce a private motor insurance scheme which offered cover for anybody who was the victim of a car accident where the parties involved were not covered by insurance.  I have examined the many examples that exist, for example in the United States, where FEMA, the national flood insurance programme, operates in various states.  In effect, it is a solidarity levy, which is accepted by people.  In this country we recently accepted a 2% levy on health insurance policies in order to salvage the Quinn group.<\/p><p>  I urge the Government to give serious consideration to working with the insurance companies.  I am aware of the steps that have been taken to date, especially by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Office of Public Works, OPW, working with insurance companies.  However, I would like to see the matter being taken a step further and for the Government to liaise with the industry to ensure an insurance scheme is introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200034#GG00500","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1358878500,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  It should be noted that flood cover and its unavailability has been raised in this House on a number of occasions, not least by Deputy Daly and others.  It is a subject with which I am most familiar.  I am also conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can cause to householders and businesses.  The Deputy outlined them in his contribution.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the substantive issue of the provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which must be based on a proper assessment of the risks the insurers are accepting.  These are often considered on a case by case basis and neither the Government nor the Central Bank has any influence over this matter.  The Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, has advised the Minister that flood insurance cover is available to approximately 98% of householders in Ireland.  It has indicated that when making underwriting decisions, insurers look at the claims history of the property and any flood protection measures implemented by the Office of Public Works, OPW, or local authority.  As a result, some people will pay a higher premium because the flood risk is higher, or will have a higher flood excess on their policy.  While insurers try to provide flood cover wherever possible, flood insurance is sometimes not economically viable, and in the interests of keeping premiums affordable for policyholders in general, the IIF says that insurers decline flood cover for new business for some risks or in certain cases have to withdraw flood cover at renewal.<\/p><p> The Office of Public Works is committed to doing all it can to alleviate the impact of flooding through the provision of defences and by taking steps to manage and reduce flood risk in the future through a strategic and sustainable approach under the national catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which, along with expenditure on maintenance of arterial drainage schemes, will see up to &euro;250 million being spent on flood relief measures over the next five years.  The Deputy, in fairness, has also referred to the fact that various measures are being taken under the direction of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and his officials in the OPW, and there have been a number of meetings with the IIF about this matter and the various initiatives that are being taken.<\/p><p> The issue of a State indemnification scheme for those unable to obtain flood cover has been raised on a number of occasions.  While it is difficult to quantify what the costs would be in a particular year, it is possible to say that the costs would be significant over a period of time on the basis of the eight major floods over the 12 year period, 2000 to 2012, costing the insurance industry approximately &euro;700 million in flood claims.  These costs are in addition to the normal infrastructure costs which arise from flooding such as repair of roads, bridges and so forth.  Furthermore, if a scheme of this type was established, there is a danger that the industry would have a strong incentive to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium and high risk areas, thus increasing the potential cost of the scheme over time.  Therefore, such an arrangement has the potential to undermine the nature of the existing private insurance regime, making it difficult to withdraw it, even if was introduced on a short-term basis.<\/p><p> The approach being adopted by the Government to ensure the availability of flood insurance consists of continuing to prioritise spending on flood relief measures by the OPW and relevant local authorities, improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry on the effectiveness of these measures, and implementation of a comprehensive and strategic approach to flood risk management through the national CFRAM programme.<\/p><p> With regard to Deputy Daly's suggestion of the introduction of a regime similar to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, system in respect of motor insurance, the problem with that proposal centres on who would fund such a scheme.  Unlike motor insurance, flood cover is not a compulsory insurance system in this State, so there would be no basis for compelling the industry to contribute to an equivalent scheme for flood cover, as is done in respect of motor insurance.  In these circumstances, the State would have to fund such an arrangement and it would, in effect, create a State indemnification scheme with major costs for the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200034#GG00600","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358879100,"counter":389,"content":"<p>A cursory glance over the records of this House shows that this issue has been raised on an increasing number of occasions, and it has been raised many times in the past 12 months.  Regrettably, the responses have not changed a great deal since early last year.  That is a poor consolation and comfort to the people I represent in west Cork where there is a high concentration of people who cannot get insurance in towns such as Skibbereen, Bandon and Clonakilty and villages such as Rathbarry, Ballinascarty and Manch.  These places experienced flooding over recent years.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to a cost of &euro;70 million per year.  I am referring to a solidarity levy shared by the approximately 2 million homes which were enumerated in the 2011 census.  That would mean, at the most, between &euro;30 and &euro;35 per annum being contributed by each household as a solidarity tax.  I do not believe it would require anything approaching the figure of &euro;700 million to &euro;800 million that has been paid out over the last ten years.  When divided by ten, that figure is approximately &euro;70 million per year.  The figure I have in mind is &euro;20 per household, and I believe people would contribute it.  That would create a sufficiently strong fund.  However, leadership is required.  I call on the Government to get together with the industry.  This has been done in the United States and there is no reason that it cannot work here.  We just need the will to achieve it.<\/p><p>  The representatives of the 98% of people who have flood insurance are fortunate enough not to be as anxious about this issue as those of us who represent the other 2%.  The 2% is a tiny minority, but they are people.  They live in houses that cannot be sold, they cannot move to other areas, they cannot upgrade or downgrade and they cannot get a mortgage because the banks will not give them one.  These are real issues for real people about their homes.

Indeed, I am familiar with similar experience in other parts of the country, including in my constituency.  Other Deputies will have experience of this also.  It is real problem for people.  The insurance system in place is essentially commercially based.  People's properties are covered on the basis of an assessment of risk carried out on commercial principles.<\/p><p>  Anybody would have sympathy with the point made by the Deputy in respect of people who cannot obtain cover.  As to whether there would be a basis for going outside those commercial parameters through the State stepping in by way of a solidarity levy or otherwise, it is an interesting and compelling proposal.  There has been much debate in the Houses about the property tax.  I am not trying to say the two are the same but the question of solidarity, whether it is intergenerational solidarity in the area of health care or solidarity between people who live in different parts of the country and have different risks associated with their properties depending on the climate or where they live, is a good point and an interesting political question we might consider.  On the issue of the insurance regime, however, I regret the answer is not very different from the answer given previously.  Insurance cover for property is done in the commercial environment and I cannot really add more than what I have already said about the State's role in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200035#HH00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","time":1358879100,"counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200035#HH00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1358879100,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Deputy Daly's Topical Issue matter fits in quite well mine.  He talked about a local issue, the appalling flooding that many of his constituents have had to face, which is an aspect of climate change.  That is the issue I am raising in terms of the need for Ireland to lead European efforts to halt the melting of the Arctic ice cap as part of our Presidency of the European Council.<\/p><p>  Many people smiled on hearing about the Topical Issue matter I intended to raise and thought it quite amusing.  However, the single issue that trumps all our economic problems in importance is climate change.  We ignore this issue at our peril.  The melting of the Arctic ice cap is a glaring example of this.<\/p><p>According to Steve Connor, science editor of the London <i>Independent<\/i>, writing on 28 August last year, the area of the Arctic Ocean covered by sea ice fell to 4.1 million sq. km. in the summer of 2012, which was a record low and 70,000 sq. km. below the previous record set in September 2007.  These figures were compiled by the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado.  On 16 September last, the Arctic Ocean ice pack collapsed to its lowest level in thousands of years.<\/p><p><br \/> Why does this matter and why should we care?  First, if the melting of Arctic ice continues, the enormous amount of methane gas locked under the Arctic Ocean and in sub-Arctic regions such as Siberia will be released and, as methane gas is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2<\/sub>, we will be in danger of runaway, catastrophic, irreversible climate change.  Second, the Arctic ice cap acts as a mirror, reflecting some of the sun's rays back into space, and if the Arctic cap is gone, then there will be no reflection and that will add to the heating up of our world.  Third, an obvious knock-on effect is if the Greenland ice sheet were to melt, then sea levels could rise substantially and this would put our coastal communities, such as those referred to by Deputy Jim Daly, at even greater risk.  Fourth, in Ireland last year ,we experienced significant flooding events and the signs are that happens because when temperatures are higher, more moisture gets into the atmosphere, which will lead to greater rainfall in our case and more flooding.<\/p><p><br \/> As we currently hold the EU Presidency, we could set a good example by reaffirming our national goals for dealing with climate change.  We need to take action to further reduce our emissions of harmful greenhouse gases as quickly as possible through investing in renewable clean and green technology industries such as wind, wave and solar energy production.  The same applies at EU level.  If we do it right, we can become world leaders in terms of renewable resource technology and can become a shining example to the rest of Europe and the world that despite the economic storm which we have endured, we took the right decisions.  A report commissioned by the German Ministry of the Environment in 2011 suggested that the EU should try to reduce CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions to 30% below the 1990 levels, and suggested that an additional 6 million jobs could be rolled out in Europe to deliver on this.  I urge the Minister of State and her senior Minister to promote this agenda to the maximum extent while we hold the EU Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200035#HH00400","speaker":"1011","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358879700,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this  important issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  As the Deputy said, this debate highlights the key role that Ireland can play during its Presidency in advancing action at EU level to address the global challenge of climate change.  The melting of polar ice caps is only one of a large number of impacts arising from climate change but it can have far-reaching consequences in the context of rising sea levels and shifting weather patterns.  We all need to take action urgently if we are to get back on a pathway to meet the internationally agreed goal of keeping the global temperature increase below 2&deg; Celsius.<\/p><p>The findings in the United Nations environment programme's latest emissions gap report are stark.  Greenhouse gas emissions levels are approximately 14% above where they need to be in 2020.  Instead of declining, greenhouse gases are increasing more rapidly than in previous projections.  Even if the most ambitious level of pledges and commitments now on the table were implemented by all countries, we would still fall well short of where we need to be by 2020.<\/p><p>  Ireland is determined to drive the climate agenda forward during our Presidency by progressing a number of key initiatives at EU level, including the finalisation of new legislation in relation to reducing CO2 emissions from cars and vans, and holding political discussions and reaching conclusions on a new EU climate adaptation strategy.  The EU cannot address this issue alone, however, as it emits only approximately 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions and it needs to encourage and lead other parties both in the developed world and among developing nations to take early and effective action.<\/p><p>  This shows clearly the importance of the negotiations taking place under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC.  The latest round of those negotiations, held in Doha last November and December, was difficult but, ultimately, successful.  The Doha outcome advances work towards the 2015 global agreement that will tie all 195 parties to the UNFCCC, both developed and developing countries, to a single legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, a number of parties joined the EU in a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, which is welcome.  However, all of the second commitment period parties together account for only approximately 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, it is critical we turn our focus to making progress on delivering the new agreement and on increasing our mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 period to keep the 2&deg; Celsius goal within reach.<\/p><p>  Doha was about building on the 2011 Durban agreement.  We acknowledge substantial work is required during 2013 and 2014, and in our role as EU President, Ireland will have a pivotal role in advancing these negotiations and resolving outstanding issues over the next six months.  It is our intention, therefore, to build on firm decisions and timeframes agreed in Doha by facilitating further work and engagement on key elements which will be discussed at the inter-sessional meetings of the UNFCCC in Bonn in April and June.  It is also envisaged that Ministers will discuss a number of important climate issues at the informal Council of Environment Ministers to be held in Dublin in April.  In preparation for our leadership role, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government held discussions with most of his counterpart environment and climate Ministers across the EU and also held extensive bilateral meetings with key countries during the Doha COP.  We will build on these engagements during our EU Presidency to progress the international climate agenda.  I again thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Ireland intends to use its Presidency to lead in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1358879700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

This Bill allows Ireland to ratify the changes to the Greek loan facility required to implement the new programme of assistance for Greece as agreed by the Eurogroup finance Ministers in December last year.  In order for the enhanced assistance provided under these amendments to the Greek loan facility to be made available to Greece as quickly as possible, all eurozone member states have been asked to complete their national procedures by early next month. The Bill is therefore being treated as urgent, with all stages in the D&aacute;il being taken this week, and all stages in the Seanad scheduled for next week.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the Bill is, first, to further facilitate, in the public interest, the financial stability of the European Union and the safeguarding of the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.  Essentially, the amendment agreement is required to facilitate implementation of changes to the Greek loan facility approved by the euro area finance Ministers in December 2012, subject to national ratification procedures.  These measures are the lengthening of the term of the loan to a maximum of 30 years, and a further reduction in the margin to 50 basis points.  The second purpose is to provide that subsequent amendments to the Greek loan facility agreement can be approved by a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann pursuant to Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution, subject to certain conditions.<\/p><p>  This is the third amendment to the Greek loan facility, so the House is by now familiar with its terms.  However, I will give a brief outline of the development of this facility before addressing the changes covered by this Bill.  As is widely known, for the last number of years Greece has been experiencing serious budgetary and economic problems and remains unable to secure international funding at sustainable rates.  In order to safeguard the financial stability of the EU and the euro area, intergovernmental agreement was reached in May 2010 to provide a programme of financial assistance to Greece.  This resulted in the provision of bilateral loans totalling &euro;80 billion to Greece by the euro area member states along with IMF assistance of &euro;30 billion over a three year period to mid-2013.  The Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010 ratified Ireland's participation in the agreement.  Ireland loaned a gross amount of just above &euro;347 million to Greece under this facility.  When we entered our own programme of assistance in late 2010, we stepped out of the Greek loan facility.  However, as Ireland is an original signatory to the Greek loan facility, our consent is required to implement any amendments to it.<\/p><p>  Two previous amendments have been made to the Greek loan facility that required amendment of the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010.  These were dealt with under the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011 and the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2012.  The Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended, must now be further amended before Ireland can confirm acceptance of the third amendment to the Greek loan facility.<\/p><p>  In June 2011, euro area finance Ministers agreed to amend the Greek loan facility.  These changes provided for the extension of the maturity period for loans from five to ten years, a change in the calculation of the margin on loans to Greece to give it a lower interest rate, and the extension of the grace period between drawdown and commencement of repayment from three to 4.5 years.  Ireland ratified this first amendment to the Greek loan facility through the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011 and our agreement to the amendment was confirmed with effect from 23 September 2011.  It soon became evident that these amendments were insufficient and a need for further measures was recognised.<\/p><p>  On 20 February 2012, Eurogroup finance Ministers approved a programme of assistance for Greece, including the second amendment to the Greek loan facility.  This amendment included three key elements: a further extension of the grace period, of up to ten years, for paying back the loan principal; a further lengthening of the loan maturity to a minimum of 15 years; and a further reduction in the margin to 150 basis points to apply from the three month interest period that ended on 15 June 2011.  These amendments were ratified by the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2012.<\/p><p>  Greece's problems have, however, continued, and its financial position remains a major cause for concern.  In late 2012 it was agreed that additional measures would be required to assist Greece to meet its commitments under its programme of financial assistance.  The measures agreed for this latest set of changes include a debt buyback of bonds held by private investors; a reduction of 100 basis points in the interest rate margin on the Greek loan facility, bringing it to 50 basis points - I would note here that other programme countries, such as Ireland, are not required to participate in this reduction while they are in receipt of financial assistance; the guarantee commitment fee on European financial stability facility, EFSF, loans to be cancelled; the maximum maturities of the loan to Greece to be extended by 15 years to 30 years; interest payments on EFSF loans to be deferred for ten years; and member states to pass on to Greece's segregated account an amount equivalent to the income on the securities market programme portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013.  Again, member states under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance.<\/p><p>  All signatories to the Greek loan facility agreement have been requested to notify acceptance of the third amendment by 10 February 2013.  This is to ensure the next phase of the Greek loan facility can proceed as planned from that date.  It has been necessary therefore to bring forward the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2013 as a matter of urgency to ensure Ireland can confirm acceptance by that date.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note that, as before, the new concessions to Greece will accrue in a phased manner and are conditional upon a strong implementation of the agreed reform measures in the programme period as well as in the post-programme surveillance period.  Given this package of measures, particularly the extension of the loan maturities, it is likely that Greece will be subject to troika review for decades to come.  In Ireland, on the other hand, we are currently preparing to exit our programme.  Both Greece and the other euro area member states agree that it is only through the full and strict implementation of the fiscal consolidation and structural reform measures included in its programme that Greece will regain competitiveness and will be able to fund itself through the international markets.<\/p><p>  As I have already mentioned, the Bill also contains provision for subsequent amendments to the Greek loan facility agreement to be approved by a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann pursuant to Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, subject to certain conditions.<\/p><p>This is the third time that the Oireachtas has been asked to approve amendments to this legislation since it was enacted in May 2010.  Since amendments to its terms are becoming more common, the Bill provides a mechanism to amend the Greek loan facility which will be recognised by way of primary legislation in the Bill and may be recognised as binding the State in the future by way of D&aacute;il resolution made under Article 29.5.2&deg; by amending the definition of that agreement to include such amendment as approved by positive resolution under Article 29.5.2&deg; with a motion published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.  This is similar to the approach taken in the Development Banks Act 2005.<\/p><p><br \/> It would appear to the Government to be more appropriate to provide for the ratification of technical amendments agreed to the Greek loan facility by way of resolution rather than through continued amendment of the legislation.  This will apply to variances of terms and conditions such as interest rates, margins, maturity periods and grace periods.  Changes to the Greek loan facility which require substantive changes to primary legislation or to substantive Irish law, including any proposal to raise the amount to be spent by non-voted expenditure, will still require new primary legislation.  The inclusion of the provision to allow for certain future changes to the Greek loan facility agreement to be agreed by resolution of the D&aacute;il is not to be taken as indicating any particular expectation of further changes.  It merely facilitates a more efficient means of giving effect to certain types of future such changes if they were to arise.<\/p><p><br \/> Some will ask why Ireland is not seeking or being offered the Greek package, or one similar to it.  I would respond by strongly emphasising that it is important to differentiate between Ireland and Greece.  Ireland's situation differs in fundamental aspects to that of Greece.  Therefore, one would want to approach the issues in a fundamentally different manner.  In terms of fiscal and economic performance, there are several key differentiating factors.  Greece's public debt prospects are of a different order of magnitude to Ireland's.  Notwithstanding significant private sector involvement in March 2012, in its autumn forecast the European Commission still projected the Greek debt to GDP ratio to reach 188.4% at the end of 2013.  This, combined with the worse than expected recession, prompted a reconsideration of Greece's debt sustainability.  Even after the recent debt swap and taking account of the impact of structural reforms in raising both growth and revenue over the coming years, the IMF still expects Greek public sector debt to remain above 124% by 2020.  The corresponding Department of Finance forecast for Ireland's public debt, published in last December's budget  is for it to peak at 121% in 2013 and begin to decline thereafter.<\/p><p><br \/> The Greek economy is still in the throes of a recession that is more severe than anticipated.  The troika expects Greek GDP to have contracted by 6% in 2012.  Greek GDP has been contracting since 2008 and is expected to shrink by another 4.25% in 2013.  By contrast, the Department of Finance estimates that GDP grew by 0.9% in Ireland last year and it is projected to increase by 1.5 % this year, with average annual growth of 2.7% forecast for the period 2014 to 2015.  In Ireland's case, therefore, economic growth is helping to ensure debt sustainability.  In Greece, the economy is shrinking and this is compounding the problem of an unsustainable debt burden.<\/p><p><br \/> A critical difference between the two economies in this regard relates to the importance of international trade.  In Greece, exports amount to the equivalent of about 25% of GDP.  This means that export growth is not in a position to provide much by way of offset to the contractionary effect of fiscal austerity.  In Ireland, by contrast, exports amount to the equivalent of more than 100% of GDP which means that the growth of exports can provide a powerful offset to the impact of fiscal consolidation on economic activity.  It therefore follows that what is appropriate for Greece is not necessarily appropriate for Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/> Ireland's route back to economic stability and financial sovereignty is different, shorter and less severe than that of Greece.  That is not to play down the pain being experienced by many in this country, but this is not a case of one size fits all.  Each programme is tailored to the economic factors at play in the relevant member state.  In this context, in terms of the economic challenges facing Ireland and Greece and the best way to deal with them, Ireland's needs as a country exiting a programme are very different from those of Greece.  We are, however, examining the Greek package to see if aspects of it offer any possible benefit to Ireland, particularly in the context of our programme exit.<\/p><p><br \/> The Bill provides for amendments to the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended by the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011 and the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2012.  The Bill has four sections with the amendment of December 2012 to the loan facility agreement set out in the Schedule.  The first section provides the definitions to the legislation.  The second section provides for the third amendment to the Greek loan facility, dated December 2012, to be included in the references to the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended by the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011 and the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2012.  The second section also provides that subsequent amendments to the Greek loan facility agreement may be approved by a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, pursuant to Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution, to be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.  The third section provides for the third amendment to the loan facility agreement of December 2012 to be inserted as Schedule 4 to European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.  The fourth section provides that the Act may be cited as the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2013.  The Schedule contains the text of the amendment to the &#8364;80 billion loan facility agreement dated 19 December 2012.<\/p><p><br \/> This amending legislation includes the two elements I have outlined: the lengthening of the term of the loan to a maximum of 30 years and a reduction in the margin to 50 basis points.  When we entered our EU-IMF programme we stepped out of the Greek loan facility.  Before that happened, Ireland had provided a gross amount of &#8364;347.44 million to the Greek loan facility in 2010.  Greece in fact received a net sum &#8364;345.7 million from Ireland as 50 basis points in commission was deducted from the gross amount.  Quarterly interest payments are being made by Greece on the gross amount.  The 100 basis point reduction in the interest rate provided for in this set of amendments will apply once Ireland is no longer in receipt of financial assistance under a programme.  When it does take effect, it is estimated that the interest we receive will fall by &#8364;3 million per annum to &#8364;6 million per annum.  In addition, the extension of the maturity will extend the timeframe for repayment of the moneys advanced.<\/p><p><br \/> I look forward to a constructive debate on this Bill.  It is essential that all eurozone countries answer the calls made on them to help the currency zone achieve renewed and sustainable financial stability fully and promptly.  This Bill represents Ireland's latest contribution to this unquestionably desirable cause, and we must play our full part.  Therefore, I would urge Deputies to agree to ratify the changes to the Greek loan facility.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200037#KK00600","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358880900,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's opening statement on the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support this legislation but I want to lay down a marker that I am dissatisfied with section 2 and what the Minister of State is proposing, that any future changes to the Greek loan facility will not require primary legislation to be put before this House and will instead be approved by way of D&aacute;il resolution.<\/p><p>Not only have we given approximately &euro;350 million to Greece as part of its bailout arrangement, but it is also an important benchmark for Ireland in terms of any changes to its agreement with our European partners.  I believe that any such changes should require a full debate in this House and the best way to do that is, as we are doing at present, by having a full legislative debate in respect of any change to the Greek loan facility.<\/p><p> It was very much in Ireland's interests that a successful conclusion to the recent round of Greek talks was reached.  A disorderly default in Greece would have dire consequences for all eurozone countries and the contagion effect would certainly have caused a sharp rise in Irish bond yields.  It is the case that there has been a general fall in bond yields among peripheral nations, not least in Ireland, and this has been beneficial for Europe as a whole.  However, despite the more benign backdrop in recent times, my party does not believe in any sense that the eurozone crisis is resolved.  Last year Citibank rated the prospects of Greece leaving the euro at 90%.  Following the actions of the new ECB president, Mr. Mario Draghi, and his pledge to do whatever is necessary to preserve the eurozone, together with the measures agreed in November for Greece, Citibank now estimates the likelihood of a Greek exit to be approximately 60%.<\/p><p> The measures that are being provided for Greece, namely an extension of its loans from the European financial stability facility, EFSF, a ten-year deferral of interest and an extension of the maturity on both the Greek loan facility and the EFSF loans, will help it to some extent.  Greece will benefit from having almost &euro;53 billion of its debt at a lower interest rate and to be repaid over a much longer period of time.  However, it is far from certain whether Greece will be able to stabilise its debt by 2020 as is intended.<\/p><p> The Greek economy is still experiencing negative growth and further painful fiscal adjustment lies ahead for the country and its people.  In fact, it is still the case that their situation can still be described as little short of desperate.  By 2014, their economy will be approximately one quarter smaller than it was in 2007.  This represents a significant decline in living standards and is unleashing considerable hardship on its citizens.  I welcome the fact that Greece's deficit is coming down, albeit slowly.  It is expected to be approximately 7% in 2012.  It will still be a considerable task to get it to the 3% Maastricht target.  It is welcome that the Greek Government expects to run a primary surplus in 2013 which means the easing of the interest burden will be particularly helpful to it.  However, the scale of the crisis facing Greece can be seen from its unemployment levels.  The unemployment rate in Greece was 26.8% in October 2012, four times what it was in 2008.  It is the youth unemployment figures in Greece that are truly frightening.  The number aged between 15 and 24 out of work rose to 57% in October last, compared with 22% in the same month four years ago.<\/p><p> Questions must still be asked as to whether Greece has the capacity to deliver consistently on its pledges, particularly tax increases, improved tax collection, spending cuts, privatisation targets, structural reforms to the economy, public sector redundancies, and wage and pension cuts.  I have heard it argued that European policymakers are setting dangerous precedents by granting further assistance to countries which fail to deliver on their programme commitments.  However, the threat to the eurozone is so grave that cutting Greece adrift at this stage was not a viable option.<\/p><p> Apart from tourism, Greece has few sources of foreign earnings.  It has a tiny export sector and few multinationals.  The country was to a large extent closed to the outside world until its relatively recent return to democracy.  Undoubtedly, the reputational damage it has inflicted on itself has put off some overseas investors.  When we debated the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill last year, I argued that Greece needed more than merely more loans and cheap loans over extended periods.  Its situation was reaching the point where it needed something akin to the Marshall aid plan which the United States extended to Europe after the Second World War.  It is worth remembering that Ireland itself got investment under this plan of approximately $130 million.  If Greece is not assisted to develop a sustainable industrial base capable of generating foreign earnings for itself then there is every reason to believe that in time we will be back debating a fourth, fifth or even sixth amendment to the terms of its loans.  My view is that the European Investment Bank, EIB, should have a much expanded role to play in this regard.<\/p><p> In addition, Greece must tackle its woefully inadequate tax collection mechanism if it is to make a long-term recovery.  In 2012, only 88 major taxpayers, including corporations, were the subject of full-scope audits, well below a target of 300.  In addition, only 467 audits of high-wealth individuals were completed, compared with a goal of 1,300.  In the run-up to our own budget, I was sharply critical of cuts to resources within Revenue.  I pointed out that this was self-defeating and counterproductive, but none the less we are fortunate that Revenue has a strong record in identifying and tackling tax evasion.  By contrast, a report for the troika concluded that in Greece necessary &quot;changes have not yet been reflected in results in terms of improved tax inspection and collection&quot;.  The report went on to state that the failure to pursue tax evaders aggressively is deepening social tensions.  Interestingly, it suggested that, in terms of a crackdown on tax evasion, doctors and lawyers are a good place to start.<\/p><p> As is often said, Ireland is not Greece.  In Ireland, a banking crisis precipitated a crisis in the public finances.  This was made worse by a collapse in the employment intensive construction industry.  Unfortunately, we now know that for years, in the case of Greece, public spending was deliberately understated.  The basis on which it entered monetary union was highly questionable.  In hindsight, it should probably never have joined the single currency at all as it was unprepared for the disciplines which inevitably come with being part of a single currency area.<\/p><p> While this sticking plaster will buy some time for Greece, we still need to confront the fact that the EU is embroiled in the most serious crisis since the launch of the project in the 1950s.  In fact, while this week France and Germany celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Elys&eacute;e treaty, the agreement that became the basis for their close co-operation on building an integrated European Union, it is very much the case that the crisis remains existential.<\/p><p> Four years on, Europe still has not put in place an agreed framework for winding down bust banks and ensuring all costs do not fall on the taxpayer.  It is inexplicable that it has taken so long for European institutions to recognise that design flaws in the original eurozone project precipitated a banking crisis which in several countries, including our own, turned into a fully fledged fiscal crisis.<\/p><p> It is my view that the eurozone project now needs two sets of policy actions.  The first is a redesign of monetary union taking account of the original design flaws and prescribing remedial action.  The second is decisive action to assist economic recovery in the economically distressed countries, including both Greece and Ireland.  In terms of the first requirement, a Europe-wide bank rescue fund is a necessary part of the solution.  However, bank bondholders must bear the risk of loss also.  Since the Minister for Finance's trip to Washington in summer 2011, that is effectively off the agenda for the few remaining unsecured unguaranteed bondholders in IBRC, but it should not be the case in the future.  It is also my view that to mitigate the risk of further financial upheaval, bank deposits in all eurozone countries must be seen as equally secure.  This means putting in place a Europe-wide deposit insurance scheme.  I do not believe progress has been made to date in this regard.<\/p><p> A number of other items also need to be put in place, for instance, the formalising of the ECB's role in supervising banks.  This needs to be a hands-on rather than a hands-off arrangement.  In addition, its role as a lender of last resort should be formalised.  While Mr. Mario Draghi has stated the EU will do everything necessary to preserve the euro, the exact range of measures the ECB has at its disposal need to be formally prescribed.  Finally, the risk associated with emergency lending must be shared among all member states.  This is not currently the case.<\/p><p> In addition to all these measures, to ensure the architecture of the currency union is fit for purpose we cannot separate this from the need for a comprehensive response to the difficulties of the bailout countries of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and, more recently, Cyprus.  It is timely, therefore, that we are having this debate today, given the developments overnight in respect of Ireland's and Portugal's loans from the EFSF and the European financial stabilisation mechanism, EFSM.<\/p><p>We need to ask the question could and should Ireland get a similar deal and if it would be enough?<\/p><p><br \/> The June 2012 summit committed the EU to &quot;examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme&quot;.  There were essentially three ways in which this could be done: changes to the terms of the promissory notes; relief in respect of the continuing banks by means of the ESM taking stakes in the Irish banks; and changing the terms of the EU-IMF programme in a manner similar to the November 2012 Greek deal.  By no stretch of the imagination could last night's discussions be considered a comprehensive solution or even a significant part of one.  In fact all we got was a very small step in the right direction.  However, it will only make a modest difference to our debt profile and the apparent absence of any interest deferral element means there is no immediate cash-flow benefit to the State.  The torturous negotiations in respect of the promissory note need to be concluded in an expeditious manner and there is still no meaningful progress on a deal on the ESM taking a stake in the pillar banks.<\/p><p><br \/> From the very beginning of Ireland's programme, the IMF has been more flexible and innovative in proposing solutions to increase the chances of the Irish programme succeeding.  We need to pay close attention the words of its most recent report that it will be difficult for Ireland to be able to borrow in the markets on a sustainable basis without further help from its EU partners.  The report stated: &quot;Given Ireland's high public and private debt levels and uncertain growth prospects, inadequate or delayed delivery on these commitments poses a significant risk that recently started market access could be curtailed, potentially hindering an exit from official financing at end 2013&quot;.<\/p><p><br \/> Consideration also needs to be given to the &#8364;3 billion to &#8364;5 billion in profits on which the ECB is sitting in respect of its holdings of Irish Government bonds.  In the case of Greece, the ECB committed to repatriating these profits to the country and we should make a similar case now.  The public want to see a real benefit to them from any measures that are agreed.  Last night's tentative agreement will not change the reality of property tax, and cuts to child benefit and respite care, introduced in the recent budget.<\/p><p><br \/> A real game changer would be a deal that frees up resources for investment in job-supporting initiatives.  To date that has not been forthcoming and the Government urgently needs to press the case for it.  The time has passed whereby sticking plasters whether it be for Greece or Ireland will suffice.  There have been more than 20 crisis summits since 2008 yet most countries will remain mired in an economic slump this year.  One aspect of the solution has to be for Germany to examine its own economic strategy.<\/p><p><br \/> Last week the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Mariano Rajoy, made some prescient comments to the <i>Financial Times<\/i>.  He was sharply critical of the one-size-fits-all fiscal policies which are leading to contraction in the eurozone overall.  This is making it particularly difficult for countries such as Spain and indeed Ireland to bring about an export-led recovery while at the same time bringing down their deficits.  Despite weak growth, Germany was still able to run a modest budget surplus last year.  Incredibly further austerity measures are in the pipeline for Germany this year.<\/p><p><br \/> The domestic challenge of private and public sector deleveraging has meant that domestic demand continues to be weak.  In these circumstances the only way for GDP to grow is from net exports.  Ireland has been successful in this regard but the whole process would be made considerably easier if different policies were adopted in economies such as Germany.  When we talk about game changers we need to keep in mind that rather than just tinkering with our bailout terms a much more comprehensive response to the crisis on a pan-European level is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200038#LL00200","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358882100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.

Today marks another attempt at resuscitation of a bad policy by tweaking it.  The austerity regime being heaped on the Greek people should be allowed to die.  When things do not work in politics we should stop doing them.  It is important that we are having this debate today after last night's meeting of the Eurogroup and today's meeting of ECOFIN.  Last June we were told the Eurogroup had decided to separate banking and sovereign debt.  We were told that this week's meeting on Monday would be about finalising the details of how the ESM would capitalise banks and how to deal with legacy debt.  However, we find ourselves in the same situation as we were this time last year.  They have tweaked our plan when in reality fundamental review is needed.  It needs actual progress on recouping the taxpayers' money that was pumped into the pillar banks and a write-down of the Anglo Irish Bank debt which should never have been the people's debt.<\/p><p>  What the people have been saying to me and, I am sure, to Government Members, is that they have had enough of the tweaking and spin.  Those suffering most from austerity will be no better off tomorrow or even next year as a result of what the Government secured last night or as a result of its spin this morning.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case the need for a change is as clear as day.  Austerity has meant a steady decrease in employment, a stagnant economy and forced emigration of its young, amounting to nearly 250,000 people since 2010.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case the troika must stop resisting reality.  We need real deals, including a capital write-down on the promissory notes.<\/p><p>  It is not enough to shift the burden to another generation by extending the repayment period.  A deal on promissory notes must lead to a real reduction on our debt-GDP ratio.  More critically - this is the litmus test of any deal - it must shift the burden away from the taxpayers and citizens who did not create the debt.  The &euro;28 billion outstanding on the promissory note needs to be paid back to the State.  The promissory note should be torn up and should not be paid out.  Any deal which does not reflect that is one that will disappoint me and the vast majority of people.<\/p><p>  On our legacy debt and the debt we have injected into the pillar banks, &euro;24 million, the remainder of the promissory note, people hope that this week's meetings of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN would bring us closer to the day when working citizens are no longer paying off the bankers' debt.  However, based on the announcements last night and today, those hopes seem to have been dashed once again.  There appears to be hardening of opinion on just how special Ireland is.  The opposition of the triple-A Eurogroup countries to any deal on retrospective debt being recapitalised seems as resolute as ever.  The comments this week from the Finnish Prime Minister who said that the old bank debts of Irish banks are, above all, a problem of the Irish Government is a worrying indication that the opposition of Germany, Finland and the Netherlands to a sustainable deal has not budged.<\/p><p>  I have made this call numerous times and I repeat it now: the Government needs to up its game.  After nearly two years of negotiations on this issue of banking debt, little if anything has been achieved.  We have not got back one cent of the &euro;64 billion that was pumped into or committed to the banks.  Concrete and beneficial results are overdue.  The commitment to consider extending the maturities of our EFSF loans and potentially our EFSM loans if it comes to pass is a small step in the right direction.<\/p><p>However, it is not the crux of what we need.  What we need is a genuine resolution and not window dressing or Government spin.  As in the case of Greece, the EU is now admitting its plan for Ireland was not good enough.  This is a failure not alone of the EU but of those who sit around the table at the Eurogroup and ECOFIN, including our Minister for Finance and other Ministers for Finance across Europe, whose heads were stuck so far into the sands of austerity they could not see the reality that the Greek plan would never work and that the Irish plan too was flawed.  <\/p><p> We were told that Ireland is not like Greece, that we would pay our way, meet our targets and would live happily ever after.  However, this was never going to happen.  This reality has finally been accepted.  What we are witnessing is the beginning of a restructuring for Ireland, which is a start.  It is long overdue.  It is unfortunate this was only extracted after painful years of forcing the plan to work.  The Government needs to seize this opportunity and put the ball in the back of the net.  It is almost a year since the EU announced the separation of banking and sovereign debt yet the Government still has not run with the ball or been able to deal with this issue effectively.  In the intervening period, different countries have started to take a more hard lined position.  <\/p><p> We are now entering a critical period.  If the Government stands up for Ireland it can achieve a real deal on restructuring that will be immediate and long term.  It is naive to believe that the markets will not turn against Ireland if it does not receive a fair hand on the promissory note and the issue of legacy debt because the markets have factored this in.  The Government should, as mentioned by the Minister of State in his speech, examine the Greek amendment in detail.  Last November, Greece secured two essential things which the Irish Government has to date failed to secure, namely, a reduction in the interest rate and an interest holiday.  These are key requirements.  Neither seems to be on the table, which is a failure of the Government and its banking strategy.  <\/p><p> Despite the assertion of the Minister for Finance last night that billions of euro will be saved, it appears, when one cuts away all of the spin, that during the term of office of this Government - which I expect will run to December 2015 - not a single cent will be saved by the Irish State or taxpayer based on what was announced last night.  On waking this morning many people heard the spin that progress had been made on Ireland's debt deal.  Listening to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, people would have thought millions of euro would be saved.  The only potential for any savings, unless we get an interest holiday or interest reduction, neither of which appear to be on the cards, will be our not having to roll over these debts when they mature.  Some of our loans from the EFSF are of 29 years duration.  The term of one loan is 25 years and others are for shorter periods.  The first time we could potentially save any money, without securing an interest holiday or interest reduction, will be in December 2015.<\/p><p> It is important to be up-front and frank with people.  What people want to know when they hear progress has been made on the debt deal is if we will get back the &euro;24 billion paid into the pillar banks or, at least, as much as possible of it.  They want to know that when their taxes, including VAT and excise duties, will not end up in Anglo Irish Bank to pay off bankers' debt.  They want to know if the impact on them today or next week, in terms of the austerity burden which they have been carrying, will be eased somehow by these pronouncements by our Minister for Finance as he emerges from the Eurogroup meeting.  It is clear, when one cuts through all of the bull and studies the detail of what was announced, that without an interest reduction or interest holiday, which I understand are not yet on the table, there will be no savings whatsoever by this State until 2016 at the earliest.<\/p><p> I am on the record as saying last November when the Greek deal was announced that there were parts of the Greek deal which Ireland needed to examine and achieve.  I also said that on its own this deal was insufficient as it would not reduce the overall burden of Greece and kept the foot of austerity firmly pressed on the Greek people.  I still believe that.  The events of this week are indicative of Ireland's failure to grasp the opportunity to, like Greece, secure a reduction in interest rates and an interest holiday.  The argument that Ireland is not Greece and should not, therefore, be looking for the same benefits does not hold water.  Some Ministers would like the people to believe that if we got the same preferential treatment as Greece, in terms of an interest holiday or interest reduction, we would, when we wake up in the morning, be able to speak Greek, which is not the case.  Obviously if we got the same deal as Greece we would not have the debt to GDP ratio - 186% - of Greece but it would benefit us and leave us confident of being able to exit the programme we are in.  <\/p><p> Ireland is unique.  We expect fair play across Europe.  There are positives in this Bill in terms of the interest rate reduction, extension of maturity and the interest holiday, which I welcome.  It is clear that this was forced upon European leaders and that this was not done in solidarity to help the Greek people.  It is also clear this came about as a result of the potential Greek exit and the realisation that Europe's plan, of which our Minister for Finance was part and which set targets of 120% of debt to GDP, was simply unrealisable, leaving Europe having to stick another plaster on the sore which is the Greek problem.  Unfortunately, this will not go far enough and this will be proven correct after the passage of time.<\/p><p> While the extension of the period over which Greece can repay its loans and reduction in the interest rate is a pragmatic step, it is not being taken by choice by the EU or the troika rather, it is being forced upon them.  What we should be trying to do is lift the weight of austerity off the Greek working people.  Anything that would do so should be commended.  What we really need is a reversal of the EU's total reliance on austerity as a solution to the ills whether those ills manifest themselves in Greece, Portugal, Germany or Ireland.  Fundamentally, this new agreement is not about helping the Greek people.  It is, once more, about protecting the system.  It is not worthy of our support because it does not offer solidarity to the people of Greece.  It recommits us - this is important - as a contributing country to forcing a bad economic policy on a country whose sovereignty and democratic institutions are not being recognised as they should be.<\/p><p> Let us be clear.  What we are being asked to support is no let-up on the cuts being imposed on Greece.  Every positive aspect of this deal is conditional on Greece continuing to cut wages and slash services.  This is no great gesture of magnanimity or solidarity.  It is a pragmatic admission that the programme designed by Europe was unrealistic to begin with.  It is a sticking plaster on a gaping wound, and in terms of how it will improve the lives of the unemployed or vulnerable in Greece, it means a slightly less painful experience over a longer period.<\/p><p> We do not have the right to tell Greece that it must cut wages and essential public services.  The EU cannot be absolved from responsibility for the Greek crisis.  The broad macro-economic policies of the EU and the ECB contributed to the crash in the Greek economy.  This is most definitely not a simple case of the EU riding to the rescue.<\/p><p>The man on the streets of Athens or the working family in a rural area are not responsible for the destruction of their country's economy.  We must be honest in accepting it is not a purely unselfish act by the EU to include Ireland in committing to Greece.  Greece is a part of Europe and it deserves our solidarity not our condescension.<\/p><p> I also note the Bill means no discussion will take place in the House with regard to future legislation if an adjustment to Greece&rsquo;s programme emerges.  This begs the obvious question as to how many more adjustments the EU and troika think will be necessary.  They seem to be preparing for the long haul, and they are right because there is no way Greece will be able to meet the targets set for it.  It points to a refusal to accept reality for as long as possible, and this has been a trait of Europe.  It pretends the problem does not exist, sticks its head in the sand and does as little as possible for as long as possible.<\/p><p> For years, I, Sinn F&eacute;in and other commentators have pointed out the obvious, that Greece&rsquo;s programme set for it by Europe was unsustainable, would not work, was cobbled together in an attempt to shore up market confidence, and has completely failed.  The legislation before us is an example of the fact that it has failed time and time again.  The adjustments before us today will do to nothing to boost growth or employment in Greece and nobody even claims they will.  It is baffling how many times the EU can talk about growth and jobs and then implement policies which kill off any hope of achieving either.  Unfortunately, this is the same approach taken by our Government also.<\/p><p> Once more the troika has put its faith in austerity as a policy.  On occasion, the IMF has wobbled on this, but when push comes to shove it backs austerity over growth every time.  We are now years into the euro crisis and growth and jobs are as elusive as ever.  Starting at the top and working at every level on the way down, a change in direction is sorely needed.  A change in direction means investment and stimulus at EU level and nationally in member states.<\/p><p> Today's debate has been punctured with figures and references to meeting targets and setting new ones, and it would be easy to forget in all of this that we are speaking about people and their future.  Immediately we hold in our power today the ability at least to try to stop potentially another 30 years of austerity being forced onto the Greek nation.  A total of 50% of young Greeks are unemployed.  The anti-social and arbitrary nature of austerity has led many into the vicious arms of fascism.  More generally, as a Parliament elected by the people we have the power to bring about policies which promote growth and job creation at home and, through our Presidency, throughout the EU.  Unfortunately, the Government, the troika and its masters shown no interest in taking this route.<\/p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il surrendered our sovereignty and this shame is its to carry.  There comes a point when the Government must stand on its own record.  To get back to targets, when we will see a target to reduce unemployment and when will we see it reached?  When will we see a target set and met to reduce the number of children living in poverty in this country?  Are we content that 23% of households are in mortgage distress as we tick the boxes our masters have set for us?  Are we happy to rely on immigration and a generation with massive levels of unemployment to pay off the debts of future generations?<\/p><p> I have welcomed some of the positive aspects of the Bill for the people of Greece.  However, on balance the deal must be seen as another attempt to force an unsustainable way of dealing with the Greek situation into a box into which it simply will not fit.  Reality dictates that Greece needs a write-down on its EU loans like Ireland needs a write-down on its promissory note.  Kicking this can down the road serves no purpose and directly leads to the misery of working people.  Yesterday's announcement, as I stated earlier, was a small step forward but what we really need is the Government to keep its eye on the big prize.  It needs to take the giant leaps forward.  The big steps are obvious.  We must make a write-down on the promissory note a reality, not a sleight of hand like we had last year.  We need to recoup the &euro;24 billion pumped into the pillar banks of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  These demands should be put forward not only by Sinn F&eacute;in or me; they should be put forward in a forceful way by the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and every Minister.  They say these are not optional extras but necessities on which the Government must deliver if we are to return to sustainable growth and ease the burden of austerity which is bearing down, and has borne down, so hard on people throughout the State.  We should be under no illusion that there are big steps to be taken by the Government.  The key question is whether the Government has the ability and willingness to take these steps.<\/p><p> I have said time and again that I wish the Government well in its negotiations in Europe on Ireland's debt.  However, I cannot stand here in all honesty and subscribe to the type of spin which comes from the Government as it emerges from European meetings.  We need the Government to do the serious job being left to it and deal with the burden passed to it from the previous Government which made those reckless decisions.  It is not about extending maturities or saving billions of euro at some time in the future, if these billions even materialise.  It is about the here and now, the people up the long lanes, those considering going to Australia, Canada or London, and those who cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel and want a reprieve now.  The Government needs to start to demand this.  It needs to up its game.<\/p><p> We need a deal on the debt now and not in three years or four years time.  People cannot take any more of this.  Unfortunately, we need to learn the lessons from Greece with regard to writing down debt.  Our country has spiralled in the past.  We can look at targets in terms of growth and exports, but I look at real people.  I sit in their living rooms and speak to them.  I hear what they have to say.  As a spokesperson on finance I deal with facts and figures and official reports, but nothing can tell a story better than hearing it - I was going to say &quot;from the horse's mouth&quot; but we have had enough horse jokes in recent times - from the individuals themselves.  This country lost its way in the past decade as a result of bad policy, but it has also lost its way in trying to resolve and untangle this.<\/p><p>The Government has made serious mistakes, and some of the mistakes being made now are creating problems for a future generation.  It is time to step up to the mark.  It is all right to be on the front page of a magazine accepting awards and being able to spin that this is hugely beneficial, but people on the street know how to measure these things and they want to see real progress and not spin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200040#NN00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358883300,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Education (Welfare) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1358883900,"counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200043#QQ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1358883900,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p><b><\/b>The Bill before the House, which will be debated this evening and tomorrow, sets out to amend the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 to enshrine in legislation obligatory anti-bullying policies that must be implemented on a mandatory basis by school boards of management so there are enhanced procedures in place to deal with bullying whenever it occurs at school.  In order to inform the debate, it is important to list in some detail what this Bill sets out to achieve.  If adopted, the amendment to the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 will provide for binding, mandatory measures to be imposed on the boards of management of schools to ensure that the welfare of a child is adequately safeguarded concerning all forms of bullying that may occur within a school.<\/p><p><br \/>  Section 2 offers an updated definition of bullying and includes reference to cyberbullying and some of the vulnerable at risk groups that often find themselves the target of bullying.  Section 3 amends the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 by introducing a new section in which the onus of responsibility is placed upon the board of management, and the elected officers of that board, to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy in every recognised school.  Section 3 also lists the procedures to which a board of management must adhere when a complaint is made by a pupil or their parent or legal guardian, or when a member of staff knows of a pupil or other person within the school who is being bullied.  This new section also provides parents or legal guardians with the security of knowing the exact measures being taken by the board of management in relation to the individual case.  It also ensures that regular and accurate communication is kept between the officer and the parent or guardian by enshrining into law set timeframes which must be adhered to.<\/p><p><br \/>  Section 4 introduces a new requirement on the Minister for Education and Skills to introduce regulations based on existing guidelines, which will have the effect of giving those guidelines legal status in their current form.  The Minister will also be obliged to review those newly introduced regulations every two years.  This Bill, therefore, introduces a legislative framework that should be implemented in conjunction with a whole-school approach to bullying, which is underpinned by strategic interventions at a school management level.<\/p><p><br \/>  I readily accept that the legislation we have published is by no means the finished article.  There is plenty of scope to refine and improve its content.  I want to place on record, however, that this is a genuine attempt to implement progressive legislation that, if enacted, will protect pupils and teaching staff in schools across this State.  There can be little argument that legislation in this area is long overdue.  For 20 years, successive governments have failed adequately to address this issue and it is simply unacceptable that the existing guidelines to help schools deal with bullying date back to 1993 and have no proper legal standing.  The current procedures in place to deal with bullying in a school setting are at best an <i>ad hoc<\/i> solution to what is a complex issue that manifests itself in many different ways. <\/p><p><br \/>  In 1993, school boards of management were handed the responsibility of preventing and countering school bullying, with no additional time or resources being allocated.  This was an ineffective response to bullying which unfairly burdened boards of management with a role they were ill-equipped to fulfil.  The situation has been further compounded by the failure of Government to legislate properly to allow schools to have a clearly defined set of procedures in place to help teachers and management deal with this issue in a thorough and professional manner.  We also need to provide a clear definition of bullying that reflects the changed nature of society in the last 20 years, by recognising the various forms it can take as well as the motivations that influence this type of behaviour.<\/p><p><br \/>  Bullying is a complex and difficult issue that can manifest itself in many different ways.  It can leave long-lasting physical and mental scars on its victims.  At worst, the physical and psychological damage to an individual can, as we have sadly seen in recent months, be a significant factor that leads to self-harm and-or death by suicide.  In recent months, the media have highlighted the awful tragedy of teenage suicides associated with bullying, which is clearly the worst possible scenario.  Far more common, however, is depression associated with bullying, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, eating disorders and deliberate self-harm that all too often lead to truancy, absenteeism, early school leaving and, in some cases, individuals being forced to change schools. <\/p><p><br \/>  The implications for teaching staff who find themselves victims of bullying can be just as profound.  Stress related illnesses arising from bullying prevent many teachers from functioning properly, leading to enforced time off work as well as disillusionment and frustration in the workplace.  All of this takes a considerable emotional toll on the child, teenager and teacher concerned.  In turn, it has wider implications for the extended family circle and society in general.  In many cases, there is also a direct financial cost to the State in terms of medical interventions and having to provide substitute cover for teachers out on sick leave as a result of the emotional distress caused by bullying.<\/p><p><br \/>  As legislators, we need to do more than pay lip service to what is happening in our schools because words alone are meaningless without having in place the type of robust safeguards that protect the well-being of children and staff in a school environment.  This is something on which we can all agree.  We have only to examine the international best practice of other countries where they have applied evidence-based strategies in response to bullying in schools and the workplace to understand the importance of legislative reform.   When considering this Bill, we should also strive to achieve a co-ordinated approach to implement reforming policies on an all-Ireland basis because bullying is as relevant an issue north of the Border as it is here in the Twenty-six Counties.<\/p><p><br \/>  I cannot overstate how important it is that we learn from the anti-bullying measures and procedures that have been implemented in other countries.  Norway, for example, is a country with similar demographics and population to Ireland.  It is recognised as being a world leader by the way in which it has dealt with this issue.  A key to that country&#8217;s success has been to ensure that, from the outset, up-to-date and effective anti-bullying policies have been in place.  Such policies are underpinned by legal reforms made in the Norwegian education act of 2003.  By adopting this type of strategic approach to the problem, experts such as Professor Erling Roland have concluded that the enhanced efforts made in Norway have led to decreased incidence of bullying behaviour in schools.  In short, those efforts have had tangible and meaningful benefits to the health and well-being of children, young people and teachers.  It is something we should seek to emulate.<\/p><p><br \/>  Closer to home, having a mandatory anti-bullying policy in the Six Counties since 2003 has helped to ensure greater co-operation between relevant groups and people with expertise in this area, so that a more coherent strategy has been central to the efforts to address bullying in schools.  This has been a significant step forward which has helped to improve matters in that part of the island.  It surely makes a great deal of sense to expand this type of initiative and have both jurisdictions working together towards a common goal, on an all-Ireland basis, with clearly defined outcomes.  It is difficult to imagine why a school in Newry must have an anti-bullying policy based on legislation, while a school in Cork does not.<\/p><p><br \/>  In a broader context, legislation to tackle bullying is important in establishing a healthy and positive school ethos.  The UN Declaration on the Rights of the Child, to which Ireland is a signatory, states that children have a right to feel safe at school.  This begs the question of how this is possible if bullying is not addressed effectively.<\/p><p>This of course opens a broader debate that must be considered because there is a good deal of evidence to show that young people learn what they see and experience in schools, as well as what is formally taught to them.  Schools should be places of mutual respect and dignity, where people feel safe and free to achieve their potential as citizens.<\/p><p><br \/> When I discussed this Bill with various stakeholders, the response has been positive in most cases but some concerns have been expressed regarding implementing legislation on bullying, one of which was it may over-burden teachers and boards of management at a time when there is a scarcity of resources.  While I acknowledge the genuinely-held concerns of those individuals and groups, especially when so many important front-line education services have been cut over successive budgets, I believe the opposite to be the case.  I believe having in place clear and precise procedures and regulations will greatly benefit teaching staff and boards of management, as well as the children under their care.  This is because, as most professionals working in this field will confirm, when there is confusion or a lack of clarity with regard to a school&#8217;s procedures for anti-bullying action, more time is wasted by students and staff as they attempt to deal with an incident whenever it occurs.  This lack of clarity in the absence of clearly defined procedures ultimately results in a greater likelihood of conflict and anguish developing between the victims of bullying and their families on one side and school authorities on the other side, which can often make a difficult situation a good deal worse.  Additionally, there also is the adverse emotional consequences for the target of the bullying and his or her family because of the delay in dealing with an incident and the unnecessary stress this can cause.  The intention of this Bill therefore, is not to over-burden schools, boards, principals and teachers but rather is to help them in their work by providing the necessary clarity<i><\/i>that is so important when dealing with such a complex and difficult issue.<\/p><p><br \/> One of the significant flaws in relying solely on the 1993 guidelines is they were drafted before the advent of the Internet and the social media which have, for all their undoubted benefits, provided a new and highly invasive way for those who bully to target their victims.  Within this Bill, we have attempted to define the various types of bullying because it is extremely important to be clear on what is meant by bullying and cyberbullying.  We are now at a position where the older members of the &quot;always on&quot;, &quot;digital native&quot; population are in the senior cycle of second-level education.  It is inappropriate to expect schools to be guided solely by a document drawn up in 1993.  Members must update and extend their consideration to include the technological advances that have developed subsequently.  The question as to whether cyberbullying can push a young person too far is moot, as recent media reports have shown this to be the case.  My party also has attempted to define other at-risk groups to protect the targeting of people because of their sexuality or identification as a member of an alternative subculture, such as goths, punks, skaters and so on.  The fundamental ethos underpinning this Bill is the safeguarding of children and assisting already hard-working principals and teachers in undertaking this important work.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree this is an issue that transcends party politics and is of great importance to every parent and educator in this State.  Should the legal reform at the core of this Bill be implemented, the present Administration and future Governments also will be obliged to continue to introduce measures to resource and assist schools in preventative practice.  That is the reason Sinn F&eacute;in has included a section whereby the Minister for Education and Skills would review the proposed new regulations set out in the Bill on a two-yearly basis.  This week&#8217;s announcement by the Minister that schools will be obliged to keep a formal record of bullying incidents, that patterns of bullying will be tracked and schools obliged to react, certainly is a welcome if long overdue development.  The announcement of mandatory reporting and plans to circulate a report template is a step in the right direction and has been linked to a similar successful procedure in Sweden.  It also is a constituent part of the school&#8217;s anti-bullying plan in the Norwegian Zero programme, which, like the home-grown programme in this State known as the Erris Anti-Bullying Initiative, has a far wider-reaching set of resources and procedures.  I therefore call on the Government and Opposition parties to support this Bill which, if enacted, will provide a legal framework to ensure there are clearly-defined procedures in place to help teachers and school boards of management better manage the issue of bullying in schools.<\/p><p><br \/> I will conclude by quoting Nelson Mandela, who, in his foreword to the World Health Organization&#8217;s World Report on Violence and Health of 2002 stated:<blockquote>Violent cultures can be turned round. ... Governments, communities and individuals can make a difference. ... We owe our children &#8211; the most vulnerable citizens in society &#8211; a life free from violence and fear. ... We must address the roots of violence. Only then will we transform the past ... legacy from a crushing burden into a cautionary lesson.<\/blockquote>The culture of bullying can be turned around.  Members must address the root causes of bullying and only then can they provide children with a life free from violence and fear of bullies.  Members must act now to strengthen the laws in order that schools are better equipped to deal with bullying and in so doing, they will have provided enhanced protection for this and future generations of teachers and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200043#QQ00300","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358884500,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Brien is sharing time.

It is now approximately 432 days since I brought to his attention and that of this House an incident between a then 13-year old child and a principal of a school in Sligo, resulting in the young boy's refusal, since 2009, to go back to school.  I gave the Minister documentary evidence detailing the medical, psychiatric and psychological impact on the child.  I outlined how the child had threatened to run away from home or worse.  I detailed the efforts made by the boy's parents to resolve the issue through contacts with the principal, the school board of management, the National Educational Welfare Board, various offices and officials within the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs and with politicians from all political parties.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, stated in this Chamber on 16 November 2011 that he was concerned about the case detail and would take a personal interest in the matter.  He stated &quot;the amount of time this impasse has existed is simply unacceptable in a democratic republic&quot;.  I took heart from those words and perhaps I was politically naive but when I left the Chamber that night, I was hopeful that he would do something to right this grievous wrong and would introduce policies and the necessary legislation to ensure there could never again be a recurrence of such an incident.  I do not know what happened between the time the Minister left the Chamber on the night of 16 November 2011 and my submission of some follow-up questions, approximately three or four weeks later, but it quickly became apparent that the<i> status quo<\/i> would be maintained, that boards of management would continue to investigate themselves when accused of wrong\u00addoing and that the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills would continue to keep an arm's-length distance between legislators and policy-makers and those who deliver services.  This is not delegation of responsibility but is abrogation of responsibility.<\/p><p><br \/>  In a country and at a time when one can no longer claim ignorance of the damage done by unregulated institutions, how can Members, with any credibility, continue to perpetuate an education structure in which boards of management are self-regulating, self-controlling, self-accounting, self-investigating and self-reporting?<\/p><p>This Sinn F&eacute;in amending Bill does not seek to overthrow the whole education system.  Nor does it seek to make sweeping changes to the way boards of management work nor to the relationships between boards of management and the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs.  All it seeks to do is provide for binding, mandatory measures to be imposed on the boards of management of each school to ensure that the welfare of a child is adequately safeguarded with regard to all forms of bullying that may occur within a school.  The Bill also places a requirement on the Minister for Education and Skills to introduce legislation to give legal status to existing guidelines, and to review the guidelines every two years to ensure they are being strictly followed in order to ensure the safety and well-being of each pupil in a school in Ireland.<\/p><p> Unless the Minister can demonstrate to me and others within and outside the D&aacute;il that he proposes to quickly propose legislation - not guidelines - to ensure the current legislative and reporting flaws are addressed, he should support this Bill as an honest basis for further discussion and deliberation with all groups.  The child I spoke of in my introduction is now a young man of 16 who remains psychologically damaged.  He continues to be educated at home at the expense of the State and that is because of our failure as legislators to provide him, his parents and others like him with safeguards to ensure his safety and well-being.  He has been denied access to redress when things go wrong, and he, his parents and others like him are being denied justice.  Please let this young man be the last such case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200044#RR00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358885100,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Brien for introducing this important Bill in Private Members' time.  The content of this is based on the proposed Education (Welfare)(Amendment) Bill 2012, and it is a product of long and thorough consultation with the relevant stakeholders.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Education (Welfare) Bill 2000 in order to impose mandatory requirements on boards of management in schools to adopt counter-bullying and preventative measures.  Having served on boards of management, I know how important this will be.<\/p><p>  The Bill introduces a new section in which the onus of responsibility is placed on a board of management and the elected officers of the board to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy in every recognised school.  I use this time to highlight the need to tackle homophobic bullying, and in doing so I pay tribute to BeLongTo, members of which are in the Visitors Gallery tonight.  That group focuses particularly on meeting the needs of young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, young people.<\/p><p>  Why should we focus on homophobic bullying?  It is one of the most widespread forms of bullying in Irish schools according to the report Equality and Power in Schools: Redistribution, Recognition and Representation, by Kathleen Lynch and Ann Lodge.  According to the United Nations World Report on Violence Against Children, most bullying is sexual or gender-based, targeting girls or boys or those who do not fit into the perceived sexual and gender norms.  Consequently, homophobic bullying affects all young people and particularly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people.<\/p><p>  Dr. Stephen Minton, a psychologist at the anti-bullying research and resource centre at Trinity College Dublin, cites Canadian experts indicating that the majority of bullying research fails to address sexual orientation, and although homophobia is a prominent feature of school yard bullying, it is also one of the most unchallenged forms of bullying.  Dr. Minton argues that, in short, as a frequently observed form of prejudice-related bullying, it makes sense at every level to prioritise the addressing of homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>  The Trinity College anti-bullying centre indicates that 16% of all Irish second level students were targets of bullying but in the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students, much higher rates are experienced.  In a major study funded by the HSE entitled Supporting LGBT Lives, it is indicated that 50% of LGBT young people experienced homophobic bullying, with 40% subject to verbal threats from fellow students and 25% physically threatened by peers.  Of most concern is the fact that 34% of young LGBT heard homophobic comments from teachers.<\/p><p>  We must send out a loud and clear message this evening that homophobic bullying is wrong, will not be tolerated and must be stopped.  Urgent measures are needed to address homophobic bullying for four reasons.  Homophobic bullying has been documented as one of the most pervasive forms of bullying in Irish schools.  LGBT young people experience bullying at a much higher rate than other young people and Irish research shows that homophobic bullying is a significant casual factor in self-harm, suicide and other mental health difficulties among LGBT young people.  Significant numbers of Irish teachers have reported that they find homophobia far more difficult to address than other forms of bullying.<\/p><p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill should receive cross-party support as it is in line with Government policy and thinking.  In the 2011 programme for Government, there was a commitment to encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and particularly strategies to combat homophobic bullying and support students.  This was reiterated by the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, when he announced in May 2011 the establishment of a working group comprising all relevant sections of his Department, along with non-governmental organisations involved in this area and the education partners that would help draft a road map to eliminating homophobic bullying in our schools.<\/p><p>  We all want to do the right thing and people are concerned by the issue.  The Government and my party are involved but we are two years into a government term.  As my colleague stated earlier, if the Government is not bringing forward legislation, we urge it to accept this Bill.  I know of cases in my constituency where young people are refusing to return to school.  One girl in the Mountrath area is refusing to return to secondary school because of serious bullying.  Her life and that of her family has been turned upside down and it is having a serious effect on the girl at a critical stage in her life.  She is 14 and it is an important yet vulnerable time in her development.  We urge the Government and its Deputies to support this Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200045#SS00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1358885100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an Bhille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien, and his staff for bringing forward this Bill.  In opposition we are often accused of being critical or condemnatory for its sake alone but this Bill is surely an example of a representative attempting to bring forward a real and positive measure which will deal with a growing problem in our society.  I must also thank Dr. Stephen Minton, an expert in bullying who lent his knowledge to the Bill&rsquo;s formulation.<\/p><p>  The Bill sets out to put a legislative responsibility on the board of management of schools through an elected officer to adopt and implement an &ldquo;anti-bullying policy&rdquo;.  These procedures then must be abided by following a complaint by a pupil or legal guardian, or a teacher who is aware of a problem.  The Minister must also from this Bill introduce regulations based on existing guidelines, making them mandatory.  The Bill will help to combat bullying, giving support to those who are bullied and attention to those who bully and create an environment where pupils can feel protected and safe in their school and throughout their school days.<\/p><p>  We know all too well the cost of allowing the present state of affairs to continue.  Bullying is not an easy issue to deal with.  Its causes are many and symptomatic of a society which breeds carelessness in how we treat others.  However, something can and should be done.<\/p><p>We all know of stories from our local communities of children who have taken their own lives following prolonged periods of bullying.  Such events which are so tragic it is hard to consider them fully occur in every part of the country.  Young, vibrant lives that are full of potential end because bullying was allowed to continue or was not even noticed.  The experiences of the children in question may have been different but one thing is certain - more could and should have been done.  The lesson we must learn from these deaths is that we must ensure more is done in the future.<\/p><p> Children who take their own lives as a result of bullying make up a small proportion of the children who dread going to school every day because of the loneliness they experience and the mistreatment and anger inflicted on them by people who are supposed to be their peers.  School is supposed to be a bastion of knowledge, exploration and excitement where young people learn how to work and play and be the person they will grow into.  It is not meant to be a cold place of fear and anguish or one in which they will, as adults, look back on with anger and pain.<\/p><p> Those who are assembled here are political representatives and activists because we seek to carve out a better world for our children, one in which they will be happy and safe from harm.  This is not an easy task, but this legislation is a step that would help us on our way.  Schools must protect children and never treat bullying as a phase or something to gloss over.<\/p><p> Those who face abuse are often those who are marginalised.  Traveller children face deep discrimination not only in school but also in their daily lives.  My local area has a large number of families from the Traveller community and I know all too well the problems Traveller children face in schools.  Coming from a disadvantaged background with low educational attainment, they are already on the back foot and grow up in a society in which slurs against their people are commonplace.  Bullying is a reality for them every day, as it is for many children from immigrant backgrounds.  The problem is not confined to people from certain backgrounds, however, and crosses all sections of society.  Homophobic and transphobic bullying, for instance, is a form of discriminatory bullying that requires a specific focus and strategy of its own to complement general anti-bullying policy. <\/p><p> The Bill seeks to make action on bullying mandatory.  It would make the Minister responsible for ensuring this took place and empower him or her to enforce a system in which bullying would not be tolerated or ignored.  Experts have been clear that a lack of clarity in procedure and indecision in the face of bullying significantly hamper the resolution of a bullying problem.  Bullying must be broadly but clearly defined in order that no child who needs help is placed outside this definition and that there is no equivocation about whether bullying is taking place.  Deputies from across the political divide have met families who have encountered bullying and must introduce measures to prevent it.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200045#SS00300","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358885700,"counter":420,"content":"<p>As my party's spokesperson on health and children, I urge Deputies on all sides, Government and Opposition, to support the Bill in the name of my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.<\/p><p><br \/>  Awareness of the extent of bullying in society has greatly increased in recent times.  We are also more aware and knowledgeable about the effects of bullying on victims.  As well as making the lives of children in school a misery, bullying can have seriously detrimental long-term effects on their mental and physical health and well-being in later life.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last October the Oireachtas cross-party group on mental health, of which I am a co-convenor, organised a briefing for Oireachtas Members on bullying and mental health.  It was addressed by Dr. Stephen Minton of the anti-bullying centre in the school of education at Trinity College Dublin who is also the co\u00adauthor of <i>Cyber-Bullying: The Irish Experience, <\/i>Dr. Tony Bates of Headstrong, the national centre for youth mental health, and Ms Rose Conway Walsh of Erris, County Mayo, whose community development project is developing a youth mental health and well-being support structure for the county.  The briefing was most informative and confirmed the critical importance of youth mental health.  A key point is that resilience is best developed in the early years of a person's life.  Moreover, the skills children develop at a young age will help them to cope better as adults.  This applies to children's and young people's mental health in general but is especially relevant in the context of bullying.  It is as important to equip children to respond to bullying or the threat of bullying as it is to seek to eliminate bullying in so far as that is possible, especially in schools.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last year Headstrong published the &quot;My World Survey&quot; of more than 4,300 young people aged between 12 and 25 years, the most in-depth survey of the mental health and well-being of adolescents and young adults in the State.  The survey was wide-ranging and among the key questions asked were some on respondents' experiences of bullying.  More than 40% of the young people surveyed reported that they had been bullied at some point.  Of these, 30% reported that the bullying had occurred in the past year, 14% in the past month, 4% on a weekly basis and 3% on a daily basis.  With regard to where adolescents were most frequently bullied, 77% indicated in school, 5% over the Internet or by text - 2% and 3%, respectively - 5% at home and 13% elsewhere.  Nearly half of females reported that they had been bullied compared to 40% of males.<\/p><p><br \/>  School is clearly the main site where bullying is being experienced and endured by young people.  Even accounting for a crossover between the figures for school, on the one hand, and the Internet and text messages, on the other, the figure for bullying by electronic means seems relatively small, especially given the publicity this form of bullying receives.  However, we must also take into account the fact that for those who experience the most intense and persistent forms of harassment and intimidation, bullying by text and on the Internet is extremely distressing, making it seem that, even at home, the victim does not have a safe refuge.  Consequently, we have seen terrible tragedies, with young people who are victims of this form of bullying being pushed to the extreme of taking their own lives.<\/p><p><br \/>  Among the key themes in the survey, the following are relevant in the context of bullying: one good adult is important to the mental health of young people; not talking about problems is linked with suicidal behaviour; those who share their problems enjoy better mental health; and many young people in distress are not seeking help.  Parents and schools need to encourage and facilitate children and adolescents to step forward and speak out if they are experiencing problems and feeling distress, irrespective of the level at which it occurs.  It is also crucial that leadership is given by schools.  In that context, if there is any hint that speaking out is in any way discouraged or made difficult or if there is any prospect that a school would try to minimise, ignore or conceal the reality of bullying, the victims are condemned to silent misery and the culprits facilitated.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Bill is both a health and an education measure.  The health of individual young people is greatly impaired by the experience of bullying.  Their education is thwarted and a school where bullying is ignored or not properly addressed cannot be a fit place in which to educate children.  Only a few short months ago the people endorsed in a referendum an amendment to the Constitution explicitly recognising for the first time the rights of children.  For this amendment to have meaning, we must see its expression in terms of both legislation and practical measures to vindicate the rights of children.  The Bill is such a measure, providing as it would a basis in law for practical action in every school to combat bullying.  I urge the Government to accept the Bill, facilitate its passage, improve it, as required, and implement it, thus enhancing the rights, health and well-being of all children.  In opposing it, as it has indicated it intends to do, the Government is again kicking the can down the road, which will result in untold misery and tragic consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200046#TT00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1358886300,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister of State is sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200047#UU00100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1358886300,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Yes, with Deputies Paul J.

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on bullying and I would like to apologise on the Minister, Deputy Quinn's behalf for his unavoidable lack of availability for this debate.<\/p><p>  We all know that bullying can ruin a young person's enjoyment of some of the most important years of his or her life.  In extreme situations, it can also tragically be a factor in a young person taking his or her own life.  Given the severe consequences that bullying can have, it is important that, as a society, we take every opportunity to raise awareness about this issue and send a clear message that no form or type of bullying is acceptable anywhere at any time.<\/p><p>  The specific commitment in the programme for Government to help schools tackle bullying, particularly homophobic bullying, underlines this Government's commitment to addressing the issue.  It was with this in mind that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, along with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, convened a forum on anti-bullying on 17 May last year.  Remarkably, this was the first time that the Department of Education and Skills, together with the newly established Department of Children and Youth Affairs, had hosted a dedicated forum on this issue.<\/p><p>  The event, which coincided with International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, provided an opportunity to bring together a range of stakeholders to consider what changes to existing policies and practices in schools might be necessary to tackle bullying effectively.  We also wanted to identify practical steps and recommendations that could be taken to improve how schools approached and tackled bullying.<\/p><p>  A wide range of expertise and experiences were shared on the day and more than 100 stakeholders attended, including experts in the field of bullying, support groups for victims of bullying, representatives from the schools sector and NGOs, such as the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and BeLonG To Youth Services, whose presence this evening has been acknowledged.<\/p><p>  The range of perspectives and ideas presented on the day demonstrated that this is a complex and challenging issue, one to which there is no quick fix.  There are many facets to bullying behaviour.  For example, modern technology is constantly providing new and more pervasive mechanisms that can further enable this type of unacceptable behaviour.  The use of technology can enable bullying to take place at any time of the night or day and can often mean that the child or young person's home is no longer a safe haven, as the Members opposite outlined.<\/p><p>  Alongside the forum, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, established a working group to consider how best to tackle all forms and types of bullying in schools.  On the day of the forum, he issued a call for submissions from all interested parties and stakeholders.  He invited students, teachers, parents and all other interested parties to submit their views on this topic so that the working group could take full account of all of the issues and viewpoints involved.  It is a measure of the concern about bullying that 67 submissions have been received from the education partners, representative groups, experts and individuals.  The working group has considered these submissions, along with the outcomes and recommendations from the forum.<\/p><p>  During the past few months, the group has also been consulting with a range of stakeholders as well as with colleagues in Scotland and England.  The group has finalised an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken to tackle bullying in schools effectively.  I am happy to announce in the Chamber that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, will launch the action plan later this week.<\/p><p>  The group's work has confirmed that a key element in preventing bullying in schools is the presence of a positive, inclusive school culture where everyone in the school community understands what bullying is and its impact on those involved.  Effective strategies for preventing and tackling bullying are based on a whole-school community approach.  Research shows that anti-bullying policies and practices work best where the entire school community, including school management authorities, staff, students and parents, play their part and are resolute in maintaining a climate of respect for all.  It is clear that the curriculum is an important tool in helping children and young people to develop positive attitudes and in allowing them to develop their knowledge, understanding and respect for diversity, as well as strategies to protect themselves from bullying.<\/p><p>  Instilling respect for diversity in our children and young people is also a major issuing in tackling prejudiced-based bullying, including homophobic bullying.  Unfortunately, research tells us that homophobic bullying is widespread in schools.  Research also shows that LGBT young people are at a higher risk of bullying and that this form of bullying is one of the least challenged in our schools.  For this reason, there is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to address the serious issue of homophobic bullying in our schools.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman for Children published a report on bullying late last year.  The report is based on consultations with more than 300 children and young people from the ages of ten years to 17 years.  It provides a helpful insight into how young people believe bullying should be addressed.  It emphasises the view that children and young people should be involved in the development of their schools' anti-bullying policies.  Such policies should be written in language and formats that are appropriate to students' ages and abilities and also in ways that are interesting and engaging so that children will pay attention to the messages and information being communicated to them.<\/p><p>  The Bill before the House is flawed for a number of reasons, notwithstanding the good intentions of its proponents and sponsors.  The approach taken whereby one individual is tasked with responsibility for implementation of the school bullying measures is entirely inconsistent with international and national best practice relating to the prevention of and intervention in bullying incidents in schools.  It is widely accepted that a whole-school and community-based approach is essential to underpinning effective counter-bullying measures in schools.<\/p><p>  The Bill places a significant and impossible reliance on just one individual member of the school board of management, who would be legally solely responsible for a range of functions, including the overall implementation of the school's anti-bullying procedures.  This is contrary to the principle of corporate governance to which all boards of management are required to adhere and to the significant body of research that says that all members of the school community must be involved and responsible for dealing with bullying in schools.  There is also a grave and genuine risk that placing legal responsibility solely on one person in this way might be seen as absolving other members of the board, staff and school community from dealing with this critical issue, even where the best intentions attend on such a measure.  Schools must have appropriate intervention strategies in place to respond to incidents of bullying.  Having one member of the board of management responsible for this does not and will not underpin a whole-school community approach.<\/p><p>  The requirements of the Bill to hold a board meeting and notify parents within days of each reported incident is also unworkable and potentially counter-productive.  The consequence of such a requirement would be considerable bureaucracy, at the very least, involving multiple board meetings - weekly or perhaps even daily - a significant amount of paperwork and the potential for legal challenge in the event that the stringent requirements were not adequately met.<\/p><p>  We do not want schools to become so focused on meeting legal requirements and timelines that the real focus of addressing the bullying incident or behaviour in an effective and appropriate manner is actually diminished.  For the same reason, the Government is not in favour of the reporting requirements suggested by the Deputy in this Bill.<\/p><p>Any attempt to implement these proposals in their current form would cause unnecessary difficulties in schools and would be unworkable.  They could also be counter-productive.  The mandatory reporting to parents suggested by the Deputy might also cause particular difficulties for some young people.  I refer in particular to young people subjected to homophobic bullying.  Young people who are, or are perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, LGBT, may not feel comfortable discussing their sexuality with their parents and may not wish the perceived reasons for bullying to be made known in that way.<\/p><p> If a young person feels that his or her family might not be supportive, regrettably, he or she might feel particularly vulnerable if the school is required to report the circumstances of bullying to the parents.  That particular risk has been acknowledged for instance in the state of Massachusetts, where mandatory reporting was introduced as part of a legislative response in 2010.  Specific guidance was issued by authorities there on notifying parents when students are bullied based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.  In addition, research shows that it is most important in responding to incidents of bullying that the child or young person affected is consulted and is involved in devising an appropriate response.<\/p><p> Turning to the issue of the national guidelines on bullying policies, there is widespread agreement that the Department's guidelines on countering bullying in schools must be updated.  Deputy O'Brien raised the issue, which I accept is a fair point.  While the guidelines can be adapted by schools to meet their particular needs and most of the content remains valid, the fact that they were issued in 1993 means that their revision is long overdue.  The definition of bullying must be updated.  I am aware that the working group is making recommendations in that regard.<\/p><p> A number of interdepartmental initiatives are in train which are related to bullying and must be considered in revising the bullying guidelines.  That includes the development of the Emotional Health and Well-being: Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools, which the Minister, Deputy Quinn, intends to publish in the near future.  As Deputy O'Brien correctly stated, nor do the existing guidelines make any reference to cyberbullying, given that they were produced in 1993.  While the guidelines themselves require to be revisited, and will be, it does not follow and the Minister does not support the provision in Deputy O'Brien's Bill to turn the existing guidelines into regulations at this time.  That would not be appropriate.  It would be preferable to focus our energies on updating the existing guidelines in consultation with the education partners.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Brien might also note, that while statutory underpinning of the current guidelines is somewhat indirect, there is nevertheless some statutory support and endorsement for them.  All schools are required, under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, to have a code of behaviour which has been drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB.  The NEWB guidelines make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment, and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  Legislation is already in place to ensure that schools have anti-bullying policies.  We must now proceed to update the Department's anti-bullying guidelines to make sure they fully meet the needs of modern schools, and provide up-to-date guidance for schools on how best to develop and implement anti-bullying policies and procedures at individual school level.<\/p><p> I also wish to highlight the fact that this is not just a school problem: although it does exist in schools, it is not confined to the school environment.  Not all bullying behaviour takes place in the physical school environment itself.  Bullying behaviour can occur wherever children and young people gather, including in the home, as Deputies have pointed out, and in wider family and social groups such as youth clubs and during sporting and recreational activities.<\/p><p> It is clear that parents and wider society have an important role to play in preventing and tackling bullying.  The bullying behaviour that is taking place in schools, and the prejudices that underpin some of the bullying, is learnt and copied from what children and young people hear and see in their everyday lives.  That includes in the home, in the community and through the media.  Therefore, we all have a responsibility, right across the community, to model the type of respectful behaviour that we would wish to see in children and young people.<\/p><p> It is clear that schools, parents, Government, civil society, industry and children and young people themselves, must play their part in preventing and tackling bullying.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, will launch the action plan on bullying later this week and he will outline his full response to the proposals of the working group at that time.  The Minister looks forward to working with the education partners and other stakeholders to reinvigorate and strengthen the approach to preventing and tackling bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200047#UU00400","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358886900,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As someone who has worked with young people during what is a period of great transition in their lives, I am only too aware of the devastating impact bullying can have on a person's life.  Everyone in this Chamber is aware of the devastation that bullying can wreak in the lives of people of all ages, but young people are particularly vulnerable.  I welcome the Government's determination to take action on bullying.  While the Bill might not be the answer it provides a welcome opportunity to discuss the issue.<\/p><p>  Students in schools are particularly vulnerable to bullying and often feel cornered in a situation where they are made to feel increasingly powerless.  The Government must aim to send a strong signal, through a wide range of initiatives, to anyone contemplating bullying in a school setting that it is a most serious offence and one which will be properly documented and dealt with at the highest level.  School days should be among the happiest times of a person's life and given that the Government requires people to attend school, it behoves us to ensure the school environment is as welcoming as possible for all.  While homophobic bullying is a particular worry, the avenues for bullying have multiplied with the increasing presence of the Internet in all our lives, be it via smartphones, camera phones and a variety of websites that can be used for negative purposes by bullies.  Research demonstrates that young gay people are at a higher risk of bullying and the sad fact remains that homophobic bullying remains under-reported and is one of the least challenged types of bullying in schools.  Cyberbullying has laid waste to the lives of many teenagers, sometimes with particularly tragic consequences.  Education is needed in a variety of settings to ensure that young people are fully aware of when they overstep the line in terms of bullying.  Education on bullying is not just needed in the classroom; all adults must be educated on bullying, and such programmes could benefit many schools, homes and workplaces throughout the country.<\/p><p>  We must remember that many children are coming to school from homes where derogatory comments about gay people and people of a different nationality are commonplace and therefore, education must begin in people's homes and in particular in the homes of school-going children.  Parents must recognise that children will mimic their actions and if their actions are racist or if they indulge in bullying in the home or in cyberbullying, then their children are at risk of being taken to task for the very actions they have learned from their parents.  The adults of tomorrow are learning from the adults of today and if respectful behaviour is what is required in a school setting, that is only made possible if it is demonstrated in a home setting.  The Bill, while reflecting the fact that every Member in the Chamber is committed to tackling bullying, might not be the answer but the best way forward is one which reflects best international practice, which requires that the onus for tackling bullying is spread as widely as possible through all parts of the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200048#VV00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1358887500,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I am happy to contribute briefly to this debate.  I thank Deputy O'Brien and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing it forward.  I am also aware that the Minister will launch his action plan on Thursday, which I welcome.  He and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, have been proactive in this area.  A total of &euro;500,000 in funding has been put in place to implement the action plan.<\/p><p>  As a former secondary school teacher, I have seen many forms of bullying over the years, be it in classrooms, schoolyards, playgrounds and pitches.  It was easier to deal with because it was visible, verbal or physical.  It happened in view of the teacher or supervisor and from that point of view it was easier to nip it in the bud and come to the aid of the student being bullied.  Obviously, we are all grasping with the social media, as has been evident in the last few months, and how to deal with it there, be it on Facebook, Twitter or texting.  It is secret, silent and difficult to detect.  Furthermore, it is a 24 hour per day event in which the victim is persecuted, often silently and with tragic consequences as we are all too aware.  Regardless of whether it is this Bill or the action plan, what we need in the short term is a unified, identifiable and implementable approach to dealing with this, whereby the student or person being bullied is comfortable with accessing help at short notice without fear of recrimination.<\/p><p>  I read the Bill earlier today.  In a school, the big issue is students bullying students.  However, there are other relationships in the classroom and I have often seen instances of students bullying teachers.  That is obviously not the major issue but it is one that must be identified, because it can wreck people's careers as well.  With all these telephones in classrooms there can be consequences for teachers.  I mention that because it is another area to be considered.  This issue is developing so fast it is hard to get ahead of the curve but that is one issue that must be dealt with at some stage.<\/p><p>  There are many organisations that are doing great work for people who feel threatened by bullying by offering counselling.  There are also suicide awareness groups.  However, perhaps there are too many.  Many of them have great qualities but there must be some way to co-ordinate them as well.  When I was preparing for this debate I found out about GRASP Life Foundation, which has a new android telephone app.  Younger people are adept at using social media and perhaps this is something that could be used very positively.  They could get help very quickly if they download this on their telephone.<\/p><p>  These are just a few random thoughts on the issue.  It is a very important issue and I welcome the debate.  Ultimately, we must get to grips with this issue, regardless of whether it is through a Bill or the action plan.  It can be done by working together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200049#WW00100","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1358887500,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Smoking kills, drugs kill and bullying kills.  Cat Cora is right.  She said, \"Bullying is killing our kids.  Being different is killing our kids and the kids who are bullying are dying inside.  We have to save our kids whether they are bullied or they are bullying.  They are all in pain\".<\/p><p>  To the extent that this Bill furthers the debate on bullying, I welcome the Deputy's genuine work.  However, having vast experience as a teacher and principal, I disagree with fundamental elements of it.  The Bill proposes to make one person on a board of management responsible for designing and implementing what is described as counter-measures to bullying.  This is flawed.  It is not in line with national and international best practice and is totally at variance with the whole-school approach.  To counter bullying in a school every member of the board of management, teaching staff and administrative and ancillary staff has a responsibility for the children in the school, not just one member of the board of management.<\/p><p>  My main issue with the proposal is that it is unambitious.  Anti-bullying policies in our schools must be innovative and forward thinking.  The legislation before us falls short, and our children deserve better.  The anti-bullying forum will report this week and &euro;500,000 has been provided to give practical support to schools and teachers.  Existing guidelines in schools are not appropriate and the Minister has promised to address these guidelines in respect of cyber and homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>  Greater responsibility must also be put on parents' shoulders.  As parents, we must stop being so naive.  Children tell innocent white lies all the time.  Some children tell white lies about the amount of homework they have, some tell them about finishing their chores and some will tell them about their on-line activity.  I had the opportunity in the recent past to sit in on an anti-bullying workshop by 60 14 year old pupils.  I have heard students say publicly in their classroom that they visit paedophile sites for fun and because they are bored.  As a former school principal, I advise parents to befriend their children on-line, to be vigilant and to know what their child is doing on-line.  Ignorance is bliss but it can be fatal when it comes to bullying.  Last year, 2012, brought that reality firmly into focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200049#WW00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1358887500,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on bullying.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this Bill and for affording us this opportunity to discuss it.  Much emphasis has been put on cyberbullying, but it is still bullying.  Suggesting getting rid of Facebook, Twitter and the Internet as well as taking mobile telephones off every child and teenager will not change the fact that homophobia existed before Twitter, as did racism and discrimination against Travellers.  We must get to the real issue involved in bullying, which is a lack of self esteem on the part of the bully and those who engage in bullying behaviour, and also define properly what bullying is.  Bullying is not a once-off occasion of a person falling out with another person.  It is a sustained, persistent and negative behaviour, a dominant behaviour of one over another.  Parents must understand that.<\/p><p>  Teachers are generally doing an excellent job in tackling bullying in their classrooms and schools.  As has correctly been said, it is a whole-school approach.  However, children do not live in schools.  Society must understand that.  Often we say &quot;if only the teachers taught them in schools&quot; about whatever the social ill of the day is, but children do not live in the schools.  Parents must understand that teachers can only achieve a limited amount.  Bullying before school, after school and at the weekend is not within the remit of the teacher.  Parents must also accept that if they are confronted with the realisation that their child is engaged in bullying behaviour, they should not take that as an indication of poor parenting.  A child can be bullied, react to that in a particular type of way and turn into a bully or engage in bullying behaviour.  That is not a reflection of bad parenting but sometimes the way these things work out.  In my experience, however, parents often find it very difficult to accept that their children are engaged in bullying behaviour and it is therefore very difficult to tackle it properly.<\/p><p> A number of great initiatives are under way in the school system.  I commend the Irish Traveller Movement on its yellow flag programme, which celebrates diversity, Traveller identity, multiculturalism and sexual identity.  Schools can initiate such programmes.  We do not necessarily need to be overly negative about what it is happening in schools.  Much of what it is happening is positive but we have a culture of humiliation in our society.  There is a drive in media and political circles to humiliate and make somebody feel he or she is worthless.  If that is a societal issue, we have to address it as such.  The Government's proposals, which will be released by the Minister for Education and Skills on Thursday, will be the start of that process but we, as a society, have to reassess how we view people with different identities.<\/p><p> I do not know about blaming the method by which people bully each other.  There have to be tough constraints on how children can access the Internet, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor alluded to, but pupils have anonymously posted comments about other pupils on toilet walls in schools forever.<\/p><p> While I commend Sinn F&eacute;in's attempt to bring this issue to the floor to the House and to open it up for discussion, the Bill has flaws.  I refer to the proposal for the board of management to have one designated person to deal with bullying complaints and to initiate an investigation into such complaints within three days.  That is almost unworkable.  The significant work engaged by the Minister should be acknowledged.<\/p><p> Acknowledging what is bullying is a societal issue and we must face up to it as a society rather than leaving it to teachers and parents.  The school is not the only forum in which bullying needs to be tackled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200049#WW00300","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358888100,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I join previous speakers in commending Sinn F&eacute;in on introducing the Bill and for putting the issue of bullying on the political agenda.  I acknowledge this is happening during the week the Minister will publish revised guidelines to tackle bullying in schools.  It is more than appropriate that he is bringing them forward because they are overdue and much needed.<\/p><p><br \/>  Bullying does not only affect students as they go through the education system; it can be a feature of every stage of our lives.  All of us will be aware of experiences in our own lives where we came across bullying and witnessed it up close.  The difficulty is that schoolchildren are not equipped with the tools to handle it in the way adults can and, because of their vulnerability, there is a requirement on us to ensure we do our utmost to protect and educate them through the policies we implement.  We must do our best to have a population which is aware of the issues surrounding bullying in order that everyone can deal with them and assist in challenging them to ensure we move away from past experiences whereby sufficient attention was not given to bullying.<\/p><p><br \/>  We are considering how the way in which bullying is tackled in our education system can be improved, but the unfortunate reality is bullying always took place in schools and, in too many cases, it involved teachers and students.  I have heard countless stories of people subject to corporal punishment by teachers, although this involved a minority of them.  There were many fantastic teachers but I never cease to be amazed when conversing with people aged in their 60s and 70s by the pain their memories of these experiences as schoolchildren can elicit.  They openly relate their experiences and the indelible mark left on their lives.  It is amazing that many of them turned out as well as they did considering what they experienced on a daily basis.  That is a barbaric and archaic world to us now 40 years later.  That, thankfully, no longer happens and there is a heightened awareness in our society of bullying.<\/p><p><br \/>  The challenges today presented by the methods of bullying are much different and they have changed radically, even in the past decade.  As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said, children have been writing on toilet doors in schools for years.  If children are subject to a traumatic experience, the last thing they want is for that to become widely known and to have to deal with that as well.  Over recent years, social media websites such as Facebook have mushroomed and people have the ability at the click of a button to publicise anything.  Negative experiences for children in school can be magnified by social media and, as a result, rather than just being subject to physical or verbal bullying, which was manageable in the past in the sense that it could be dealt with in school, home or in a sports club because there was supervision, these incidents can be publicised on social media sites and children have to deal with that as well.  As a society, we have been playing catch up, as have other many other societies, in the context of the fast changing nature of public and social communications.  A few months ago, for the first time a communication via Twitter was the subject of a libel case.  Twitter is a common means of communications nowadays but it is only now that the site is becoming subject to the law and that the legal system is getting to grips with its impact.  Schools are only now updating their tools to deal with the vastly greater challenges presented on an ongoing basis by social media.<\/p><p><br \/>  Deputy O'Mahony referred to the bullying of teachers.  At the beginning of the social media age, I can recall a website, <i><i>www.ratemyteacher.ie<\/i><\/i>, which predated Facebook and Bebo.  The site demonstrated the impact social media could have on teachers.  We became aware more quickly of the site because adults were affected but, too often, we do not recognise when children are affected by something like this because they have not developed the skills to deal with bullying.  Children of all ages have fewer peers to whom to reach out because those who are younger than the person affected by the bullying will probably not be in his or her social group while those who are older may have moved on.<\/p><p>A person who is being bullied may have only a confined peer group to reach out to and unless we equip young people to deal with bullying and react to it, we are not dealing with the issue or taking as much action as we can to assist them.<\/p><p> Bullying is linked to self esteem.  Too often it is about being able to fit in.  It takes a courageous adult, and an even more courageous child, to step in and sort out a bullying situation.  Unless we build an environment in which children can become aware of what is going on, bullying will be perpetuated and will not be dealt with.  Apart from teachers, the people who are best able to ensure that bullying does not happen are those people who see it happening, the peer group.  We must equip them with the tools to assist, intervene and stop bullying when they see it taking place.  I hope the guidelines that will be published on Thursday address the issue.  Deputy O'Brien's Bill is timely and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party fully supports it.  The working group should co-ordinate with the Departments of Education and Skills and Health to ensure a joined-up approach to mental health.  <\/p><p> The role of guidance counsellors in issues such as bullying was mentioned more than once in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks.  The career guidance survey which was published last week showed that one-to-one counselling hours have been reduced by 50% compared to last year.  A profession has been built up over a number of years to a strength of 700 guidance counsellors.  These counsellors are trained professionals.  In earlier times, counsellors were untrained or partially trained.  Each of those 700 counsellors is a qualified counsellor as well as a career guidance adviser.  Many of them are now back in the classroom.  In several responses on this issue, the Minister for Education and Skills said we need a whole-school approach to guidance, counselling and dealing with students' well-being, including bullying.  That is absolutely correct.  Everyone must be involved in this issue, including students and teachers at all levels, particularly those who have roles of responsibility.  If a student is having a difficulty, where can his teacher send him for one-to-one counselling sessions?  Someone needs to answer that door when a student knocks on it.  The service needs to be there.  There are only so many hours in the school day.  If the guidance counsellor is expected to teach classes while also dealing with students' counselling needs, a situation could be exacerbated.  Serious consideration must be given to this.  Our guidance counsellors are a valuable resource in our secondary schools.  We must ensure that the training they have built up over many years is put to best use.   <\/p><p> Members received a circular today on the issue of homophobic bullying.  This has been particularly prevalent in schools, as well as in the wider society.  There has been much progress in society's approach to sexuality.  I note the approach of President Obama yesterday in his second inaugural address when he made gay rights a tenet and objective of his second term.  This shows how far we have come on this issue, thankfully.  There is much more work to be done.  The Anti-Bullying Centre in Trinity College Dublin found that 16% of all Irish second level students had been the target of bullying.  Supporting LGBT Lives: A Study of Mental Health and Well-Being, funded by the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, found that among LGBT people 50% had experienced verbal homophobic bullying, 40% had been verbally threatened by fellow students, 25% had been physically threatened by their peers and 34% had heard homophobic comments from their teachers.  This problem is particularly acute.  Young people going through the education system are at a stage where they are coming to terms with their sexuality and are unsure of where they are.  Having to endure negative comments or bullying behaviour can be stressful and have a severe impact on one's mental health.     <\/p><p> Many have advocated that we should restrict social media and access to the Internet.  We can put safeguards in place.  With regard to online bullying, as well as its more traditional forms, we must educate and equip our students to know how to deal with it and to know the impact of their behaviour.  We must resource and equip our teachers and those working in the education sector to support students and educate them.  We must provide health care services.  Too often, when problems are exacerbated students and young people must spend several months waiting to see the professionals whom they need to see immediately.<\/p><p> I look forward to seeing the proposals when they are published on Thursday.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on putting this issue on the agenda and I support the Bill.  I urge the Minister to take note of tonight's debate, consider the Bill and ensure that we take the much needed action to create a safer environment and an education system that best serves our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200050#XX00200","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358888700,"counter":433,"content":"<p>With the permission of the House, I will share my time with Deputy Thomas Pringle.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that Sinn F&eacute;in has used its Private Members' time tonight and tomorrow night to discuss this serious matter.  We know the consequences of bullying.  It is not a recent phenomenon.  Bullying has been with us since time immemorial.  I do not know what it is in the human psyche that gives us this inclination, or need, to hurt a fellow human being. <\/p><p>  There are two important words in the definition of bullying.  They are &quot;repeated&quot; and &quot;intentional&quot;.  It is important not to blur the lines between having a disagreement, a row or a falling out and what is really bullying.  If someone disagrees with me, it does not mean I am being bullied.  The term &quot;bullying&quot; is sometimes applied to situations that are not bullying, as defined.  This takes from the serious nature of bullying. <\/p><p>I have a difficulty with the phrase that it is against someone who is not able to defend himself or herself in that situation.  That is almost to facilitate bullying in certain situations if the recipient can deal with it.  Perhaps there are those who appear to be able to cope, but I have absolutely no doubt bullying affects the recipient.  It might not appear so immediately, but it could emerge in years to come.  Repeated intentional aggression against an individual or group is wrong, regardless of how the recipient deals with it.  The other point is that the behaviour of the bully must be looked at.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the good work being done in schools.  Schools and youth organisations have put a lot of time into drawing up anti-bullying policies.  Procedures have been put in place for dealing with incidents of bullying and there is an array of programmes in schools and youth clubs to make them a safer environment.  I acknowledge the work of the unit in Trinity College Dublin, Kidscape in Britain which has fantastic material available, GLEN and BeLonGTo, the Big Brother and Big Sister programmes, the mentoring and buddy systems, friendship days and weeks and programmes such as On My Own Two Feet and the Cool School.<\/p><p> In my own school there were two principles when we looked at this issue.  We valued difference and it was a telling school.  If we get these concepts across in all situations, we will deal effectively with bullying.  As an English teacher, we used the freedom offered by the junior certificate programme to use poetry and plays on bullying.  It was a great way to get across to teenagers.  There are very few schools that do not take bullying seriously and that do not do what is suggested in the Bill.  Being anti-bullying is a whole school function.  I have a difficulty, however, with a single member of the board of management taking full responsibility for the issue.  Board of management members are volunteers who have an inordinate amount of work to do and they are taking on more and more as time passes.<\/p><p> Young people today do not have the language to express themselves.  That is the first step in tackling bullying because they must be able to describe the feeling of being alienated and isolated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200051#YY00200","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358889300,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Education (Welfare) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  Bullying is an issue that has not been far from the headlines in the past year.  We have seen a number of tragic incidents related to bullying in schools and cyber bullying.  In my day at school, a person who was being bullied could go home and get away from it and did not have to face it at the weekend.  Unfortunately today there is no escape from bullying because of social media, Facebook and Twitter.  It continues outside school which makes it even more difficult to deal with for the person on the receiving end of the bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>  Most schools are proactive on the issue of bullying; it is on the agenda of most schools which have robust policies in place.  In this legislation I would be wary of the role envisaged for the board of management in section 3.  As has been outlined, voluntary boards of management would have a difficult time in dealing with bullying in the manner outlined.  A system under which the principal would outline at regular meetings what was happening in the school in order that the board of management would be fully informed would be a better one and easier to manage for voluntary board members.<\/p><p>  Bullying is no longer being tolerated, but there is a reliance on individuals to ensure policies are implemented within schools.  If the principal is focused on the issue of bullying and being proactive in dealing with it, the school is normally good at dealing with it.  However, we must put a system in place that does not rely on individual principals or members of staff to ensure policies are enacted and implemented as strongly as possible to protect all children.  The bullies must also be worked with to ensure they understand why their behaviour is not appropriate and should not continue.  The Minister is to publish guidelines on bullying, but we should find a system that would not rely on individuals being proactive to ensure their implementation.  As people retire or move on, the policies must continue to the benefit of the whole school environment.<\/p><p>  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in for introducing the Bill which I will support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358889300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358889300,"counter":437,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 January 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
