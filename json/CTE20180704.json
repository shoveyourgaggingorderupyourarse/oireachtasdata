I will start by paraphrasing what President Juncker said in the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago.  If my speech is a bit slurred it is not because I am drunk, it is because I have a problem with my gums, but I would prefer to be drunk.<br\/><br\/>My diplomatic career has lasted almost 40 years but today is the first time I have been invited to address parliamentarians.  That is an honour which I appreciate, but also a challenge to which I will attempt to rise.  I am not sure whether it is still politically correct to quote Woody Allen but he once famously said 90% of success is just showing up, so here I am, and so is my deputy, Ms Stephanie Winckler.  I remember very well the first Austrian Presidency in 1998, just three years after we joined the European Union.  I was then in charge of helping to co-ordinate Austria's participation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  It was all very exciting.  During Austria's second Presidency in 2006, I was ambassador to South Africa, which was demanding but less exciting.  Then came the Lisbon treaty of 2009, which brought a permanent President of the European Council, a High Representative for Foreign Policy and a strengthening of the role of the European Parliament, all of which led to a reduction of the responsibilities and possibilities of the Presidency.  Now we are entering into our third Presidency.<br\/><br\/>Contrary to some of my esteemed colleagues who have appeared here, I do not propose to go into great detail today because I would prefer to listen to the comments of members and, if possible, to try to answer some of their questions.  Austria views her role as Presidency primarily as a mutual broker and attaches great importance to the unity of the European Union.  This applies in particular to the major challenge of concluding the Brexit negotiations, despite the fact that the Presidency has no direct role in them.  It will also be in line with our traditional role as a bridge builder that we will approach the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework post 2020.  This task will not be an easy one, especially since Austria has already declared that we do not want to pay more than we do now.<br\/><br\/>I will now move to our priorities.  We have chosen the motto, A Europe that Protects, for our Presidency, and we want to give substance to this slogan in three areas.  The first is security and the fight against illegal migration, which can only be effective if we act jointly.  At the centre of these efforts are a reform of the common European asylum system, which is certainly not an easy task, and the strengthening of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, with up to 10,000 personnel by 2020 compared with the current strength of 1,500.  We should also work more closely with third countries to provide assistance to those in need of protection before they enter the European Union and in order to ensure effective return policies.  Last week's European Council called for regional disembarkation platforms outside the European Union and four controlled centres inside EU member states.  However, it remains to be seen how that can be achieved.<br\/><br\/>Another complication is the plan by the CDU and CSU parties in Germany to establish so-called transit centres near the border with Austria and to send back those already registered elsewhere or those who are not entitled to asylum.  We are awaiting more clarification from our German colleagues and we will take the matter from there.<br\/><br\/>The second area where we want to give meat or substance to a Europe that protects is securing prosperity and competitiveness - that is a tongue-twister - through digitalisation, which means, <i>inter alia<\/i>, completing the digital Single Market and modernising public administration.<br\/><br\/>Members will not like the next bit, but I have to say it.  The Austrian Presidency will also aim to continue the work on the taxation of the digital economy to ensure that profits are taxed in the country in which they are generated.<br\/><br\/>The third area is stability in the European neighbourhood.  Building on the excellent work of the Bulgarian Presidency and the European Commission's enlargement strategy of February 2018, we will advocate for a concrete EU perspective for all western Balkan or south-eastern European states.<br\/><br\/>Finally, we look forward to the report and recommendations of the task force on subsidiarity, which is supposed to be published in the course of this month, and we plan to hold a high level conference on subsidiarity in November of this year.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018070400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We are familiar with each other from having been on the European circuit over the years.  We have even been known to cross one another's paths on the football circuit from time to time.  All of the times in Europe have been trying times, none more so than the present time.  The issues the ambassador has raised are testing but Brexit is the big one because Europe cannot be the same again after Brexit.  We will never know what it will be like in the future.  We hear people say they want to go back to the good old days.  It is not clear which of the good old days are being referred to but I presume it is the first half of the 20th century.  I am not certain to which part of those good old days we want to go back.   When I say \"we\", some other countries in Europe, not necessarily only the British, have also expressed thoughts along those lines.<\/p> <p>  We in this country are very committed to the European Union.  The most recent opinion poll showed 92% of Irish people were committed to the EU, which is the highest or second highest in the European Union.  The EU is of great importance to smaller countries, which never really emerged from the economic shadows until the European Union became a reality.  The secret of their success is that in the EU they became independent and protected and there were no trade barriers or other barriers.  There are some people in Europe who want closer co-operation and some people who want less co-operation.  My question, in circumstances in which we set out to pursue the views of each individual state on the extent to which they want to be able to determine future policy in Europe, is how we are to get 27 member states to have a uniform opinion.  That is a contradictory and impossible objective.<\/p> <p>  Be that as it may, there are considerable grounds for believing we have been successful.  As the ambassador knows, we have a peace process in Northern Ireland, which continues to be helped by the European Union.  It came at the end of 30 years of guerilla warfare, during which time many thousands of lives were lost and great division occurred on the island of Ireland.  These generally faded away into insignificance as the island became one economic entity.  Taxation operated in terms of a single economy from the point of view of being part of the European Union and no border existed.  This has become a challenge for us insofar as a return to the old days would have a serious and negative economic impact on the country.  This is one of the issues on which Ireland has taken a very strong line with respect to Brexit and will continue to do so.  I compliment the European institutions, Mr. Michel Barnier and all of those involved in the Brexit negotiations on the manner in which they have conducted those negotiations on behalf of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  We have no antipathy towards the United Kingdom.  The UK took the decision to leave the European Union.  Sadly, some of the information made available to British people before they made that decision was inaccurate.  Some of the people who conveyed those inaccuracies to the public had been committed to undermining the European Union during their entire time in the European Parliament.  We are now in a position in which we have to live with whatever decisions are made.  We will make the best of this and continue to make a strong contribution to the European Union and its ideals.<\/p> <p>  I remind people of the vision of Europe held by the founding fathers - Schuman, Adenauer, Monnet and others.  In the Europe they envisaged at that time they saw an alternative to the chaos and destruction of the first 50 years of the 20th century.  They were right and will be proven to be right.  As I said the other day, the European Union was the biggest single peace process the world has ever known.  Some 550 million people are involved in a commitment to each other, to peace and to prosperity.  It is a commitment never known before in the history of Europe.  We have done very well.  The challenge for the future is to continue on the route or path laid down by Europe's founding fathers.  It is up to ourselves.  If we want to nitpick and go back to where we were, we know where that will lead.  History has repeated itself many times and unfortunately will continue to do so.  <\/p> <p>  I hope that, under the guidance of the Austrian Presidency, we will progress and perhaps the UK will have second thoughts.  Perhaps at some stage in the not too distant future the UK will decide Brexit was not a good idea and will revisit the issue.  That would be the best outcome.  The worst outcome would be a harsh Brexit that leads to a trade war in which countries, big and small, and their populations suffer.  Employment would also suffer and economies would suffer to such an extent that it would be patently obvious to all that the decisions made by some people were not in the interests of the people.<\/p> <p>  We keep in mind the need for enlargement of the European Union.  The western Balkans come to mind.  The area has always been one of contention in the past for one reason or another.  We must keep that in mind and we must be supportive of the thrust of European unity for as long as it takes.<\/p> <p>  I was glad the ambassador brought up the issue of digital taxation because I also have a view on it.  I do not disagree with him.  Taxation should occur in the countries in which the profit is made, not in some other country.  I resent that Ireland is deemed to be liable for the collection of taxation for the countries in which the profit was made.  That is a matter for the individual member states.  While it is being approached by the European Union at the moment under the heading of state aid, that is tendentious as far as we are concerned.  The theory that somebody will give us &euro;19 billion or &euro;13 billion of a windfall is grand thinking, but that is as far as it goes.  It is like the Tobin tax.  It is great if everybody does it, but if one country decides on its own to have a capital transaction tax or something like that, nobody will transact any capital in that country if other countries are free of that particular entrapment.  <\/p> <p>  I wish Austria well in the course of its Presidency of the Council.  I hope that the end of this year will see a better outcome for Brexit than appears will be the case at present.  We hope Austria's influence in the centre of Europe will be sufficient to convince all of our colleagues that together we stand and divided we fall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018070400002#H00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1530709200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am terribly sorry that I was not here for the ambassador's presentation.

I note in the ambassador's presentation that he raised migration, which is an issue that interests me and to which I try to refer every time I get an opportunity.  I regard migration as more important and pressing than Brexit because it has the capacity to break our Union and to bring it to its knees in a very short space of time if we do not take it on as a collective.  That means less in the way of barbed wire and borders and more in the way of co-operation as we go forward.  That is not to say that I am advocating an open door policy for anybody who wants to come.  We have to manage what is happening.<\/p><p>We have to take the traffickers out of the equation.  It is wrong in every sense of the word that traffickers can make money out of human misery.<\/p><p>When I went to Sicily we found that 93% of those who had landed could not reasonably have been classified as refugees and should more reasonably have been classified as economic migrants.  Europe has to have a place for economic migrants.  It has to have a place where we can upskill people from Third World countries and send them back home to improve their own economies.  I am not advocating an attack on the human rights of people.  I am advocating that as a Union we recognise our moral responsibilities.  The current plan of having disembarkation stations on the north African coast is doomed before it starts.  I am not sure how we will manage it but the middle of the Mediterranean is not the place.  I have huge issues with where we are going on that.<\/p><p> Allied with the migration issue is the issue of what I would term as soft terrorism.  From my observations in Italy, people arriving at a refugee or migrant station can declare they are anybody they want to be and can adopt an entirely new persona.  They can leave their past and their history behind them.  It is understandable that in some cases that will be the case.  People depart at speed sometimes to save their own lives.  We will have to find a better way of categorising people and establishing some sort of background on where they came from.  It is a serious challenge for the Austrian Presidency of the European Union as we go forward.  To a certain degree, the migration crisis has become slightly more controlled than it was but we still have a long way to go.<\/p><p> I would like to see policies developed or at least commenced under the Austrian Presidency so that we offer training, upskilling and repatriation and encourage the corporate world to invest in these countries.  They are all prepared to invest.  There are several examples in Ireland of footloose companies that pulled out, leaving 1,000 people unemployed in Ireland, and moved to places like China, Morocco and other places where they could get cheap labour.  The polo shirt or pair of runners one buys on the high street is no cheaper as a result of these companies moving to cheaper labour sources.  Clearly, there are supernormal profits being made by these companies.  I note the ambassador's interest in taxation.  I always love when foreign diplomats come here and have great interest in taxation just like we Irish do.  Maybe we should be looking at the corporate world to get some of the taxation from it.<\/p><p> There are many other issues we will have an opportunity to discuss over the next six months but I wish the ambassador well.  Leaving Brexit aside, which we always talk about in this room and I am sure Deputy Durkan has mentioned it many times, and although it is a huge issue, there are other problems that are much deeper and have the capacity to do far more damage.  I wish the ambassador well and I look forward to the policies coming forward.<\/p><p> I am sorry again for being late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018070400002#H00500","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530709200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, I had to vote in the Seanad.

I hope the United Kingdom is not pulling out prematurely from participation in the European Union.  Will the ambassador confirm that?  He might not have the list but I do not see any attendees from the House of Commons or the House of Lords.  It will be very disappointing.  I was hoping to meet our colleagues there.  Maybe the list has not been finalised.  I am not quite sure about it but from the list that was circulated I cannot see the participation of the United Kingdom.  The COSAC meeting is a great opportunity to meet and discuss the future with our colleagues from the United Kingdom even though we are not negotiators.  Mr. Barnier is negotiating on behalf of the European Union and Mr. David Davis is in charge for the United Kingdom.  I am subject to correction.  My view of it was cursory.  It has happened before.  During the previous presidency there were no representatives of the United Kingdom Government there.  I hope it is the case that they have not finalised their numbers yet.  Normally there would be embassy representatives there too.<\/p> <p>  The next six months will be crucial.  There will be a crucial meeting in Chequers on Friday.

After he meets the Taoiseach on Sunday he will travel to the Border on Monday to see the situation there at first hand.  I am sure the Taoiseach will use the opportunity to explain Ireland's position in more detail.  I am sure the Chancellor, in turn, will inform the Taoiseach how he intends to proceed, especially on the tricky issue of migration, and follow up on last week's European Council meeting which addressed the issue of disembarkation platforms.

We will survive Brexit but not all medium-sized countries are in the same boat.  Certainly, the consequences of a hard Brexit would be more severe for people in Ireland than for us in Austria.

I agree with my colleague all European countries, not only front-line countries, must take specific responsibility and try to ensure prosperity is extended outside the borders of Europe in a way that caters for the people who are concerned about their future in their home countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018070400002#K00900","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530709200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I have nothing to add and I completely subscribe to what the Senators said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018070400002#K01000","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We very much appreciate the opportunity to inform the thinking of the committee in preparing its upcoming report.  We strongly welcomed the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which signalled the priority of mental health as an issue across all political parties and provided an opportunity for Ireland&rsquo;s mental health system to be scrutinised at parliamentary level in a new way.  We also support many of the recommendations of the committee&rsquo;s interim reports, in particular those on increasing the proportion of the health budget allocated to mental health, including development funding, the prioritisation of the development of a mental health information technology, IT, system and the expansion of the existing suite of key performance indicators in the mental health services, all of which are relevant to today's discussion.<\/p>  <p>  Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s leading national coalition on mental health, with more than 60 member organisations which campaign together to drive progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  Since 2012, it has actively campaigned for increased funding for mental health services and supports for specialist mental health services and the mental health system as a whole.  In addition, in pre-budget submissions for the past six years it has called on the Government to invest in and ensure the implementation of a national mental health information system.<\/p>  <p>  Investment in mental health services must be understood as a question of resources for staffing because it accounts for 80% of expenditure on mental healthcare.  Investment in public mental health services is about ensuring that the right people are in place and available to provide support to people in mental and emotional distress across the country.  Between 2012 and 2018, &euro;210 million in development funding was allocated to the development of new mental health services.  However, it must be acknowledged that the investment occurred in the context of increasing demand for mental health supports and much of it was spent on areas of service delivery not specified in A Vision for Change.  That does not mean that those are not very important and worthy areas.  The amount invested in our mental health services is calculated based on the cost of implementing A Vision for Change but much of the development funding has gone to supports not specified in that framework, such as the National Office for Suicide Prevention and counselling in primary care.  The funding has also been used to maintain existing levels of service in the face of increased demand, to obtain out-of-area placements for services for which we do not have the appropriate facilities in Ireland and to cover the cost of agency staff who cover unfilled posts.  While the investment is welcome, it has been vastly outstripped by the challenges in the operation of the mental health services.  The ongoing shortfall of investment in mental healthcare in the context of significant increased demand since A Vision for Change was published in 2006 has led to a system that is at breaking point and in dire need of financial attention.<\/p> <p>In 2017, the HSE reported it required an additional &euro;98 million to achieve the staffing for mental health services set out in A Vision for Change.  This figure did not include investment in primary care and the voluntary sector for providing complementary supports.  Accordingly, notwithstanding investment by successive Governments since publication of A Vision for Change, the reality is that upwards of 10% more funding is needed in today's terms and in light of today's demographics simply to fulfil the mental health services programme published in 2006.  Millions of more euro is also needed to develop adequate capacity in primary care.<br\/><br\/>These figures reveal that a step change in investment in mental healthcare is needed.  We must be much more ambitious than heretofore.  We must think in terms of ensuring that everyone has speedy access to the mental health support they need.  If not, the costs will be felt everywhere else in our health and social system, from higher costs for physical healthcare to higher disability and illness benefit payments to higher supported housing costs and lost productivity for employers.<br\/><br\/>A report published by the London School of Economics, LSE, identified total expenditure on healthcare for mental illness - the term used in the UK - amounts to some &pound;14 billion a year.  In addition, untreated mental illness amounts to more than &pound;10 billion in physical healthcare costs each year.  If the same model were used for Ireland, which has higher cases of untreated mental illness, that cost would be in order of &euro;700 million.<br\/><br\/>The Healthy Ireland framework reports the economic cost of mental health problems in Ireland is &euro;11 billion per year, much of which is related to loss of productivity.  Similarly, a recent report published by the Work Research Centre, WRC, identified:<\/p><blockquote>The economic costs of mental health disorders are enormous, with figures suggesting this may amount to as much as 4% or more of GDP in some countries.  Although substantial costs accrue to mental healthcare systems, the main economic costs are located in the labour market and social protection systems, not just for those experiencing poor mental health but also for other family members.<\/blockquote><p>The high burden of disease attributed to mental health difficulties highlights the need for adequate investment in mental health.  The evidence based review on the refresh of A Vision for Change clearly identified:<\/p><blockquote>Studies have shown the substantial returns on investment that a broad range of prevention and treatment mental healthcare interventions can yield.  This may include better outcomes for the mental healthcare sector and for the physical healthcare sector, cost-savings arising from prevention, and substantial cost-savings and other contributions across other areas of the public sector, economy and society.<\/blockquote><p>In addition, the World Health Organization, WHO, recently reported that every $1 invested in scaling up treatment for depression and anxiety leads to a return of $4 in better health and ability to work.  That is a 4:1 return on investment.<br\/><br\/>In 2018, the total budget for mental health in Ireland is just &euro;912 million.  If fully realised, this level of expenditure will equate to just 6% of the overall health budget.  This proportion represents a decrease on previous years and is severely lagging behind both national and international standards.  Notwithstanding difficulties in comparing expenditure between countries, the WRC evidence review acknowledged that Irish expenditure was lower than better performing mental health systems.  An increase in mental health expenditure is required not only for new developments but to maintain existing level of service costs.  These costs increase each year due to demographic changes and other related factors.<br\/><br\/>Even though it is proving difficult to recruit and retain various specialist mental health staff, we believe it is possible to increase investment by broadening the scope of roles within mental health services and reserving scarce clinicians for roles they can uniquely perform.  Mental Health Reform has consistently recommended a shift of focus in recruitment of staff from primarily medical professionals to health and social care professionals, including psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers. Currently in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, there are fewer than 40% of the required number of clinical psychologists in post, fewer than 50% of social workers and fewer than 60% of occupational therapists.  How can a holistic service be provided in that context?<br\/><br\/>While there is a fundamental requirement to invest in specialist mental health services, there is also substantial scope to develop mental health services elsewhere in the system, including in primary care and across the community and voluntary sectors.  It is imperative that mental health is afforded financial parity of esteem in the wider health budget to reflect its significance in contributing to the burden of disease.<br\/><br\/>Mental Health Reform recommends increasing public expenditure on mental health services to 10% of the health budget within ten years and mental health staffing to ensure timely access to all relevant supports for anyone in mental health need, as well as population-wide prevention programmes.  This investment must include resourcing services at all levels of the system, from prevention to community supports to primary care and through to specialist mental health services.<br\/><br\/>There is no national mental health information system to report on the full extent of service resources, provision, quality and outcomes for community-based mental health service delivery.  Mental Health Reform has been calling for such a system in budget submissions since 2013.  It is not acceptable that more than 12 years after publication of A Vision for Change, there is no information system to account for the performance of more than &euro;800 million in public expenditure on mental health care each year.  There is widespread acknowledgment of the importance of such a system from national and international experts, the Mental Health Commission and from the HSE.  The development of an appropriate, electronic mental health information system based on key performance indicators, will assist in the full transparency and accountability for the evaluation, planning, funding and effective and efficient delivery of mental health services.  The WHO's guidance and the UN's human rights framework can inform the creation of an appropriate framework for performance indicators.  Such indicators are in use in England, Scotland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  Mental Health Reform recommends introducing a national, electronic mental health information system within three years of completion of the review of A Vision for Change to enable the planning, implementation and evaluation of service activity.  It also recommends developing up-to-date key performance indicators that show delivery of human rights standards and national mental health policy within one year of the review.<br\/><br\/>We are concerned that the restructuring of governance and accountability mechanisms within the HSE this year has led to the dissolution of the HSE's mental health division and national director of mental health position.  It is vital that coherent leadership in mental health at the national level is not lost in the new HSE structure and that there is clear authority and accountability for a distinct, national mental health budget each year and driving reform of the mental health services.<\/p> <p>Committee members may want to consider making proposals in this regard in the context of legislation which we understand is due before the Oireachtas to increase the HSE&rsquo;s accountability more widely.<\/p> <p> We welcome the wide range of recommendations made by the committee thus far in its interim reports.  We ask members when issuing their final report to consider the following issues which we believe are in line with the committee&rsquo;s terms of reference.  We need to develop mental health services for particular groups that might not get adequate access, including older people, children and young people in the care system, people experiencing homelessness, people from the deaf community, people with intellectual disability, those with autism and people from minority ethnic communities.<\/p> <p> We believe in establishing a national independent advocacy service for adults and children engaged in mental health services.  We have heard so many stories of individuals frustrated at not being able to get the support they need and yet it is remarkable that there is no national independent advocacy service to support individuals to seek redress, to seek the services they need and to ensure their voices are heard by the services.<\/p> <p> We need to ensure that the needs of carers and supporters of individuals with a mental health difficulty are attended to.  We need to ensure the development of adequate services for people engaged in the criminal justice system.  We must acknowledge that the criminal justice system is now sadly an ongoing part of the delivery system for our mental health services and that we must address the mental health need arising in the criminal justice system.  We need to invest in infant and early years mental health services.  We need to recognise and support the valuable, essential and complementary role of the community and voluntary sector in supporting people's mental health needs, including the development of peer-led services<\/p> <p> The committee previously received our full submission containing a review of A Vision for Change.  Further details of all those areas of concern are contained in that submission.<\/p> <p> Given the scale of money involved in mental health and considering the lack of systems in place to track and support performance against such spending at care group level, our specific appeal to the committee today is that accountability in mental health funding and expenditure is prioritised in its final report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530708900,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDaid, who does sterling work and who has the resilience of thousands of people.

Similarly the development of services such as Jigsaw were not specified in A Vision for Change, but we all recognise they are playing an important role that has been worth the investment.

We feel there needs to be a greater sense of urgency in putting in place some basic information about what is happening in the mental health services.  For example, we met with Mr. Stephen Mulvaney, the first national director for mental health, and simply asked him to ensure we knew what the waiting lists for psychological therapies were across the mental health services.  It is a very significant indicator of the scope of provision and people who use mental health services have told us over and over again they want access to it as part of a holistic support structure, but we do not have it yet.

Even if we do not necessarily have enough detail about particular community mental health team support, and how much it costs, we do know the kind of supports people want when they are in severe distress.  We know they want holistic support and want the option of psychological therapy, occupational therapies or social work support, such as with housing and other things.  We know that there are not enough people in those roles to provide those things for everyone who is currently being seen in the specialist mental health services.<\/p> <p>Often we hear anecdotally - we do not have the statistics because we do not have the information system - that a person's team referred him or her to a psychologist but the team said it would take six months or a year, and he or she has been waiting for that length of time.  We would hear people talk about gaps in their occupational therapy support because their occupational therapist, OT, may depart or may go on maternity leave.  The view was take at a certain point that we only need one of each of these professionals, for instance, there is one OT per team and one psychologist per team.  That is not what A Vision for Change says but there was a strategic view taken early on in the implementation of A Vision for Change that it was better to have one in each team than to have a bunch in one team and not in another.  That is a fair enough growth strategy but we never got to the multiples of these other disciplines that were supposed to be in the mental health teams.  That means, simply speaking, that the 30,000 individuals each year who are referred in to the specialist mental health services are not getting the holistic support they should get.  We would benefit from an in-depth evaluation of what happens in community mental health teams when someone is referred to them, what kinds of supports the person is offered, how well do those work, does the person recover and where does he or she end up in life.  We do not have such evaluation and it would be useful to get that done.  That does not necessarily mean that we should not ensure that those professionals are in place.  That is just the mental health services, and then what I have been talking about is in primary care.<\/p> <p> The WRC report is telling us that we are so low in our investment in giving people access to counselling and psychotherapy that there is a vast unmet need.  We can confidently say that if we made that investment in greater access to counselling and psychotherapy for people with common conditions such as anxiety and depression, it would reap rewards.  It would be a good investment and good value for money.  That is the basis upon which I would say it is worthwhile making the investments.<\/p> <p> Similarly, as we have argued on out-of-hours access to services, we have good evidence that where one provides out-of-hours access the referrals to accident and emergency departments drop.  It is expensive to have people going into accident and emergency, and then some of them will be referred into hospital.  We have good evidence that if one has good out-of-hours access to community-based mental health supports, one will have fewer people both referred to accident and emergency and in need of hospitalisation and it is value for money to make those kinds of investments.  Those are the kinds of recommendations that we have made through the years.  It is not pie-in-the-sky stuff.  It is stuff that we know works.<\/p> <p> The &euro;35 million-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400007#F02200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530710100,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Do you want me to take that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530710100,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Would you like to take that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530710100,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1530710100,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Briefly, before Ms Mitchell answers the question on the &euro;35 million, I asked about the &euro;3.5 million for the 114 assistant psychologists.

As a committee, we are trying to come up with suggested solutions to the various issues that are coming at us.  One of the principal issues that nearly every group that has come in to us pointed out is staffing, the lack of staffing and the inability to get staff in the key positions, particularly in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams and adult mental health services.  Consultant psychiatrists cannot be recruited.  Often the consultant psychiatrist is the key person in the chain and as a result, referrals are not being made and key decisions are not being made because the person with the most important input is not there to make them.  It is not acceptable any more to say that we are advertising the position, the position is funded but we cannot get the person.  That is merely sending us around in a circle.  Has Mental Health Reform any thoughts on what we could do or suggest as a committee about rearranging CAMHS teams so that we can fill them with staff?  It might not be the ideal make-up but at least it is a make-up that can make decisions that can allow people to move on and get appropriate treatment and deal with 12 to 18 month waiting lists for young people trying to get into a service that they need today, not in 18 months time.

Patients are admitted and discharged by a psychiatrist.  While that expertise is invaluable, there is scope for more flexibility in the service than what we are operating currently.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have clinical expertise so we cannot speak on whether one clinical perspective is better than another but we can say we are aware of some other countries that do not organise the service in that way and their mental health services are functioning and they seem to offer more ways for clinicians from different backgrounds to be the first point of contact or to make decisions around an individual case at different stages and at different points of the pathway.<\/p>  <p>  It seems to me in the current context that we must explore how it is possible to loosen up the roles, not in a way that diminishes the quality of the support that an individual, a child or an adult gets, but to ask whether it is possible that some individuals referred to the services, as an initial point of contact could see somebody who is not a psychiatrist and if there was proper training in terms of being able to recognise the individual who needed psychiatric input, to be able to draw on that input appropriately but not to leave it as psychiatrists being the only gateway into support.<\/p>  <p>  I think there is scope for exploring that without wanting to come down firmly in terms of a particular model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400009#H00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1530710700,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Chairman, we need to chew on this point because one of the important recommendations we could make from this committee might be to look again at the whole make-up.

It has been a wonderful advantage for members to work with them.  I commend everybody involved.<\/p>  <p>  Twelve years have passed and we still have not come up with a plan.  Twelve years ago, we should have been talking about training nurses and specialists, signing them up and giving them contracts even before they were qualified, thereby covering retention.  In that period of 12 years we had the opportunity and we are still looking at the demographics of areas where accommodation is more expensive.  We could have indexed linked wages and structures to that.  The HSE is wasting so much money that perhaps it could have bought a couple of apartments and put the nurses into them, like the NHS does.<\/p>  <p>  I wrote a synopsis from July 2017 to 2018 on the media coverage of the mental health services and how bad they are.  Regardless of how much we talk about this, the days of talking about it must stop if we must start from scratch.  It is now a couple of weeks before the summer recess and we should be coming back with a final report stating this is our plan as to what should be done and to start now.  The synopsis makes for harrowing reading.  Children with mental health issues are presenting at emergency departments, there are chronic shortages in mental health, more than 2,400 children are waiting for child mental health services and children are waiting 15 months to see a psychologist.  According to the Ombudsman for Children, we are not delivering on the promises we made and it was noted that suicide claimed 70 schoolchildren in one year.  Moreover, it has been reported that suicidal children face long waits to see specialist psychiatrists and that the ombudsman has called for increased mental health funding.  Finally, while referring to being really burned out, a child psychiatrist resigned as conditions were not fit.<\/p>  <p>  That is a brief synopsis of where we have come in one year in the mental health services.  This gives members a broad picture how bad the situation is.  No matter how much we talk about this, the days of talking have to stop.  We talk about money and ring-fencing but we have to take the realistic approach.  We have looked at the budgets over the years, including the additional so-called &euro;35 million or perhaps &euro;15 million with an imaginary &euro;20 million on top that could not be spent.  As the money could not be spent on recruitment, it was not spent.  We should be ring-fencing this.  The money that is being spent in the budgets now is only bringing us to a flat level as to where we should be.  It has been well documented that we are short approximately 500 staff members in the mental health service as it stands and it will cost many millions to bring our staffing level to where it should be.  We need an additional 500 staff members to bring us to what was envisaged in A Vision for Charge and we still would not have sufficient staff for the future needs.  We need to think in terms of forward planning because within the next five years, we will lose 1,700 staff within the mental health service due to retirement and whatever.  I love the honesty being expressed on the issue.  I appeal to the two Ministers responsible to set out a realistic plan.  If they will not invest in this plan, then as a Cork man once said, \"Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.\"  That is what we are looking at in the mental health services.  I have no criticism of Mental Health Reform.  We are not here to criticise.  We praise people at times but inclusion and multidisciplinary teams get my goat at times because nobody knows how many are on each CAMHS team.  It is like going out to a GAA match with 15 on one side and nine on the other and they are calling it two perfect teams.  It does not work.  I think the Government has to look at that.  I do not care what way it is done; perhaps a pilot scheme in an area of high rates of suicide.  We should be investing in these demographic areas and starting the pilot projects.  The approach must be broad.<\/p>  <p>  As an all-party Oireachtas committee, we genuinely get on most of the time but I appeal to the members of other parties to go back and set a marker, a map and a route to run both a proper health service and a proper mental health service.  It goes back to plan A, that is, let us start by investing in training, by treating the people who work in the system with dignity and respect and let us not train our staff for export but to make them proud of the system.  We need to become inclusive in order that regardless of whether one is a psychotherapist, a psychologist, engaged in art therapy and so on, one is part of the full team.  We need to commit to building the full team.  We must make the cake with all the ingredients that are listed on the bottom of the box because if one does not have all the ingredients, one will not come out with the cake one wanted to make in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400009#H00600","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1530711300,"counter":108,"content":"<p>As I do not think there were any questions there, I will move on to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400010#J00100","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1530711300,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDaid and Ms Mitchell for their contributions this afternoon and wish to ask a couple of questions.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the director of the Healthy Ireland policy appeared before this committee.  She talked about how the Healthy Ireland agenda is embedded in all the Departments, that there is an interdepartmental and whole-of-society approach and that taking care of one's mental health is a significant part of the approach.  Today, the witnesses mentioned the Healthy Ireland policy in their contribution and the economic cost of &euro;11 billion per year.  Of course that is only the economic cost and it does not include the cost to individuals and their families.  It became very clear from other contributors who attended our meeting last week that substance misuse is causing enormous mental health problems in this country.  Do the witnesses think we are doing enough to convey how substance misuse damages one's mental state?  Do the witnesses believe that people are aware that cannabis or alcohol inflict damage on one's brain?  As for conveying the message that exercise and eating well is important, I believe that a focus on preventative measures will be crucial to our report because we want to keep people well in order that they do not need to access services and we want to empower and enable them.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to know whether sufficient use is being made of psychotherapists in the system.  Earlier reference was made to the number of psychologists and psychiatrists and whether sufficient use is being made of psychotherapists.  Again, a point that arose in some of our engagements is that there are approximately 1,500 psychotherapists here and many of them are available to deal with whatever cases come before them. <\/p>  <p>  Do the witnesses think the HSE should ensure art therapy is given a therapeutic role?  I know that art therapy is really important, particularly to young people as it helps them to express themselves when they cannot express themselves verbally.  The witnesses undoubtedly will correct me if I am wrong but I do not know whether there is a recognised position or proper grade attached to it.  Art therapy is really important to many people who are dealing with mental health issues.  Is there a recognised position?  Such a position would be beneficial.  While artists visit facilities on a freelance basis or whatever, without a proper grade they are in a vulnerable position.  If we want to provide art therapy then we must mainstream the service.<\/p>  <p>  Do the witnesses believe the facilities available across the country are adequate for what we want to provide to people?  Recently we all decided to visit our local child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Yesterday, I visited St. Fintan's Hospital in Portlaoise, County Laois.  As I travelled towards the main entrance I thought that were I a 14 year old who was being admitted there, I would be completely intimated by it because the entrance looked fairly forbidding.  I would feel intimidated even if I was an adult seeking care.  Should we not spend more of the capital spend on these facilities to ensure they look welcoming?  An awful lot of work has been done inside of the building but an awful lot of work remains to be done.  I ask the witnesses to outline what standard these facilities should reach to better help patients.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brassil mentioned the number of people who are available to deal with the cases.  Is there an argument to be made for upskilling additional clinical nurse specialists who could intervene at a very early stage?  Such specialists could also refer people, rather than have them spend time on a list waiting to be seen by a psychologist, psychiatrist, psychotherapist or whoever.  Is there scope for such a position?   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400010#J00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530711300,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Mental Health Reform is part of the coalition that supports the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.

The Deputy is right to say there is a link between substance misuse and mental health difficulties that is not discussed enough in the public domain, in both directions.  We could do much more in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  As for the question on the sufficient use of psychotherapists, earlier I stated we should vastly increase people's access to counselling and psychotherapy.  We should not underestimate the potential for psychotherapy within the specialist mental health services as well.  Some clinicians used to have the view that people with certain diagnoses were not appropriate for counselling and psychotherapy.  I hope that we have moved beyond that view.  Even if one has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, a schizo-affective disorder or a psychotic disorder, there might be real reasons one could also benefit from counselling and psychotherapy because one will likely have gone through real losses in one's life that one might need to explore.  There are issues of having become more isolated and all kinds of emotional issues that might benefit from being explored.  I say that as a layperson and not as a clinician.<\/p>  <p>  I am really glad the Deputy mentioned a role for creative arts therapists because it is something about which we have not always been vocal.  We would be very supportive of ensuring that a future mental health system incorporates and embeds the role of creative art therapists as part of the options available for people.  The area was neglected in A Vision for Change and that situation should be rectified in any future mental health policy.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the facilities for mental healthcare, we know that there are problems with the facilities at all levels.  I refer to community residences around the country that are not accessible for people although they have been people's homes for years.  I agree with the Deputy when she mentioned day facilities and clinics that are not located in welcoming environments.  Many people have told us that many inpatient settings in acute facilities need to be upgraded.  My organisation would really support investment in that area and in ensuring there are respectful and welcoming environments for people in distress who seek assistance.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we should explore the upskilling of clinical nurse specialists as one of the options.  We must consider all of the options and, therefore, should be open-minded.  I ask all clinicians to be open-minded about considering a range of ways that we will need to adapt to higher demand.  There is enough need to oblige us to call upon everyone who is able to provide different types of support and we must also be creative about drawing on their expertise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1530711900,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDaid for her presentation and for her work over the years.

What impact would it have on the service if we were to follow that?  It picks up on what Deputy Brassil said about having a psychiatrist-centred service.  If the scope of roles within the service were broadened, what would be the impact?  I note also the importance of primary care as a means to deliver a proper mental health service for people.  Dr. McDaid is looking for more resources for primary care.

The first relates to quicker access.  We are very well aware in the community that one of our biggest problems is giving people timely access to care.  The waiting list for CAMHS is the most visible aspect of that but there are other areas of the service where people cannot get access and where there are no lists to demonstrate that lack of access.  That is one impact that would be very visible.  The other impact would be in the context of choice.  If there were a greater variety of roles, individuals attending services would have more choice in terms of the kinds of supports they would pursue in their recovery.  That is very important from a human rights perspective because services should be in keeping with people's preferences for treatment.  It is also something we know people want.  We are all different in terms of what will assist our recovery.  For one person, social prescribing will help in getting a prescription for a community group or a gym whereas one-to-one therapy will work for another person.  For another person, it might be group therapy and for someone else it might be creative arts therapy.  Someone else might need medication while another person might need regular support from a psychologist.  To get philosophical for a moment, each person will have to shape his or her own recovery.  That is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health supports work best when they respond to the preferences of the individual.  When people attend a service which is more one size fits all, one finds that they simply switch off.  They may try to find supports on their own, but they may not be successful in doing so and their mental health may deteriorate.  While it is positive that more and more people from all kinds of backgrounds are coming forward for mental health support because we are reducing the stigma, if more men come forward for counselling and psychotherapy when it used to be more women or girls, something tailored to them might be required.  That is why we need to explore things like e-mental health whereby support can be accessed online by individuals who are not comfortable going to a clinic.  As such, more choice is a potential positive impact.  Ms Mitchell might be able to address the resources needed in primary care settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530711900,"counter":115,"content":"<p>There are one or two quick wins.  We could invest significantly in supports such as counselling in primary care and increase our investment in primary care psychology.  However, we need to go a lot further.  For example, GPs are trained in mental health, but there has yet to be an evaluation of the impact of that training.  We need to look very closely at whether people are provided with the information they require when they see a GP or another primary care professional.  Are they being referred to other community and voluntary supports in their local areas?  We are looking for primary care professionals to be able to identify where there is a mental health difficulty, assess it and the need for referral to other services such as talking therapies as well as to refer appropriately to mental health specialists.  The mental health system works best when there is appropriate integration and collaboration across the sector and the agencies within it.  We also need to look at effective collaboration between primary care services and secondary services.  For individuals who have been in specialist mental health services and hospitals and come back to the community or continue to avail of community specialist mental health services, it means also getting supports at primary care level.  Primary care professionals should be adequately resourced to provide that support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1530711900,"counter":116,"content":"<p>It completes the circle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400011#K00400","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530711900,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services has made a commitment to extend those adult mental health services which do not have seven-day cover to seven days a week and we know that is costing approximately &euro;5 million.  Given that there are fewer child and adolescent mental health teams, one speculates that the cost would be a little less albeit in and around the &euro;5 million figure.

As ever, it has been an enlightening meeting.  The Mental Health Parity Bill passed Second Stage in May - which was mental health month - with cross-party support.  Unfortunately, a message was received from the Ceann Comhairle today to the effect that the Bill requires a money message from the Government.  The Bill's provision mirror those which are already in operation in the UK.  Could the witnesses address the importance of parity and having equality of supports?  It does not mean that for every penny spent on physical health, a penny must be spent on mental health services.  Rather, it requires that mental health has parity of esteem in the context of support.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to what are sometimes called silos and to the gatekeeping that goes on, particularly in respect of mental health supports for schoolchildren.  I have raised this with the Department of Education and Skills on a number of occasions.  A report by Dr. Rosaleen McElvaney of Dublin City University's school of nursing and human sciences, which was funded by St. Patrick's mental services, was published recently.  The report finds that primary schools are struggling to help suicidal children as young as four years of age.  It reflects what I experience as I go around talking to primary school principals, teachers and other staff who are struggling to cope with very serious mental health issues which are starting to arise and which were perhaps not as common ten, 20 and 30 years ago.  A great deal of it is to do with the Internet, what young children can access on it and the effect it has on them psychologically.<\/p> <p>Much of this is meant to be addressed by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, but there are issues with children being on the wrong waiting lists.  Sometimes they are on a waiting list for a year and then are told they should have been on a different waiting list.<\/p> <p> Will the witnesses comment on silos and the gatekeeping that goes on?  CAMHS have little to do with community psychologists and they are treated separately.  Will they comment on the disjointed nature of how we address the mental health needs of our young people in particular?  For example, it was reported that there were 110 children under the age of four waiting over one year for access to community psychology services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400011#K00600","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530712500,"counter":120,"content":"<p>What do we mean by parity of esteem for mental health?  The Deputy is correct that it is not all about money but money can be an indicator of intent.  For example, in our thinking around the budget for next year, we recommend the Government meets its commitment on &euro;55 million which the Minister for Health has indicated would be invested next year in additional development funding.  We also recommend that mental health services would not lose out any more in the overall health budget.  This is important because if it is not done, it sends a message that mental health is less of a priority than other parts of the health system.<\/p>  <p>  Parity of esteem can be thought of in another way, namely equivalent outcomes and quality of service in mental healthcare to those expected in physical healthcare.  For example, take the case of somebody receiving a diagnosis of cancer.  Imagine if he or she went into our cancer services and was told that he or she will get chemotherapy but not radiotherapy because we do not have enough of the right disciplines to provide it.  This would mean that they might not recover fully and may actually die but that is the best we can do.  That would not be considered acceptable by the public.  However, that is what we are doing every single day in our mental health services.  We are saying that we do not have the adequate supports in place for someone in mental distress.  In turn, this means that he or she may not recover as quickly or, in the worst-case scenario, he or she may lose his or her life.  We are saying this is acceptable.  We need to change that and start having a conversation about having the same standards of care and the same expectation of outcomes from mental health services as we do from physical health systems.  That brings the parity of esteem issue to a different arena.<\/p>  <p>  Silos are the bane of our system.  We orientate illnesses around a certain category and then it becomes hard to bridge that category to another.  Accordingly, we have services for children with disabilities and services for children with mental health difficulties.  If one happens to be a child who is in both categories, then one is bounced from pillar to post rather than getting a coherent system.<\/p>  <p>  We have advocated generally for a no-wrong-door approach.  In other words, if one seeks help from a public service that is, broadly speaking, relevant, then it should be the service&rsquo;s job to co-ordinate, integrate and find the supports one needs and then bring them to the patient.  It should not be a case of the services saying that the patient is on the wrong list or not in our group and, therefore, it is up to the individual in need to navigate and find the services he or she needs.  We have spoken about this in terms of individuals with mental health difficulties and substance abuse.  If the committee were to endorse that principle on a higher level, namely, that the entire mental health system should adopt a no-wrong-door approach, then that could apply anywhere.  That would drive services to have to be more integrated and to engage more with their peers because they would not be allowed to simply kick matters to touch.  They would instead have to find and engage with the myriad services that exist.  There are other specific examples on how to improve co-ordination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530712500,"counter":121,"content":"<p>There has been some recent movement on mental health and education.

Relative deprivation is arising as an issue, as are insecurity of housing tenure, social isolation generally and unemployment in terms of how they affect people's self-esteem and self-confidence.<\/p>  <p>  The mental health agenda has to be owned by every Department.  When considering next year's budget, social welfare expenditure, the minimum wage or housing issues, part of the thinking must be whether the decision being made will improve people's mental health or have a negative impact.  I would like this approach becoming integral to the way we think about mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018070400013#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1530713100,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDaid, but we are running out of time.

I have a difficulty with the oversight group for A Vision for Change.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, and Mental Health Reform conducted a review, but it was kicked down the road as part of an oversight review, which is one of the issues we are trying to tackle.  Will Dr. McDaid make a brief comment on this point?<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the matter raised by Deputy Kenny about our area in Dublin South-Central, I got a response from the HSE about the increase in the female mortality rate there.

The Mental Health Commission's answer to us about places it had claimed were unfit for purpose or habitation was not great.  For example, it had been saying the same about St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane for ten years before it finally closed down.  The commission's response was that there was nowhere else for the people there to go.  Surely that should have been planned for during those ten years.<\/p>  <p>  Three child psychiatrists have resigned in the south east.  A part of that was down to the conditions of the infrastructure being used to deliver mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps Dr. McDaid has discussed the skills mix.  Her submission refers to psychologists.  I would include advanced nurse practitioners as prescribers.  We often ask whether teams always need to be led by a child psychiatrist and whether the skills mix could allow for a multidisciplinary team - read the title to see what that means - to care for children, given the considerable shortage.<\/p>  <p>  We still do not have the full facts on the outcomes and KPIs regarding the &euro;1 billion that we are spending.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance stated in a report today that 300 health service staff were being recruited per month.

It is quite well established, particularly in the United States where they have had to cope with remote areas and providing for specific scenarios.  <\/p> <p> With regard to the Mental Health Commission not closing services down even when they do not comply, I do not know why that is, but I know it seems to be different from the approach the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, takes.  It is hard to make sense of not closing services down in light of the fact that the lack of compliance is around basic regulations and minimum standards.  Services which are failing minimum standards are allowed to continue to operate.  That has to be looked at.  If that means stronger powers need to be granted from the commission, or stronger usage of those powers, that needs to be explored and dealt with.  We have seen deterioration.  We have not necessarily seen a straight improvement in services, even in things that do not cost money, such as care planning, where services might be okay one year but the next year might fail to comply, and the next year the same service might still not comply even though it had been a condition in the previous year.

My colleagues in the scheduled and unscheduled care performance unit and I are pleased to be in attendance.  I am the director of the unit, which was established in the Department of Health at the end of last year.  The core objective of the unit is to improve access for patients to acute hospital services and to reduce waiting times for scheduled and unscheduled care.  I am joined by Ms Susan Scally, who is a principal officer with responsibility for unscheduled care, and Ms Linda O&rsquo;Rourke, who is an assistant principal officer with responsibility for scheduled care.  Ms Mary McCarthy, who is sitting behind me, recently joined the unit as a principal officer with responsibility for scheduled care.<\/p> <p>  I propose to focus briefly on the current position with regard to waiting lists for inpatient day case procedures and outpatient procedures.  I will outline the actions taken to date to improve performance and the plans for the remainder of 2018.  If it is okay, I will update the committee on the waiting list figures to the end of June, which I received after I submitted my opening statement yesterday evening.  I will provide a brief overview on the work that is under way to increase the number of beds in the system in response to the health service capacity review.  My team and I fully recognise the impact on patients of long waiting times to access hospital services and the need to make real improvements.  The health service will treat 3.3 million people as outpatients this year.  It will deliver 1.7 million hospital operations or procedures outside of the additional work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  It is estimated that 435,000 of these 1.7 million hospital procedures, or just more than 25%, are from the waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  While this level of activity is not fully meeting the demand, progress is being made in improving access.  The investment that has been made in this area of health care is delivering better results for patients.  If we are to match the increase in demand for services and to reduce waiting times substantially and sustainably, the reform programme set out in Sl&aacute;intecare needs to be implemented.<\/p><p>The actions outlined to reduce waiting times, improve the accuracy of waiting lists and invest in additional capacity are, nonetheless, important and will improve access for patients.<\/p><p> The programme for Government contains specific commitments to improve waiting times for hospital procedures.  In total in 2017, &euro;17.5 million was provided to the  NTPF to purchase treatment for long waiting patients and in budget 2018 this investment was increased to &euro;50 million.  NTPF activity recommenced in April 2017 and, in July 2017, the number of patients waiting for such a procedure stood at a high of 86,100.  By the end of 2017, the numbers waiting had reduced to just under 81,500.  Inpatient figures at the end of June stood at 78,000, that is, patients waiting for a hospital inpatient or day case procedure, IPDC.  This represents a drop of 8,100 or 9.4% in the 11 months since July last year.<\/p><p> In April this year, the Minister for Health published the inpatient and day case action plan 2018, a joint initiative of the Department of Health, the NTPF and the HSE.  Under this plan, the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case treatment is targeted to fall below 70,000.  It is estimated that during 2018, approximately 133,100 patients will be added to the published waiting list.  To achieve the target of under 70,000, the IPDC action plan commits to remove approximately 145,000 patients from the waiting list this year through a combination of HSE and NTPF activity.  The NTPF accounts for 20,000 procedures.<\/p><p> Several factors, including the cancellation of elective treatment and the increase in emergency procedures due to significant emergency department, ED, pressures, have resulted in fewer procedures for patients on waiting lists in our public hospitals.  However, through the active monitoring of the action plan and the close collaboration with the HSE and the NTPF, it has been agreed that the NTPF will now target an additional 2,300 procedures in 2018, or a total of 22,300, to ensure targets are met.  This level of activity represents a significant increase on 2017, where some 8,200 patients were removed from the IPDC list arising from NTPF activity.<\/p><p> The NTPF, working closely with the HSE, has invited all hospital groups to develop proposals to maximise the use of existing facilities and capacity.  The NTPF advises that it has received 70 different proposals across all hospital groups.  Arising from this, from January to June this year, more than 3,500 offers for treatment in a public hospital have been accepted and 2,400 patients have been treated.<\/p><p> The outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge to be addressed in 2018.  At the end of May there were 511,000 waiting for an outpatient appointment but this was reduced by the end of June.  To address the issue of increasing outpatient waiting list numbers, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are finalising an outpatient action plan for 2018, which is due to be published shortly.  This plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with its national service plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of the waiting list, and trial a number of NTPF-funded interventions, including weekend and out-of-hours clinics.  The validation of waiting lists is an important part of the successful management of waiting lists and clinics.  Since the end of 2017, the HSE and individual hospitals have undertaken validation of waiting lists.  To build on this momentum, last month the Minister approved the establishment of a central validation function in the NTPF to centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE.  The fund envisages being in a position to commence validation of patient files from September of this year.<\/p><p> Work on the development of an integrated waiting list solution, tailored specifically to meet the needs of our health system, is being advanced this year.  The NTPF has examined the feasibility to progressing to an integrated system.  This report is being reviewed by my unit with a view to establishing a high-level governance structure at system level to lead on implementation.<\/p><p> Ireland is experiencing a growing demand for health care services, which is evident in the increasing number of patients being added to waiting lists and the increased pressure on our hospital EDs.  Increasing capacity is therefore central to improve access, both through our emergency departments and for scheduled care and waiting lists.  As part of budget 2018, the Government provided an extra &euro;30 million in 2017 and a further &euro;40 million in 2018 to alleviate pressure on our EDs last winter.  To the end of May 2018, total attendances were up 3.5% and admissions up 2.2%, compared to the same period in 2017.  For those aged over 75, in the first five months of the year attendances rose by 5% and admissions by 5.5%, compared to the same period in 2017.  This increased demand has contributed to an 11% increase in the number of patients on trolleys, compared with the same period in 2017.  Delayed discharges also remained elevated during the winter period.  The trolley figures during April and May began to stabilise relative to the preceding months in 2018.  The national daily average 8 a.m. trolley count has been falling since March, with 340 in March, 297 in April, 251 in May and 224 in June.<\/p><p> The health service capacity review indicates that Ireland has among the highest acute bed occupancy rates in the developed world at 94%, significantly ahead of the OECD average of 77%.  The national development plan provides for a major increase in capacity across the health system, including the development of new dedicated elective-only hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  The aim of these hospitals is to both increase capacity and provide for a better separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.<\/p><p> Increasing capacity alone will not address the challenges faced, but on the basis of significant reform over the next decade, the report recommends an additional 2,600 acute beds by 2031.  The NDP provides for the full complement of beds by 2028, three years ahead of schedule.  As a first step toward implementing the health service capacity review recommendations, the Minister asked the Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds which could be front-loaded in 2018 and into 2019 and 2020 to alleviate overcrowding.  This proposal will seek to increase capacity in both acute hospitals and community settings.  The implementation of this proposal will require a mix of capital investment, including a programme of modular builds.  A key element of the proposal is the identification of the workforce requirement and the development of plans to meet these requirements.  These proposals are currently under consideration by the Department and the Minister.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide a summary of activity under way.  My team and I will endeavour to answer, to the best of our knowledge, any questions from the members. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bolger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bolger.

The total number of ED attendances has increased year on year while bed capacity has remained largely unchanged.  This has created significant challenges for hospitals which manifest primarily in emergency departments but it is also creating challenges in terms of elective access.  In the current year alone, ED attendances are up by 2.3% compared to the same period last year.  This is on top of an increase in ED attendances of almost 3% during 2017 and 4.3% in 2016.<\/p> <p>  A key additional challenge facing our hospital and GP services is the sustained increase in the number of older patients presenting to ED.  During 2017, hospitals reported an increase of almost 6% in the number of older patients attending ED with some EDs experiencing upwards of 10%.  This year to date, a further increase in this age group has been observed with the number of presentations up by a further 3.4% compared to the same period last year.  Typically, patients aged over 75 have more complex care requirements, are more likely to need to be admitted to hospital for treatment and will have longer lengths of stay.  This means that the available capacity is under increased pressure as we do not have sufficient patient discharges every day.<\/p> <p>  The numbers waiting on trolleys at 8 a.m. fell by 3% during 2017 when compared to the full year 2016.  The number of patients on trolleys between October and December was consistently lower than for the same period in 2016.  These improvements were directly linked to increased capacity in a number of hospitals and sustained focus by hospital groups and community health organisations on reducing delayed discharges and improving patient flow.  Targeted funding for emergency services in 2017 enabled consistent improvements in the wait time for funding under the fair deal scheme and an increase of up to 300 beds during the year.  The trolley improvements were maintained to year end 2017.<\/p> <p>  The issues of overcrowding and the length of time patients wait in ED are a concern for both patients and staff, compromising a safe environment for assessing and treating patients.  In 2017, the HSE sought to tackle both issues through investment in emergency departments, with UL opening its new emergency department in June 2017, and upgrades were undertaken in St. James's Hospital and at Mullingar.  The major capital development of 80 beds, theatres, and an expanded ED in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, is opening on a phased basis in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The HSE has continued to focus on full compliance of no patient waiting over 24 hours and improvements have been made as compliance with this metric is now 95%.  A key challenge for most hospitals is the lack of sufficient isolation facilities or single rooms required to ensure that infection control issues are managed appropriately.  As a result patients can wait for significant periods for suitable accommodation.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, funding of &euro;5 million was provided to support the cost of upgrades in EDs and wards aimed at addressing infection control, security and environmental issues.  The first four months of 2018 have seen the number of patients on trolleys increase due to increased attendances and the age and acuity of patients presenting.  However, there has been a stabilisation from April onwards with May showing an improvement against the same period in 2017 of 2.5%.<\/p><p>The number of confirmed influenza cases and influenza outbreaks during the 2017-18 flu season exceeded all previous records in Ireland, including the 2009 pandemic.  The impact was particularly severe for those over 65 years of age, with 2,218 confirmed influenza hospitalised cases and 85 intensive care unit, ICU, admissions in that age group.  Key challenges this year have been the sustained increase in influenza cases, insufficient isolation facilities and delays in the discharge of patients to home and other community settings.  A further challenge was the incidence of influenza in nursing homes, which prevented new admissions from hospitals for periods in early 2018.  Funding of &euro;40 million was made available in winter 2017-18 to support surge pressures.  Of that, &euro;30 million was allocated to support additional home care packages, transitional care and aids and appliances, while the remaining &euro;10 million was allocated to support the opening of an additional 260 beds during 2018.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the extraordinary measures taken over the winter period to manage emergency activity, there is evidence to suggest that access to elective care is being crowded out.  The Chairman and members will be well aware of the challenges that the HSE and, more importantly, patients are facing in terms of accessing outpatient and inpatient or day case services in public hospitals in spite of the significant volume of activity undertaken in hospitals on an annual basis, with 3.3 million patients seen as outpatients and 1.7 million procedures carried out.  The latest waiting list information shows that at the end of June 2018, there were 511,000 patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment and 78,000 patients awaiting a surgical procedure.<\/p><p> Although a significant volume of patients are waiting for treatment, we have begun to make progress in this area.  That is evidenced by a fall of more than 8,000 or 9.4% from the high of 86,100 in July 2017 in the number of patients waiting for a hospital inpatient or day case procedure.  The latest figures also show that 58% of patients awaiting an inpatient or day case procedure are waiting less than six months and 83% are waiting less than 12 months.  The progress in reducing the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure comes as a result of Government investment in the area, supported by increased focus and collaboration across the HSE, the Department of Health and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  In budget 2018, &euro;50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients.  The inpatient and day case action plan published in April is a joint initiative between the Department, the NTPF and the HSE with the aim of reducing the overall number of patients waiting for treatment.  Among its central goals are that by the end of 2018 fewer than 70,000 patients will await treatment, down from the historic peak of 86,100 in July 2017, and that 10,000 fewer patients will be waiting longer than nine months.  Under the action plan, the NTPF has committed to provide 20,000 procedures for patients through the purchasing of additional activity in public or private hospitals.  The HSE, working with the NTPF, has invited all hospital groups to develop proposals to maximise the use of existing facilities and capacity.  For example, in the University Limerick hospitals group, dedicated cataract theatre capacity is being opened in Nenagh Hospital and the NTPF will fund treatment for patients there in 2018.<\/p><p> Although progress is being made in reducing inpatient and day case waiting lists, the outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge, with 511,000 waiting for an outpatient appointment.  Each year, 3.3 million patients attend hospital outpatient clinics.  Slightly more than 70% of patients wait less than 12 months and approximately 60% wait less than nine months, while just under 50% wait less than six months.  In order to address the issue of rising outpatient waiting list numbers, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising an outpatient action plan for 2018.  The plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with the national service plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of waiting lists and trial several NTPF-funded interventions, including weekend and out-of-hours clinics.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that almost 500,000 outpatients did not attend their appointment in 2017.  The validation of waiting lists is, therefore, an important part of the outpatient action plan and the successful management of waiting lists and clinics.  Since the end of 2017, the HSE and individual hospitals have undertaken validation of waiting lists.  In order to ensure a consistent approach in that regard, the NTPF, through engagement with the HSE, has developed a proposal to establish a central validation office in the NTPF, which will centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE.  The NTPF has begun to engage with the HSE at national and individual hospital level to progress this proposal and envisages being in a position to commence validation of patients from September of this year.<\/p><p> Key enablers to the development of more sustainable solutions for access to services are the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the recommendations of the health service capacity review.  The capacity review acknowledges that our acute capacity is not sufficient to meet our current demands, with hospitals operating at almost 100% capacity.  The report sets out a clear plan for the delivery of 2,600 beds, as well as sustained investment in primary and social care services.  The HSE is working closely with the Department to agree a robust implementation plan for core recommendations of the review, with clear milestones for delivery of changes in the model of care delivery and investment in additional capacity.  The HSE has established a capacity steering group and more recently a task finish subgroup to progress this programme of work.<\/p><p> I and my colleagues will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I will now open the discussion to members, who I will take in groups of two.

The report provided by Mr. Woods refers to the 2,600 additional beds required and the issue of elective hospitals.  Project 2040 contains plans in that regard.  What progress has been made on the elective hospitals projects?  For instance, Cork was identified as requiring a new hospital.  A committee was formed to further the project but I understand it has not yet met.  What progress has been made in that regard?  This is an urgent matter and if the relevant people are not meeting to identify sites, etc., how can the project be delivered?<\/p> <p>  The report refers to 477,000 people not attending for appointments.  What progress has been made in regard to updating how people are notified of appointments, such as by text and so on?  Many areas of the HSE now notify patients by text but all areas should do so.  Obviously, that would reduce the number of people who get the date of their appointment wrong for various reasons, such as ill health, and may not notify the hospital of that.  Some 477,000 is a significant number of non-attendances, almost 10,000 per week, and is a significant drain on the service.  For example, if 50% of patients do not turn up for their appointment at a particular clinic, a huge amount of time is wasted.<\/p> <p>  There is a substantial waiting list for gynaecological services in Cork.  Some 40% of those on the waiting list for the entire country are in that area.  What progress has been made in reducing the number waiting for gynaecological services in Cork and what further action needs to be taken?<\/p> <p>  In the past two weeks, I have become aware of a very serious problem in regard to access to psychiatric services for young people.  A young person was admitted to Cork University Hospital in April of this year but has not been seen by a psychiatric consultant as there are none covering that geographical region of Cork.  Consequently, the young person cannot access the CAMHS programme.  His parents are extremely concerned and he wishes to get access to services.  There appear to be territorial boundaries such that a consultant in charge of one area will not see a patient from another area.  In the era of modern medicine, it is outrageous that this 15 or 16 year old boy requires access to services but cannot access them because of entrenched positions.<\/p><p>I need some clarification in that regard.  This is an area in which we have seen a number of serious incidents involving young people and there is a need for access to services.  The consultant who was there has either retired or resigned.  There was a locum in place for period who has now gone and there is no consultant covering the area.  Young people who want to gain access to the service cannot do so.  There is a need for some accountability on the matter.  I have referred to someone who is on a waiting list.  The issue is extremely urgent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#G00700","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates, particularly my two local HSE representatives.  <\/p> <p>  We have talked these issues to death in the Chambers.  It has been ongoing for decades and the blame game goes on all of the time.  I have read the Department's statement, but what is the plan?  The HSE does not act in a silo.  We need to refocus some of our attention onto the Department.  We now know about issues with the budget for this year.  What are the plans in that regard?  It will have an impact on our discussion.  When is the Department cutting things off or is it just going to run on?  The answer could decide whether we are to have a general election.  I am not joking when I say that.  There is a significant budget overspend.  How is the Department going to manage it, given the topic we are discussing?  Let us not have a generic, rubbish answer.  The officials are obviously planning for it.  I have been in Departments long enough myself.  What are they going to do this year that will be different from they did every other year?  Are they going to do something different?  They should tell us now in order that we can prepare for it.<\/p> <p>  Does the Department think the recent and forthcoming changes to structures in the HSE are having and will have any impact on service provision?  I would appreciate it if Mr. Bolger answered that question.  There is a lot of change.  A new board is being appointed before a chief executive, something I suggested to the Minister and in fairness he took up my suggestion.  It looks like there will be the reintroduction of regional structures, which is necessary.  There are new positions being advertised, as well as lots of stuff going on.  Is all of this change having an impact and, if so, is the impact negative?<\/p> <p>  My final question is about a budgetary issue from a departmental vision point of view.  When I look at eldercare services in particular, I have a real issue.  It is a real bugbear of mine that from a financial and a service provision point of view, there are escalating costs associated with home care as compared to helping people in nursing homes and also with people spending a night in an acute care setting.  The vision is not working to deal with people in the first tier and possibly the second and to provide a third.  This would reduce the problems of some of those working in the HSE because it would reduce the volume of people who end up in hospital and acute care settings.  That question is also for Mr. Bolger.<\/p> <p>  My other questions are for Mr. Woods, in particular.  I live in County Tipperary.  The two biggest issues for waiting lists and accident and emergency departments are South Tipperary General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  They are on either side so we are getting it both ways.  It is a real issue.  Maybe Ms Cowan could outline to the committee how we got a fabulous new accident and emergency department which myself and the Chair visited.  It is three times the size of the old accident and emergency department yet the volume of people attending it increased dramatically over its capacity.  I presume there was research done into why that was the case.  If it was not at that scale in the beginning there are obviously underlying issues.  <\/p> <p>  On the pathways for the groups of hospitals across the country, I will use my own mid-west region as an example.  We have Limerick, Nenagh and Ennis.  I congratulate them on what they did on cataracts.  It is a great example and should be done around the country.  The centre is going to be in Nenagh.  The issue for me is that the pathways by which patients are being managed in the groups of hospitals across the country needs to change.  More people need to be moved out of the model 1 hospitals out to model 2 and 3 hospitals quicker for aftercare and pre-care and there are real issues in how that is happening.  There was only one ambulance in Thurles at the weekend, where there were 50,000 people.  Intermediate care vehicles are something I have been talking about for years; it is a bit of a joke really.  A small bit of investment there would move people pretty quickly.  We would not have the same level of issues in Limerick if we had people moved out to Nenagh and Ennis quicker.  Why is that not happening?<\/p> <p>  This is a rapid fire round.  Have there been any changes to how the HSE manages relations with GPs?  Are lists kept in respect of GP referrals to accident and emergency departments?  Maybe not for public consumption but at least for the HSE, are heat maps done of GP referrals to accident and emergency departments?  What are we doing to ensure that hospitals are run seven days a week instead of five days a week in respect of consultants and work?  Can Mr. Woods update me on the history, decision making and current deployment of modular units across the country?  This was decided some time ago.  There is a proposition from Limerick to put in a modular unit.  Will that be supported?  Will Mr. Woods answer me here and now?  Modular units are proposed for other parts of the country.  When was that first mooted in the HSE, what are the locations and have decisions been made on them?  <\/p> <p>  I have specific issues in respect of paediatrics.  This is a public matter so there is no issue about naming him.  Two weeks ago, a 14 year old boy called Matthew Quinn, who I went and met, was on the Six One news about waiting lists.  He has Down's syndrome and is waiting for a hip replacement for two years.  He slipped and needs an operation.  For two years he has been flipped between Crumlin and Tallaght.  I have read there are issues in the relationships between the two hospitals and in respect of paediatric services.  Meanwhile, a 14 year old boy with Down' syndrome who was asking me to help him get a new leg is waiting for an operation.  What is going on there?  This is only one case.<\/p> <p>  This is the real kicker.  Recently there was a lot of media coverage in respect of the hospital network in the mid-west.<\/p><p>By comparative standards, looking at the staffing ratios in the mid-west versus other parts of the country - and this was in the media for some time - there are 14% less staff in the acute services.  How did this happen?  Why was it allowed to happen?  Why was the mid-west not supported?  Will this be addressed?  Five hundred and sixty staff correlates to the highest mortality rate in Ireland.  Did anyone in the HSE know this?  The cost for those staff - doctors, nurses, specialists - is &euro;22 million.  When will this be addressed?  Why is the mid-west's employment levels, according to these figures, which I have not seen challenged - and if they must be challenged, they should have been challenged by now - that much below the employment levels of all other acute services across the country?  The Chairman knows what I am talking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#H00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Woods might like to address Senator Burke's questions first and then Deputy Kelly's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Sure.

We are focused on getting good practice in place in order that we have optimal pickup and that patients have an opportunity both to be aware that their appointments are coming and to notify the relevant party if they have difficulties with the appointments.  The use of texting is partial, not universal, and needs to roll out more fully.  I accept that in this day and age we could and should look to do it more completely.  The wider point about learning is one on which we are very focused because we have very good practice in sites around the country.<\/p> <p>  Senator Burke referred to gynaecology in Cork and nationally.  We have asked all hospital groups to put forward proposals as part of the work with the NTPF this year for undertaking work both within their own facilities and where they do not have capacity outside in the private environment.

I might offer to bring the Senator back a specific report on volumes in Cork and what is intended this year, but that was open to submission from the group, and I recall it has made proposals in the current year.

They currently have a clinical whole-time equivalent workforce in the child and adolescent mental health services of 76.97, so just under 77 whole-time equivalents.  Their rate of seeing new referrals is not out of kilter with those of the rest of the country nor is their rate of referrals seen per clinical whole-time equivalent, WTE, available.

I will answer the first two and pass the question about elderly care to my colleague, Ms Scally, who is leading a review of delayed discharges and that area.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what the plan is and what we are doing differently.  One of the key things we have done this year is to establish a new unit within the Department which has a clear focus on scheduled and unscheduled care.  This is my unit, and these are some of the members of the unit.  This is our clear focus and this is what we are interested in: driving improvement in scheduled care, which concerns waiting lists, and unscheduled care, which concerns trolleys.  To talk about how we are working, I will focus on three areas: what we are doing in terms of activity, what we are doing about finances and what we are doing to bring forward improvements.<\/p> <p>  We have sought to address activity by setting out and agreeing clear targets with the HSE and the NTPF, particularly in respect of inpatient and day-case activity.  We publish these figures with a very clear and, I think, very understandable target for the end of the year, which is 70,000 people.  We do not just say, \"We will see you in December\" and hope to be successful in meeting that target; we actually monitor the target every month.  We have trajectories that we expect the HSE and the NTPF to deliver each month and we monitor these.  The benefit of the monitoring is that, by working collectively with the HSE and the NTPF - we meet fortnightly at official level and meet with the Minister every month or six weeks on this issue - we are able to address or overcome any administrative challenges or any other challenges that arise.  There have been some examples of issues that we have been able to address.  Second, and more important, we are in a position, as I outlined in my statement, to introduce remedial plans when we are not making progress in line with the trajectory.<\/p><p>This year, at the end of April, we were able to sit down following the winter and say: \"This is where we expected you to be in terms of your activity to meet the 70,000 target and this is where you are.\"  At that time there was a shortfall of between 2,000 and 2,500 procedures.  We were then in a position to go back to the NTPF through the HSE and say what types of steps could be taken to address that.  The plan that has been agreed, to which I referred, is that there will be an additional 2,300 procedures for which the NTPF will be able to offer treatment this year.<\/p><p> The second element is finances, and it links into that area in terms of remedial plans.  This year we have held back all the new funding relating to activity.  All the new development is held in the Department and it is released when we are satisfied the measures that were introduced have been delivered.  This brings an additional level of control to the process from our perspective.  It ensures that the priorities the Government has set out and funded are delivered.  Second, it gives the opportunity to avail of new opportunities as they may arise.  The best example we have this year is that there were certain projects that were not progressing fast and were not going to draw down funding this year.  They were the modular build in Clonmel, a delay in opening beds in Kilkenny and a centralised validation function we established.  By having greater control we were able to address that finance and then reallocate the money that was allocated for those to open the cataract theatre in Nenagh from July.  That is an example of how we are actively monitoring the finances and making changes mid-year to deliver.<\/p><p> The third piece is improvement.  We are taking an evidence based approach and we are fortunate that we are able to build upon the work of colleagues that was undertaken last year relating to the capacity plan.  That sets out the clear challenge the system is facing.  One of the big tasks of Susan Scally and her team for the first six months of the year was working with the HSE to develop proposals for where additional capacity could be introduced into the system.  We have also established a centralised validation function within the NTPF.  This is a very important function.  At one level it will ensure that the waiting lists and the challenges we are addressing are accurate.  It will also offer consistency to patients throughout the country in terms of communications and timelines.  A great deal of work has been done by the Department, the NTPF and the HSE to simplify communications with patients and to send out clear letters of one page that make it very clear what the person has to read, what the person has to do and what the person has to return.  We have trialled that with a number of groups and it has had an impact.<\/p><p> The next matter is working on the basis of the lessons learned process for next year.  In the context of planning for the coming winter, the key question is what lessons we can learn from last year.  It is not so much what happened last year, but the question we are engaging with the HSE on is what happened over and above what it had planned to happen.  We have had much discussion about this.  Liam Woods referred to influenza and we referred to some other issues.  It is not so much that we had a longer influenza season; it is about what was being planned, what happened and what lessons we can learn from that as we plan for next year.  To bring that together on what we are trying to do in terms of the improvement aspect, the ED task force is now in place and what is planned for September this year is an unscheduled care forum that will bring together members of the ED task force and, more importantly, people from around the hospital system and perhaps internationally to look at what processes worked-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#J01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bolger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but the witness might specifically answer the question.

That is probably agreed.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the new ED in Limerick and whether the volumes were anticipated.  Colette Cowan can elaborate on this if it would be helpful, but certainly there was an initial peak before it fell off.  Then there was a gradual rise which is associated with care patterns in the mid-western region.  The underlying challenge, and the Deputy referred to it elsewhere in his questions, is that there is a growing demand for service.  In the mid-west that is presenting at a higher rate than elsewhere in terms of ED services.

The Deputy asked questions about GPs, GP lists, referral patterns for individual practices nobody understood, the work of Shannondoc, which Bernard Gloster might be able to speak to, and whether that was understood in terms of a source of admission into hospitals or referrals to hospitals.  It is, and such data exist within individual hospital patient administration systems.  With regard to the pathways question and the movement of patients from a level 4 to a level 3 or level 2 facility or, indeed, into the community, the models of care are developed clinically.  The Deputy's question or statement is very sensible.  It is a direction we are seeking to travel, to provide as much care as possible at the lowest level of acuity and as close to home as possible or in home if possible.  Clinical pathways that have been and are being developed across the HSE are supporting that.  That is the intention of planning.  It is why the bulk of the winter funding went into home care support.  The Deputy's point about the economics of that is well made.  I agree that the best value and the best location of care are at home.<\/p> <p>  The ambulance service and transport issue in the mid-west is a good example of that.

It also remains under pressure.  As the Deputy rightly says, the demand for increased bypass facilities to more major centres is a demand the ambulance service faces as well as the growth in calls.  In the mid-west region there is a pressure which Colette Cowan can speak further on around patient transport.  There is an advantage in having Nenagh and Ennis which allows for the movement to a more appropriate setting.  Sometimes the challenge in that is transport.  There has been a growth in expenditure on private transport at times to support that, which we would prefer to run through the public system if the national ambulance service can support it.  It has done so, but it remains under strain.<\/p> <p>  On GP relationships, there is work ongoing with GPs in terms of their referral practices and protocols around referral in some specialties as part of our outpatient planning.<\/p><p>There is a very good example in neurology where effectively a consultant, clinical leads and GPs have agreed protocols and the effect in practice has been to reduce outpatient numbers significantly and reduce waiting very substantially.  That is being expanded to other areas both in terms of specialty and across the country.<\/p><p> On the issue of a seven day working week pattern, there clearly is already some seven day working in terms of waiting list work.  Some of the proposals we are receiving are about running clinics on weekends and at night time.  Consultant contracts allow for seven day working patterns as do some other clinical contracts.  Not all contracts provide for this and there is work to be done in that area in the system overall.  The best capacity we can access most quickly is our own that is used most intensively.  I take the point Deputy Kelly makes and there is some work taking place on the issue.<\/p><p> On the issue of modular units across the country and whether a modular unit in Limerick and the University of Limerick hospitals group will be supported, there is a proposal from the UL hospitals group on a modular unit, as the Deputy is aware.  The HSE has submitted that, with other proposals, to the Department and would be supportive of it, subject to deliberations at Government level around increasing capacity in Limerick.  Underlying part of Deputy Kelly's question is the capacity constraint in the UL hospital groups, which we understand.  It has been well researched and clinically validated and we need to invest.  We would be supportive of growing capacity in Limerick, and that would include modular units.  I should add that we are in discussions with the Government which, with the Minister, will need to make decisions in the coming weeks to determine the outcome of that.  We are supportive of capacity as we know it is needed.  To be fair to colleagues in the Department, they are equally aware of it.<\/p><p> The Deputy raises a specific case of an individual child and an issue between Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals.  If I can, I would like to answer the Deputy directly on that individual case.  I do not have the details with me but I can do that.  The more general question the Deputy asks is about co-operation between the facilities and the pathway of care.  I get that and I will revert to the Deputy on that if I can.<\/p><p> The Deputy's final question was on staffing ratios and staff funding.  I am aware of the piece of work to which the Deputy referred but this is connected to the general point around capacity.  I have already acknowledged there is a capacity issue in the mid-west region.  I might ask my colleague, Ms Colette Cowen, to address the specifics relating to the report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#K02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>For the information of members, the new emergency department opened on 29 May 2017 and has now been opened for one year.  This time last year, approximately 179 patients would go through the emergency department each day.  This year we have seen a growth of 5.5% in activity and 210 patients on average per day go through the emergency department.  Last Friday, we had a high of 229 patients attend the emergency department for treatment.  There is a number of reasons for that.  Of interest is that in comparison to last year we have an increase of 2,000 patients aged over 75 attending the emergency department.  This is a significant jump of 5.9%.  Of the 2,000 patients over 75 years who attended for treatment, the figures indicate that 30% will be admitted and remain in the hospital for a number of days to get the full capacity of care they need.  This is a major change.  We are aware that with population growth, we will have an increased need to treat older people in services.  It is known that the Limerick area has the highest number of people aged over 85 living alone.  These older people will acknowledge that they tend to come to the emergency department because it is a safe place for them to get treatment.<\/p> <p>  We have activity from the GP and Shannondoc referrals, which can be high at times.  It is important note in respect of general practitioners, however, that they are working flat out.  They are working long hours and they rely on us for the diagnostic access, which means they tend to send patients in for treatment and care.  We are in discussion with GPs on the development of an urgent care centre.  In recent weeks, a few of them visited an urgent care centre in the United Kingdom with some of my team and some of Mr. Gloster's team as part of the effort to find a diagnostic model that support the GP service.  I am aware that general practitioners are currently commencing or in negotiations on their contract, which is pivotal.  If one wants to assist the emergency department in the mid-west region we need the GP and the primary care service enhanced and supported in their role.  I know the negotiations are under way.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding staffing ratios in the mid-west region, I have a very bright clinical director working for me who analysed a great deal of data from the HSE's national human resources department shared his analysis of them.  Out of his analysis came his concern regarding the number of whole-time equivalent staff in the mid-west region.  We have discussed the matter and we will do further briefing and analysis with national HR to ensure we have the exact facts around those figures because we will need to examine the issue if it is the case that the number is so high.  Given that data can be subject to different interpretations, we need to be factual on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Cowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>There must be something going on given the scale of it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#L00300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>It is challenging to get people to come and work in the mid-west, although not from the point of view of nurses.

I would like to go back to the basics and ask what the problem is because if one looks at our healthcare system from the outside, this should not be happening.  We have young boys and girls waiting for operations for spina bifida.  The average spinal curvature in cases involving scoliosis in Europe is 50 degrees, whereas in Ireland it takes so long to access surgery that curvature reaches 100 degrees and leads to preventable lifelong problems.  We have people waiting more than one year to be accessed for wheelchairs.  We heard at a meeting last week that a child aged two and a half years for whom there are suspicions of autism will not be offered treatment until he or she reaches six years in some parts of the country.  We are all aware that on a human level this is destroying people's lives.<\/p> <p>  In orthopaedics I ended up dealing with people in Cappagh Hospital because the waiting lists had become so long.  One of the clinicians told me that there was a reluctance in some cases to take on new patients.  The waiting lists were so long and the patients were in such severe pain that there was a fear that they would kill themselves or become addicted to morphine before they got to see a consultant and had surgery.  The human cost is extraordinary and we must ask why.  We spend as much money as almost any other country on healthcare.  In that case, the answer cannot be that we do not spend enough money.<\/p> <p>  The capacity review done by PA Consulting for the Department of Health shows that the average age in Ireland is considerably lower than in most other countries and we should, therefore, need considerably less healthcare assets than most other countries.  It also shows we have roughly the same number of general practitioners, acute beds, nurses and doctors as other countries.  What the data show us is that we spend more money than almost any other country on healthcare; we have approximately the same amount of healthcare assets as other countries; we should need fewer healthcare assets because we are younger; and yet we have some of the worst waiting lists in Europe.  In fact, a recent pan-European report showed that the Government waiting time targets of 18 months, if met, which the Government cannot do, would give us the worst waiting times in Europe.  That does not make sense.  If we spend more money than other people, we should need fewer healthcare assets than other people.  We have as many healthcare assets as other people and yet people are waiting in agony in circumstances which do not pertain in other countries.  Why is that happening here?  What are we doing so terribly badly, which other countries have sorted out, that is leading to this pain and suffering all over the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#L01300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I welcome the deputations and thank them all for coming in.<\/p> <p>  The bed capacity review identified a clear need for additional beds in the system.  Mr. Bolger said in his submission that the Minister asked the Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds that could be front-loaded in 2018 and into 2019 and 2020.  What I have to say might save the Department a great deal of work.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has identified that 1,000 beds were closed.  I do not intend to get into the politics of who closed them and why, but they are closed and clearly available to be reopened.  These beds are situated throughout the country.  We know of 19 in Letterkenny.  I know my colleagues, Deputy Pearse Doherty and Senator Mac Lochlainn, have been campaigning on that.  Anyway, the beds are right across the system.  Perhaps the deputations can give me their views on where these beds are and how easily they can be accessed.  Does the Department intend to front-load them in 2018?  The submission is somewhat light on the detail and on where the beds will go.  Obviously, those responsible have clear sight of the plans for the 2018 beds and most certainly the 2019 beds, whatever about the other plans.  Will the witnesses provide the number and location of the beds?<\/p> <p>  That leads to my next question.  Will the witnesses identify how many of those beds are closed due to staff shortages?  I have a view on the relevant numbers.<\/p> <p>  That leads on to my next question, which is on the funded workforce plan.  My understanding is that the Department agreed a funded workforce plan with the nursing unions last year.  The Department did not hit those targets, which comes as no surprise, and, in fact, missed them by a considerable amount.  Much and all as the Department did not achieve its targets in 2017, there is no funded workforce plan for this year.  I understand this matter has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  What I do not understand is why there has been a delay in fulfilling what I understand to be an agreement between the Minister and the trade unions representing nurses.  Department officials do not need me to tell them but I will explain it for the benefit of saying it.  The Department cannot open the beds or solve any of the crises, however these multiple crises were created, unless the hospitals have the staff to do so.<\/p> <p>  We know the Bring Them Home campaign was a spectacular failure.  We know the HSE did not achieve the rather modest targets set out in the funded workforce plan.  If we can identify the beds &ndash; that would be brilliant &ndash; then perhaps the deputations could identify, in the absence of a funded workforce plan, how we will be able to staff those beds.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Woods comment on the practice of counting fourth year nurses as whole-time equivalent, WTE, staff members?  In my time, they were not counted as WTE staff.  If the HSE has started doing that now, will Mr. Woods explain why?  It is not that I am a cynic, of course; I am simply an optimist with experience.  Anyway, to the cynical eye, it looks a little like an attempt to massage the staffing figures.  I sincerely hope it is not, but Mr. Woods might explain whether that practice has commenced and, if so, why.<\/p> <p>  Children are waiting for scoliosis surgery.  Targets were established and missed.  We know the four month waiting target has been missed by a factor of years for some people and for 88 people in total.  I spoke to a parent on Monday.  She came in to see me in my office.  Parents are referring to the practice of what they call aggressive management of lists - these are their words and not necessarily mine.  A letter is sent out to the parents of children who have scoliosis severe enough to require surgery asking whether they still want the surgery.  I can tell the committee in advance that they still want surgery for their children but they do not get enough time to respond.  They refer to this as aggressive management of the waiting list and they are deeply unhappy about it.  They see it as a means of perhaps knocking people off the list.  Again, that is a mechanism by which the figures could be massaged.  Will the deputations comment on that?  That seems to be particular to this cohort but that could simply be because these were the people I was talking to recently.  We could debate all day whether the practice of sending out letters asking people whether they still want a procedure is a valuable use of time.  Certainly, in the case of children with scoliosis it is a reasonable expectation that they will want surgery.  The parents are reporting that they get such a short timeframe to respond and this is causing them serious problems.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Bolger went through all the figures on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  My views on the NTPF are already on record and there is no need for me to rehearse them.  The NTPF accounts for 20,000 procedures.  I have several questions about the NTPF.  Am I right in saying that of the 20,000 procedures a total of 10,000 have been done?  Halfway through 2018, how many have been done?  What value-for-money metrics does the Department use to assess whether it is getting value for money from the NTPF?  How is value for money established?  Can the Department point me towards the value-for-money figures, facts and statistics?  I simply cannot find them anywhere.  Reference is made to how the NTPF will account for 20,000 procedures this year.  Can the Department give the committee an indication of how many have been done and how many have been scheduled?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#M00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I will now invite in Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony for a short intervention and then we will go back to the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#M00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome all the deputations.

The Department must admit that is still a shocking figure and needs to be worked on.  Is there one thing that could solve this?  Sometimes it is not all about funding.  The answer may be along the lines of obtaining and retaining of staff.  Let us imagine the deputations could pick one thing.  What would solve it?<\/p> <p>  I am keen to hear the thoughts of the deputations on the outpatient service performance improvement programme.  As we know, a validation officer rings patients on a list - sometimes the officer sends texts messages - and asks whether they are still interested in staying on the list.  Some of my constituents have run into trouble with this.  Some have said that since they have been living with the condition for so long, they might as well keep going.  Another person was on holidays.  Yet another was careless and the letter was left on a window, as could happen to any of us.  I do not think it is a good system.  Will the witnesses offer their thoughts, please?<\/p> <p>  I am keen to hear the views of the witnesses on putting more funding into local hospitals.  We have a very good hospital in Bantry that could take the pressure off the larger hospitals in Cork if it was given more funding.

There is this view that we need more stuff.  We need more acute beds, doctors, nurses and maybe we do and maybe we do not but the reality is that per age-adjusted population, we already have more of all of this stuff than countries who do not have our waiting lists so they clearly are doing something better than we are with the assets they have that we are not doing.  So what I absolutely am challenging is what is quite a lazy view and I am not pointing Mr. Bolger out.  Groupthink has settled in to the effect that we have people dying on waiting lists and have young boys and girls whose spines are curving because we do not seem capable of getting to them quickly enough.  The answer is that we need more stuff and the NTPF, which Fianna F&aacute;il supports and pushed for, is a sticking plaster, not a structural change.  Given that this new unit has been set up, it is great Mr. Bolger and his team are working on this, I am trying to force the thinking a little here.  It is just not enough to say more is needed if other countries do not have the waiting lists we do with broadly the same assets.  Beyond saying that we need more beds, doctors and capacity, what are we not doing that other countries clearly are because they are solving the problem with a similar level of assets to what we have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#N01100","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point and I will take his question in two parts.  There is a need for an investment and for additional capacity within the system.  There is an evidence base there to support that.  What we can see through the likes of the NTPF is that if investment is made in the right area, more patients can be treated.  I agree the NTPF is a process that is in place to treat public patients and to look at maximising capacity across the board, including in both public and private hospitals and the long-term plan on that, as it is set out in the national development plan, is the development of elective-only hospitals.  I disagree with the point that we do not need more capacity but I fully agree with the point that it is not just about more capacity and that we have to look at how we go about managing things differently.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the inpatient on the day case side, the majority of it is treatment in hospitals.  That is where people need to be treated in most cases.  There are examples of where certain elements of it can be moved into the community but in general, those people need to be treated in a hospital.  In terms of the outpatient, and there is a lot of work going on in this area, there is a huge opportunity to move a lot of that activity and this is what is the basis of Sl&aacute;intecare and other plans over the years.  For example, we are told that most people who turn up for an outpatient appointment require two appointments.  They perhaps need a diagnostic and a meeting with the consultant and in many cases they are referred from their doctor just to receive the diagnostics.  I am not telling the Deputy anything particularly new here but the more of those services that are available in the community, the less pressure that will be on the consultants in the hospital system who do need to see a certain proportion of the people.  The capacity plan is clear that there is a need for additional capacity.  It is not just about beds and that is a point we might get to in terms of some of the staffing.  It is easy to identify additional beds.  It is about beds, additional staff and capital investment but it is also about reform.  That is what is happening.  The challenge is that we do not have enough slots to treat all of the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bolger"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>To return to the Deputy's original question as to what the problem is and where he quoted some data, the expenditure in the health system, whether it is understood at a European comparative level or OECD volumes at a glance in terms of doctors and nurses, I would look at the numbers of doctors in Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>elsewhere.  We are considerably lower and bed numbers are considerably lower.  The point about nursing is a point well made.  The capital infrastructure in our environment is not comparable with some of the other environments with which we would be compared and we know that it does need serious investment.<br\/><br\/>Underlying the Deputy's question and hypothesis is a very fair challenge to say that if we look at orthopaedics, an area he referred to himself, it is very true to say that the model of care for orthopaedics, part of which was developed jointly by a consultant in Cappagh, would clearly identify that up to 85% of an outpatient list can be addressed by a musculoskeletal, MSK, physiotherapist and a consultant will deal with the balancing 15%.  We need to shift the model of care and provide more of that in the community is the goal and that is happening.  There is a primary care centre in Galway where an MSK physiotherapist has been appointed and it is having a very good effect in terms of referrals to hospitals and providing care in the community.  That is the kind of investment that is not the same as saying we simply need more consultants.<br\/><br\/>The model of care for orthopaedics, the demand-supply analysis and the onset of growing demand based on obesity for knees, because the volume of knees to be done in the future will far exceed hips because of obesity, means we need to double the current number of orthopaedic surgeons we have, which is around 80.  That is over a period of time but the other point about ageing is true because on an age-adjusted basis, we are still younger than many of our comparator environments.  One of the challenges that we face, and Mr. Gloster can probably talk more on the operational side on older persons' services, is that we are growing old at a faster rate than others.  The rate of change is what is being dealt with on the ground and that is a real factor.  There are opportunities and I share the view that it is not just about getting more stuff, it is about getting the best that we can out of what we have and investing in capital sensibly.  Deputy Kelly referenced working outside the normal day and looking at our level 2 hospitals.  We are going to face frail, elderly and chronic condition challenges right across our whole healthcare environment, many of which may be able to be addressed in primary care and model 2 hospitals, as well as focusing the major hospitals on precisely what they need to focus on.  I agree with the Deputy's point.  I query some of the data because there are questions in that regard.  Our capital infrastructure, which, based on the new plan is growing substantially and is helpful, is a key driver so that we can be what we need to be.  The investment we need in equipment today is approximately &euro;350 million to bring it to where we would want it to be.  There are efficiency opportunities and productive opportunities within that.<br\/><br\/>In comparison with other environments, we are a cost-based funded hospital environment and many of the others are insurance and transaction based and that may be having an effect on some of the comparative data.  The shift to private spending by individuals in the Republic of Ireland has been quite high over the past few years and that contributes to the cost when we look at it at a macro level.  Often that data is not talking about HSE costs but about global health spend, which is very appropriate but there are real variations in what the HSE spends and what society as a total spends.<br\/><br\/>If an emergency department in Ireland is considered, four to five consultants would be as high as would be seen in an emergency department.  In Scotland they are targeting having ten emergency department physicians per department to provide care so there is strong evidence on the consultant side that we need significant additional resources but I entirely take the point that the need to drive performance and improvement and model change within what we do is also a piece of that.<\/p><p>It will not work and it will be too slow to wait for new buildings to appear to resolve the service challenges that we face.

We will have to agree to disagree about the data.  This is the Department of Health's capacity review and it unambiguously shows that we do not have significantly fewer healthcare assets than others.  It shows that we have more than some countries and less than others.  Those are the facts.  Given that we are younger and have approximately the same assets, what do other countries do that we do not?  Has Mr. Woods identified a number of actions that they have taken which we have not, which do not cost much money?  We are facing into the next budget.  The fiscal space is tiny.  It is a fraction of what Sl&aacute;intecare envisages as being required for all of these beautiful reforms.  We will be living in a very resource-constrained world.  I am pushing this so hard because the extra capacity, about which we will have a longer conversation outside of this meeting, costs a fortune.

The international evidence base, as it refers to clinical practice and location of care, is precisely what we use in clinical planning.  Orthopaedics is an example but there are many others.  There is strong awareness in the HSE, both at population health planning and individual clinical practice levels, as to the need for services and the ideal locations for such service provision.  The thinking which the committee engaged in with regard to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, relating to the appropriate location of care, is an important dialogue which has been referred to on a number of occasions here.  We see high appropriateness of admission in acute services.  When we look at appropriateness of a day of occupation of a hospital bed, we see an opportunity to move people into community facilities or home, with support.  We have to seize that if we are going to get the best value and the best health outcomes at the lowest cost to the taxpayer and to the Exchequer.  Those models will drive where we need to go.  That is about both investment and change; it is not one or the other.  There is a requirement for both.  I would be happy to get into a deeper dialogue about the learning relating to the models of care and integrated care delivery in chronic conditions.  There is interesting work in the HSE on supporting chronic conditions on an integrated basis across hospitals and community care.  That kind of work is a major part of getting the system right in the future for the population demands that we clearly have, which will grow significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Woods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#O00400","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly.

The time targets are short for scoliosis, with a four-month clinical target, so it requires a fair amount of contact with individuals and families.

Life expectancy in Ireland is slightly above the EU average.  We are seeing a growth in the over-65 population of approximately 20,000 people every year, with a growth in the over-85 population of 2,500 per year.  The health status of the older population is probably the most critical factor in terms of demand on services, with 86% of people over 65 having at least one chronic disease and 65% of people having two or more morbidities.<\/p> <p>  In the community healthcare sector, both for mental health and services for older persons, the value of a student nurse came with the fourth year placements.  When it was originally negotiated it was on the basis of two students in and one whole-time equivalent, WTE, out.  There was an expectation of full employment and that, accordingly, the students would finish at the end of the term but now there are so many vacancies that the students are staying on as preregistered between September and Christmas.  There is never a time where there are no students in the system.  The counting of a WTE is based on the traditional 37.5 hours and not related to the grade of student.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#P02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I would prefer to get the written answer promised by Mr. Woods.

There is an imbalance between the demographic changes in the population and capacity, by which I do not mean just bed capacity.  We concentrate on bed capacity but there are huge capacity issues in other services, particularly in primary care.<\/p> <p>  How does CHO 3, with which Mr. Gloster is most familiar, anticipate the manpower issues in general practice arising from the retirement of GPs?  How does it intend to recruit GPs and manage manpower?  There are many issues relating to hospital avoidance and the GP was the gatekeeper to the health service in this regard, acting as a filter to sift through the information to decide who needed to go further for treatment or investigation.  That system is breaking down now because of manpower issues and because GPs are working to capacity.  How would a CHO area anticipate recruiting and retaining GPs and developing that service?<\/p><p>As for the reduction in the number of inpatient procedures by 8,600, which is 9.4%, what proportion is accounted for by actual treatments, and how many of those are just validations of lists?  I refer to cases where people do not need the treatment any more - they have gone to Northern Ireland, have opted for private healthcare, are no longer seeking the treatment or perhaps have passed away.  What proportion of that reduction reflects actual treatments as opposed to validation?  Perhaps the witnesses might outline the common treatments that are being delivered through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Are they just day cases or are they serious cases of hip replacement, knee replacement and those procedures that require a considerable length of time in hospital?  <\/p><p> Mr. Woods and I believe Mr. Bolger referred to the 8 a.m. numbers for patients on trolleys.  I have been looking at the trolley figures for the past number of years.  The numbers are rising year on year.  This year to date, the average number of people on trolleys per day is 500, which is not in keeping with the 8 a.m. figures the witnesses have provided.  Are the 8 a.m. figures different to the trolley watch figures? <\/p><p> Why is University Hospital Limerick consistently the hospital with highest number of people on trolleys, with perhaps double the number of the nearest rival hospital?  I have my own views on that.  I think there is a much greater catchment area for the University Limerick hospitals group.  There is no model 3 hospital in the group, only a model 4 hospital, so everybody tends to end up in casualty there before they are filtered.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment on that.<\/p><p> Following Deputy Donnelly's contribution, I note that the average number of beds for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, is 4,800 per million.  We are at 2,800 per million.  There is a huge disparity there.  The bed capacity review anticipates that the population of the country will increase by a million over the next ten or 15 years.  A million patients equates to 2,600 beds.  The 2,600 beds that are proposed in the bed capacity review may only be keeping track of the increase in population.  It many not actually be a net increase in the number of beds per person.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment on that.  Ever year, flu season arrives and winter initiatives come in.  As a result of that, elective admissions are quite often cancelled between the months of November and March.  How can the health service keep track of elective procedures if, because of bed capacity issues, a bed cannot be found to carry out an elective procedure for four months of the year?<\/p><p> I refer to Sl&aacute;intecare.  It has been 400 days since the Sl&aacute;intecare report was published and we still have not got the Government response.  The Government seems to concentrate on costs, but really Sl&aacute;intecare is talking about reorganising and reforming the health service.  It concerns integrating services and hospital reduction measures, that is, how patients can actually be treated in a better location than a hospital.  It refers to treating them in a community setting and re-orientating the health service towards primary and community care.  I know Ms Cowan has an interest in this.  Perhaps she might comment on that. <\/p><p> Finally, I refer to the \"Bring Them Home\" measures directed at nurses.  I think only three nurses have been recruited this year.  There were 15 last year, 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015.  The witnesses might comment on the reasons why we cannot get our nurses to come back.  I apologise for the large number of questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#P02300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Is it all right if Deputy O'Connell and I ask questions before the answers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#Q00200","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#Q00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Could I be included in that list?

In my professional experience it is important to highlight the good work done by many of the staff in the appointments sections of our hospitals on a daily basis.  They are often on the receiving end of the wrath of patients and GPs who ring up looking for appointments.  I think it needs to be put on the public record that they do a fantastic job.<\/p> <p>  The situation regarding general medical and surgical appointments around the country is not too bad.  They are within an acceptable timeframe.  However, certain subspecialties, like urology, neurosurgery and ear, nose and throat, ENT, are a joke.  Last week I raised the case of Ms Angela Phelan, a lady who was put on an urgent waiting list to see a urologist in University Hospital Waterford.  She received a letter saying that she would be seen in 65 months, which is five years.  That is not acceptable.  By definition, \"urgent\" means high priority.  It means acute, it means critical and it means that we need immediate action.  I am surprised that there is not a raft of medical-legal cases in this country from people who are dying and suffering on urgent waiting lists, not routine waiting lists.  It is not acceptable.  For example, a routine appointment in the urology service in University Hospital Waterford takes nine  years.  That is almost two D&aacute;il terms.  How can the HSE stand over this and what is it going to do about it?  That is my first question. <\/p> <p>  The second question concerns the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  As a GP, I think it is becoming more and more difficult to access this service.  GPs are being forced to jump through more hoops to get young people assessed.  I have received letters and parents have approached me to say their child will not be assessed by CAMHS because after I send in the referral letter, the service rings the parents and says that the GP has not assessed this patient.  I would not have referred the patient if I had not assessed them.  Of course I assessed them.  They are not even believing the referral letters they are getting from GP surgeries.  That is not acceptable.  I have been speaking out about this.  I have spoken to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, about this on numerous occasions.  We need a 24-hour emergency access phone line for GPs to access CAMH services for vulnerable patients who are suicidal.  It is a service that would not be abused and it is something that needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  My third point is that I want to follow on from what Deputy Kelly said with regard to modular units.  They are an excellent idea and I seek an update on the modular unit proposed for Mayo University Hospital.  <\/p> <p>  My final point is concerns community and district hospitals.  What is the HSE's plan?  Does it have a plan to develop these facilities?  In my opinion, they facilitate discharges from acute hospitals and prevent admissions to them.  Is there a specific plan for community and district hospitals?  With regards to what Ms. Cowan said about GP contract negotiations, that is a myth.  There are no negotiations.  They are non-existent.  Let us get that clear. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#Q00800","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and call Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#Q00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Long threatened comes at last.

As the last speaker said, a lot of important work has been done and dedicated staff do a great job.  However, there is some flaw in the system somewhere.  I refer to the point raised by Senator Swanick a few moments ago about someone who gets an appointment for two, three or four years later.  That is farcical and is an insult to the system.  It is an insult to human intelligence and to the patient.  Effectively what it says is the patient does not need any treatment at all and should come back in ten years.  That is what should be done.  The problem is that the person in question remains on a waiting list for a long time.  As a result, when their condition deteriorates they come to the accident and emergency unit because they have to go somewhere.  Such patients are concerned about their health and their families are concerned about them.  To what degree can the witnesses identify and influence the deficiencies within the system that impede smooth progress from the moment that the patient comes into the GP to the referral?  Has the HSE had an audit carried out to reveal them?  It should not take six months from the GP's referral to get the consultant to meet the patient, and another three, four, five or six months before any action is taken.  That is just about the most outrageous system I have ever heard of anywhere.  If those results were seen in a factory somewhere or in any other organisation in society, it would not be tolerated at all.  Yet in the most sensitive area, that of health, this is commonplace.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue on which I would like a response.  I do not propose to wait here for the answers.  I expect to get the answers at some stage between now and next week.  Otherwise I will put down parliamentary questions.  In case someone says I will not get the answers in parliamentary questions, the answer to that is I will.<\/p><p>The age profile of the population has been referred to as one of the main stumbling blocks as to why we cannot provide a proper health service.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, that that is not correct.  We have a younger cohort of population than almost any other country in Europe.  The people who come into this country are young, in their 20s or their 30s.  That is being balanced all the time.  It is not sufficient to say we have many old people who have three or four procedures a year and so on.  I do not buy into it.<\/p><p> Have the deficiencies in the system been identified?  Is there a lack of GPs?  Is there a lack of consultants?  We have identified a lack of beds.  Another 1,000 beds or so would make up the difference.  I remember during the boom times ten years ago that there were unacceptable waiting lists, even though there was plenty of money available.  I do not understand why we are not progressing.  We are in the top three or four in terms of expenditure in the OECD countries, but we are in the third or fourth worst in dealing with patients, waiting lists, downtime and so on.  Why should that be?  The point made by Deputy Donnelly is accurate, that there is something wrong somewhere.<\/p><p> Can the witnesses tell the committee how many of the facilities are vacant or idle at any given time in any week, and for how long, for example, clean air theatres and different types of theatres?  When a patient comes into the system, is there a guarantee that patient will move through the system smoothly and out of the system again?  Is it a lack of anaesthetists, nurses or beds or a combination of all?  To what extent does each of these issues constitute a proportion of the totality of what is required?  We need to know that.  Any efficient body will need to know exactly where its weaknesses are and what can be done to speed it up.<\/p><p> Some hospitals have better records than others in terms of waiting times, bed accommodation and so on.  Why is it that they are successful while others are not?  There are obviously contributory factors.  I do not expect to be told today but I expect to get the answer to that too.<\/p><p> I know there are many good people in the health service.  I would like to have a health service that everyone would want to identify with, that every patient would be happy to be part and parcel of, and that as a result of that we would move forward, taking our responsibilities seriously and recognising them.  Incidentally, I do not have a hang-up about the private or public sectors, but they should be able to compete with each other.  It is always a good sign for both of them but it does not always happen.  If it is found that the private sector is creaming off the top a certain number of patients who are easy to handle or whatever the case may be - I do not know - but I would like to know about it.  We trotted this out before about primary care centres.  I do not know.  The jury is still out on the primary care centres.  They are fine facilities and they look good.  I am not so sure of the extent to which they are cutting off the flow of patients at the community level before they go to the hospital.  I am quite sure they could.<\/p><p> Today's long-term patient on a long waiting list will be an emergency at some stage.  We either deal with it in the first instance or we deal with in the last.  I do not expect to get the answers today.  I have parliamentary questions about all of them, and they might be answered in that way.<\/p><p> I appreciate the Chair's patience in waiting for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#Q01000","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>What about my patience?  When my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, was asking Mr. Bolger why the situation was different here when he was comparing the spend per head with other countries, eventually Mr. Bolger said it was not just about beds but was about staff and reform.  Will he elaborate on what reforms he was referring to?<\/p> <p>  Again in response to Deputy Donnelly's questions, Mr. Gloster mentioned life expectancy in Ireland being higher.  While I do not want to misquote him and I know Deputy Donnelly has left, is Mr. Gloster saying that Deputy Donnelly was not comparing apples with apples, in that it is simple to take a top-line figure for a spend per head, but when there is universal access for children under six to GP services and a roll-out of vaccination programmes, there will obviously be a spend, so it is not as simple as just comparing the oversimplified figures that the Deputy supplied?  Will Mr. Gloster elaborate on that?  Maybe I misinterpreted what he said.<\/p> <p>  In response to my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, Mr. Bolger said the Department does not get into comparing prices and that it does not take on all the tenders that come through.  Thank God that someone is keeping an eye on the chequebook.  He also said that he believes there are controls in place to get value for money.  Again, thank God for that.  When representatives from the HSE come in, it is always someone else who made a decision somewhere else.  I go back to Mr. Woods and Deputy O'Reilly who was talking about whole-time equivalents and student nurses.  Mr. Woods is the national director of acute hospital services operations in the HSE, yet he needs to talk to somebody in HR about who decided that a fourth-year nurse was one whole-time equivalent and not half.  The vast majority of the times that we ask questions of people in the HSE, it is someone else's job.  It happened recently with the CervicalCheck issue.  People continually say that it is someone over here or someone over there.  I am worn out with it always being someone else's question to answer.<\/p> <p>  The real questions I wanted to be answered were asked before I came in and obscure responses were given.  Can somebody, perhaps Ms Cowen, outline why things have improved with the retention of graduates?  Has it been looked at?  Are there plans to focus in on the reasons that we are retaining more graduates and to increase the retention of graduates?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned primary care centres.  I am a firm believer in Sl&aacute;intecare and in moving treatment into the community from the acute hospital setting.  In Smithfield, Dublin, there is a good primary care minor injuries clinic that contributes to accident and emergency department avoidance.  Many people are treated there, and there are good nurse practitioners working there, plastering up people with injuries and referring them to the Mater Hospital.  It may not be true but I have heard this service in Smithfield is becoming very popular.  I used to refer many people there myself when I was working in the community.  I found it to be a brilliant service but people did not know about it at the time.<\/p> <p>  There is a cultural issue where people think they have to go to an acute hospital.  It is just in us to think the best place to go is Crumlin with a sick child or the Mater with a broken arm.  What steps is the HSE taking to try to address that cultural issue, so that people go to the primary care centre as opposed to the acute hospital?  I also hear that patients who should go to St. James's, Tallaght or Blanchardstown are going to Smithfield and in turn ending up referred to the Mater, which receives many patients who would ordinarily be dealt with by the other hospitals.<\/p><p>There is now a capacity issue when it comes to the referral of patients because so many people are being taken in from Smithfield.  How will this be addressed?<br\/><br\/>There are challenges in the area of step-down facilities.  I have heard that when consultants sign off a patient as being fit to return home, they sometimes are reluctant to go to a step-down area.  Have any of the witnesses a solution for this?  Anecdotally, there is no reference to an exit plan when patients are admitted and it is not discussed until it is time to exit.  This is often the case with older people.  If a patient from Dublin 1 is discharged and then is sent to Mount Carmel Community Hospital, which is near where I live, for their step-down he or she might say he or she could not go all the way over there.  Has the HSE put anything in place to try to address this in order that when a patient is admitted, he or she is told that after he or she has been fixed up, he or she will be sent to a particular step-down facility and that is how it works?  I am not talking about forcing people to go anywhere but about bringing patients and their families along with the medical professionals on this journey.<br\/><br\/>I visited Carlow-Kilkenny hospital a couple of years ago, where they had GP referral to fast-track people through the emergency department.  The Mater Hospital has something similar for older people, where a GP can refer them and it bypasses the emergency department.  It works very well.  Older people and their families are much happier with it and it is far preferable not to have older people with chronic conditions waiting in emergency departments, which is not suitable.  What plans does the HSE have to replicate the system used in Carlow-Kilkenny and that in the Mater?<br\/><br\/>Recently I heard that 477,000 hospital appointments were missed.  I understood that outpatient hospital appointment lists already factor in such no-shows.  Will the witnesses elaborate on this?  It is not the case that doctors are waiting in emergency departments twiddling their thumbs waiting on this 477,000 people.  It is built into the figures that a certain percentage will not turn up.<br\/><br\/>Finally, Mr. Woods said that a roll-out of texts was the way forward.  Surely that could be done over a weekend.  We are back to IT.  Even the most basic, small community pharmacy now has a text service for their patients.  I cannot understand how it is that things are done very safely in the community with appropriate data protection and so on but when it comes to the HSE, we almost need two years to do everything and a team of people to implement something that I would have a young one do for me over the weekend.  It is constantly the case that everything seems to take longer.  No one seems to know who is responsible.  It is like the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>.  I would like the witnesses to address those points.  I apologise that I cannot stay to hear the answers.  If the witnesses cannot answer them today, I would like them in writing soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#R00200","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connell.

On the Chairman's question about GP recruitment, we have two vacancies in the mid-west that we are attempting to fill in the mid-west, one in north Tipperary and one in Thurles.  On anticipating those, we have a fair indication as to when people are thinking about retirement.  Many of the Chairman's GP colleagues will stay on for quite some years but we have a general indication.  On what the system is trying to do about that, nationally, last year, the HSE's target was to have 187 GP trainees.  The actual out-turn was 170.  That gives an indication of the transition in respect of filling some of the places.  This year's target is 198.<\/p> <p>  In the mid-west, one thing we have tried to do to mitigate the difficulties in recruiting is use the job-share scheme in some practices.  A contractor might decide to go on reduced time in later years before they retire.  Another doctor comes in and eventually takes on the practice.  In the two or three cases where we have done that, it has been quite successful.  It is a bit different to the assistant with a view to partnership.  <\/p> <p>  The challenge in relation to GP recruitment will not become more level or ironed out until the contract issues have concluded.  That is being attended to by the Minister and the Department and negotiations are ongoing.  <\/p> <p>  We have tried to expand the range of supports available to GPs.  The Chairman will be very familiar with the Shannondoc system in the mid-west area.  It was originally intended as an out-of-hours emergency service and is effectively an extended day's service in terms of people's expectations.  There are more than 100,000 contacts to that service annually.  Luckily, we have been able to provide additional supports.  The Chairman is a particularly strong supporter of the community intervention team.  Last year in the mid-west, GPs alone made 290 referrals to the community intervention team as distinct from sending people to hospital.  That is one small snapshot of its work.<\/p> <p>  That is the direction in which things are going but I would not dispute that GP recruitment is very challenged.  We are probably somewhat more fortunate in the mid-west in how the numbers have fallen but we are challenged.<\/p> <p>  Senator Swanick, who had to leave, made particular reference to the use of district hospitals or community nursing units.  Between us, my eight colleagues across the country and I have 7,002 public beds and 1,982 of those are used as short-stay beds.  All of them, other than those used for people coming in from home for respite, are predominantly associated with hospital flow of one type or another whether it is rehabilitation, step-down, transition and so on.  Some 5,020 of them are in the long-stay system.  We are very committed to the community nursing unit system.  The Senator might be familiar with the Government commitment to the refurbishment programme or the new build programme for which the regulations were amended to take us to 2021.  There is in excess of &euro;500 million being spent to enhance that sector.  The public community nursing units are very much a feature of our plans for the future.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked a specific question so as not to misunderstand my intervention in respect of Deputy Donnelly's point.  For clarity, I was not necessarily arguing that Deputy Donnelly's observations on international comparators were in any way out of kilter.  To be fair, he was relying on the capacity review for much of it.  The point I was trying to make was that in the Irish context, while we have a younger population in some respects, one must look at the health status of the older population.  Life expectancy is above the EU average in Ireland because fewer people are dying from circulatory and other diseases because of advances in medicine.<\/p><p>It does not mean that people do not have those diseases and, indeed, they have dependencies on the healthcare system as a result.  That is why this year, we will deliver very high concentrations of support to older people in hospitals and the community, such as more than 17 million home support hours.  It is not as simple as noting Ireland's young population compared with other countries and asking why things are different here.  The status of our population and, in particular, the fact that 65% of those over 65 years of age have at least two chronic conditions, as members are aware, creates significant dependencies on every part of the healthcare system.<\/p><p>  On the use of primary care centres, we are always looking for ways to encourage people to utilise what is available to them in the community.  <\/p><p> Ms Cowan will address the issue raised by Deputy O'Connell in regard to the model used in Kilkenny.  I am aware that general practitioners in the mid-west are fortunate to have other routes available to them, such as an acute medical assessment unit, a surgical assessment unit, a bed bureau and so on.<\/p><p> On step-down facilities, Deputy O'Connell referred to Mount Carmel Community Hospital.  A very successful initiative was introduced for the winter of 2016-17, repeated in 2017-18 and effectively is now an all-year-round system.  It is a transition care system that allows people to convalesce or be cared for outside an acute hospital while, for example, awaiting the completion of their fair deal process.  We have had some very good successes in that regard and the system now runs throughout the year.  Approximately &euro;2.5 million per month is spent on it and over 200 cases per week are approved, each of which has an average length of stay in transitional care of 22 days.  Were it not for the scheme, those patients would be likely to spend that time in the acute system.  Deputy O'Connell rightly referred to care plan and consent issues in that regard.  Some hospitals use the transition care system more than others.  Limerick is the highest and best user of the transitional care system.  It is a very effective intervention and we probably will have to sustain it long into the future.  To go back to Deputy O'Connell's point, we must also try to work with people on consent and care plans, which is not always easy for many reasons to do with families and choice and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked what proportion of the 8,000 reduction in the number of inpatient procedures is accounted for by validation of lists.  A level of activity underpins that change in the waiting list.  I will revert to the committee with further details on the changes since last year.  Since the start of this year, 54,000 people have been added to the list and 57,000 removed.  That is the result of both HSE activity, which includes an element of validation, and NTPF activity.  The 8,000 is the net result in terms of the waiting list.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the elective procedures targeted by the NTPF and whether that is being done on an inpatient day case basis.  The inpatient day case action plan we published in April set out seven high-volume procedures to be targeted, namely, cataracts, hip and knee replacements, varicose veins, tonsils, cysts, coronary angiograms and the excision of lesions.  An eighth category, gastrointestinal, GI, scopes, is slightly outside that grouping.  In addition, the NTPF set aside funding for those waiting more than 18 months for a procedure.  As mentioned, there is funding to enable hospitals to bring forward proposals to address specific waiting list challenges they face.  The NTPF delivers the seven high-volume procedures, GI scopes and a range of other procedures.  It has more than doubled the number of procedures it offers through the private sector from approximately 20 last year to 50.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan referred to the length of time people wait for outpatient appointments.  We have already touched on some of the initiatives under way.  There has been much discussion of validation, which is a critical part of the system to ensure we have accurate lists to help with planning.  Several members questioned the style and form that would take, such as, for example, patients having seven days' notice or being required to confirm by phone.  Such queries indicate the rationale for the establishment of a centralised validation office, namely, that we will learn from best practice and that a standard approach led by the NTPF will be taken to the validation of waiting lists across the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bolger"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>My specific question on the validation of lists regarded the obvious decrease in the waiting list number as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#T00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bolger"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>What element of that decrease results from the identification of persons who no longer require treatment as opposed to having been treated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#T00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I do not have the figures in that regard from last July to now but I can revert to the committee with that detail.

In my earlier responses, I made the point that the NTPF is a statutory body.  Its function is to assess the price and it has a commissioning body in place to that end.  We have a governance structure in place to manage that statutory body.  There is no passing of the buck.  It is clear that the NTPF has statutory responsibility for pricing but we have a clear governance structure for its management.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell also asked about the range of reforms required.  The capacity review contains several scenarios, two of which are very stark.  One concerns the introduction of a very extensive range of reforms, all of which are set out in the capacity review, and a subsequent requirement for 2,600 additional beds.  The capacity review also points out that issues in terms of staffing and planning were not considered but it highlights future work that must be carried out and the reform programme that must be undertaken in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.

We are looking at 94% occupancy at the moment across the hospital system.  We are trying to bring it down to the international norm, which is approximately 85% occupancy.  To do that we would need to inject an additional 1,200 beds immediately.  The HSE has come forward with proposals which it developed, having consulted intensively with hospitals and carried out rapid analyses of demand and capacity.<\/p> <p>  I can give the committee a rough number for acute beds.  There are potentially 600 beds and just under 300 community beds.  The process is under deliberation at the moment and validation is ongoing, meaning the number may change as the process evolves.<\/p> <p>  The modular programme is a significant element of the capacity plan.  The Minister wants to fast-track the delivery of these beds but there is a lead-in time for the construction of modular beds of between 12 and 16 months from the point approval has been given.  It is important that all available mechanisms are used to ensure there are no bottlenecks or delays and Clonmel has been mentioned as a good example of where there have been delays.<\/p> <p>  A number of members referred to additional capacity.  There is a need for reform in this area and the HSE is looking at a more integrated approach to patient care, in particular identifying a need to strengthen clinical interventions to improve care pathways, specifically around rolling out the acute floor model, strengthening palliative care in emergency departments, old person's frailty and reablement teams, and measures to support infection control, which was a major issue last winter.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gloster spoke about delayed discharges and initiatives to support people returning home, including the winter initiative.

We used to reconcile them with the INMO to provide the information to the public.  The effect on flu and planning electives this year was significant, with 4,800 admissions relating to flu where there had only been 1,500 in the previous year.  We know, as everybody does, that the flu comes annually but the scale of the impact was high and it was a mixed strain, which brought its own complexity.<\/p> <p>  We can count all the electives as we see all the cases performed through the patient administration systems and the HIPE records which we have.  I was asked about cancelling.  Many hospitals do not book in January or February but their systems track what is done and what is cancelled.

I am seeking clarification on this and will provide it to the Senator when I get it.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question about CAMHS access, which we discussed earlier.  The Deputy made a proposal relating to a 24-hour access number for GPs and I will refer the query to our mental health services.  There was a query about community and district hospitals, which Mr. Gloster addressed, and the GP contract.  Another question was on the modular unit in Mayo and Deputy Kelly had a further query about the history of that.  There were proposals in Mayo and a theatre proposal in Galway, which involves replacing an orthopaedic theatre and which is proceeding.  Clonmel is the first example of additional capacity proposed for this tranche of modular builds but there are others on the table, which are the subject of deliberations with Government.  As for the decision-making process, the creation of the idea is local, having come from the local hospital group in Clonmel.  The decision-making process is subject to funding but this has been resolved in the case of Clonmel.  It involves the HSE leadership team and directorate on expenditure over certain limits.

On any audit of the system of referral, to answer the Deputy's point the NTPF audits waiting list processes from time to time and consequently, there is an audit.  We have dealt with the age profile point.  The Deputy asked about how many facilities are down at any one time, perhaps referring to the opportunity to use more intensively theatre and other facilities that are available but not in use, potentially at night and the like.  A theatre productivity programme has been undertaken in the HSE to ensure we get optimum capacity but it also extends into working day and bed capacity.  Clearly, doing more operations requires more beds and more staff.  That ties into the capacity dialogue on the 2,600 beds.  The Deputy referred to performance at hospital level being an issue, and that is true.  There are variations.  This touches on Deputy Donnelly's question.  On competition among providers being a good thing, that was a view.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell raised the retention of graduates and asked why retention of graduates was improving.

The most important issue with graduate nurses is to capture them before they leave the country.  In previous years we were slow at that and the young graduates would go to the UK and other places very quickly.  The UK would send people here to interview them.  We have put a process in place now.  They are upwardly mobile young people who want to travel the world at some point in their career.  We offer them permanent contracts with opportunities to take a career break within them.  In the past week, three of them have contacted University Limerick hospitals group to come back from their travels after their career breaks.  At least we are ensuring they will come back to a post here.  From talking to intern students and having the personal history of students qualifying, they would say they are wary of permanent contracts but they will take them if they are offered.  They are not interested in going straight into higher diploma education because they have just finished four years in college but they will do it two years' hence.  They have a big problem with accommodation.  They cannot get accommodation when they qualify or they cannot afford accommodation and they cannot travel from home because they cannot get access to transport in rural areas or they cannot get a driver test.  These are clear problems for these young people, as I am sure they are in other sectors.<\/p> <p>  When we surveyed them they said they needed support when they come onto the floor and training to deal with the real front-line pressures.  That is what turns them off sometimes and makes them leave the country.  They need support to deal with public expectation because they are the first point of contact when people are under pressure.  Also, there is a professional expectation of them and, in my view, one must mind them for the first 12 months and then offer them the higher diplomas or whatever they wish to do.  They do not know in the first year after they come out of college into what they wish to expand.  I believe we must incentivise them to stay through accommodation, transport and the like.  That is not just nurses but professionals at every level in the country.  As I said earlier, there is the same issue with trying to attract consultants back into the country.  We need to make some other offering to get them to come back and work in our services.  That will solve the waiting lists, theatre problems, opening of beds and so forth because our own staff will be retained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Cowan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>To finish, Chairman, there was a further question about the Smithfield local injuries unit from Deputy O'Connell, which is associated with the Mater Hospital.  The Deputy correctly said it is very popular and is growing its volumes.  In fact, the level of referrals now to local injury units nationally is 94,000 per year, so there is a strong growth in attendances at those units.  That is true of Gurranabraher in Cork, where there is a unit on the hill.  People do not know about this so we ran a social media campaign for local injury units last winter, which was very successful.  It brought many patients to the units.  We will continue to do that.  On the issue of culture and awareness, the Deputy is right that many people still believe they need to go to the Mater Hospital rather than to the local injuries unit but that is changing and GPs have responded very positively to the extension of hours in Smithfield.  Regarding the notion that the Mater Hospital ED is taking a specific additional burden of work arising from the work of the local injuries unit, the EDs in the area are all growing, including that of the Mater Hospital.  There is no specific evidence that would say it is growing disproportionately more.  As there are local injuries units of various types associated with St. James's Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and others, that facility is available elsewhere although the Smithfield one is a fine facility.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if the HSE or the hospitals overbook outpatients.  It is true that part of the booking practice is an awareness that people will not show up but there are also opportunities for us to use the available space more productively.  However, the statement is correct.  The Deputy referred to the roll-out of texting and said that somebody could do that over a weekend.  The HSE must be cautious in terms of our general data protection regulation, GDPR, responsibilities and general data protection and be sensitive to consent issues with patients but within that context, we wish to use electronic means.  We would like to have an electronic health record online for a patient, so clearly that is something we want to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":322,"content":"<p>With regard to the 477,000 no shows, how many of those are first visits and how many are repeat or roll-over visits where they come back in six months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#V00700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will have to refer back to you on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#V00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Can we get a figure for it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#V00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#V01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I do not believe there was the same trouble recruiting at the height of the property bubble.  There is more at play than simply the cost of living.  I believe it is the conditions in which the nurses and every other grade are working that are contributing to making the HSE an unattractive place for people to work.  That is the observation.<\/p> <p>  I had to return to my office to do some work and I was contacted by somebody from Roscommon who was watching these proceedings.  The person is obviously very interested in the capacity issue because there are currently 12 people affected by a closed nursing home.  He referred to delayed discharges.  Obviously, opening beds and step-down and care of the elderly beds in the community is central to dealing with the delayed discharges problem.  I will put to the witnesses the question that was put to me.  Is it not somewhat counter-intuitive to close nursing home beds, as is happening in the case of the Rosalie unit in Castlerea?  The HSE is closing beds on one hand while on the other, it is complaining, rightly, about delayed discharges.  Nobody wants to have delayed discharges and we certainly do not like using the terminology that was used previously to describe those people.  The person asked me whether there is a plan for those 12 people in the first instance.  Also, how does one square that with what is now being called the capacity dialogue?  It used to be the capacity piece.  It was the piece and now it is the dialogue.  How does the capacity dialogue in which we are all so enthusiastically and energetically engaged fit with saying on the one hand that we need to increase capacity, which we all recognise is true, and on the other, we are closing down the very beds those people should be able to access?  It appears to be counter-intuitive.<\/p> <p>  Thank you, Chairman, for allowing me to speak again.

I have a few questions.  The first concerns University Hospital Galway and the spinal unit there.  I will read the witnesses a line of correspondence from a senior consultant there: &quot;As you know, our ability to access major elective spinal surgery in the University Hospital has virtually come to a halt due to the lack of resource allocation.&quot;  What is being done to give the hospital the resources it needs in order to be able to carry out vital spinal surgeries?  At the end of the list there are people who have been in excruciating pain for a number of years and are absolutely at their wits' end.  If University Hospital Galway cannot do it, is there somewhere else across the Border or abroad where the surgery can be done?  Can someone within the hospital system find a pathway or say, &quot;The buck stops with me and I will find a way to take this person, or however many people, out of the excruciating pain with which they must live every day&quot;?  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is not an option because it states in the correspondence:<\/p><blockquote>Regrettably, the spinal service is not in a position to give me a date or a review of surgery at this time.  The man is not suitable for referral to the National Treatment Purchase Fund or referral to a private hospital due to the complex surgery needs.<\/blockquote> <p>We cannot just leave such people in excruciating pain and do nothing about it.  Judging from what is being presented here, one would hardly think we have a system that is almost the worst in Europe.  Every time we have personnel from the HSE before us, in committee and otherwise, they paint this picture that everything is happening and things will get better and better, yet we see that things are getting worse all the time.  Reference was made earlier to shifting the deckchairs around on the <i>Titanic<\/i>, and that is certainly my view of the matter as well.<\/p><p>I really must take up the issue of nursing.  I spoke to a number of nurses who live in Birmingham over the weekend and asked them why they do not come back to work within the system here.  They are not a protected species and they do not need to be minded.  The nurses I know certainly do not.  What they want is a safe working environment.  They say the Irish health system is too high-risk.  They wonder what will happen if they go into a high-risk situation.  They will be trying to do the work of three or four people.  They wonder what will happen if they make mistakes and who will have their backs if they make mistakes and lose their licences.  That is what they are trying to weigh up, rather than some of the things Ms Cowan mentioned, which may be concerns of a lesser degree.  What our nurses deserve is to be provided with a safe working environment.  There is a real crisis within nursing and recruitment.  The nurses also say the recruitment process is just too complex and that there are too many blockages along the way.  Can the HSE simplify that process?  If people have the qualifications and experience to do the job, they should be put into that setting and let work in their own country because people have a right to do that.<\/p><p>I think Mr. Gloster said &euro;500 million is to be spent on district hospital beds.  Will he tell me how many beds this will equate to and perhaps where they will be?

We always refer to our own cases.  Half of the 20 beds in Belmullet District Hospital were closed down due to the wisdom of someone within the HSE and what was the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time, even though we stated it would be a major mistake.  Now there are people in Mayo University Hospital whose wish is to be cared for within the district hospital setting.  What are the major hold-ups here?  If &euro;500 million is available, what are the blockages that need to be unblocked?  Perhaps the witnesses might explain that for us.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the missed appointments, one of the biggest problems people have is where services are moved - say, to Galway Hospital.  I am all for a centre of excellence but also that the other services be provided on the ground.  Obviously, the HSE needs the integrated appointments system as well.  People do not have the transport, so the public transport is not there to match up with their appointment times.  If someone is living on &euro;188 or &euro;200 per week, to get a private operator or individual to bring him or her from, say, Erris to Galway is just way above and beyond his or her means, and this needs to be looked into as well.  We had Bus &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority before us last week, and this is one of the questions we asked, yet they close down routes all the time that connect to the hospitals and the transport connectivity is not there.  I think the HSE has a role in this.  Actually, they cited that the HSE's response in terms of having a proper integrated transport system was dismal and certainly not consistent.<\/p> <p>  If we are to solve the problem within the HSE long term, we need to look at the education system.  We have a whole cohort of young people doing their leaving certificate this year.  They must go through the health professions admission test, HPAT.  Obviously, there must be standards, but for people choosing to go down the medical route who are 18 and 19 years of age, that passage needs to be made easier for them.  It is not about lowering standards but about the fact that young people who would make excellent doctors and who have a real sense of social justice, equality and fairness are not just driven and motivated by money.  What communications do the witnesses have with the Department of Education and Skills in having a real look at the long-term recruitment and long-term education that is needed to give us the numbers of consultants, doctors and so on that we need within the health service?<\/p><p>When will we see a proper, purpose-built hospital at Merlin Park?

I am very familiar with the Rosalie unit because three years ago I spent nine months there covering as the chief officer, and it was quite a hot topic then.  Essentially, the Rosalie unit had developed into a quasi-type of later life psychiatry or mental health facility.  Given their advancing years, many of the residents who utilised the unit at the time were identified as quite possibly being within the remit of nursing home care.  This led to a lot of discourse that the unit was maybe going to close and so on.  During the time that I was involved I gave an indication that while I did not believe the evidence would support the unit's retention or continued use for psychiatry of later life, it quite possibly might have a role in the context of older persons' services and care generally.  To be fair, I do not want to commit my colleague to something he cannot do, or to undermine his position.  When the Deputy raised this point I sent him a text and he has assured me that no decision has been made yet on the unit.  I believe there is quite a bit of narrative around it because I am aware that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice have both spoken on the issue.

It is proposed to build 75 beds on the site.  They are replacements for the existing long-stay beds.  I believe there was some confusion that they may be additional beds.  They are replacement beds because of the regulations, which are inspected by HIQA.  In terms of progress, I am told by the estates department that the pre-planning discussion will happen over the summer and a formal planning application will be made by the end of the summer.  It will probably run on for longer than an average planning application because there is quite a lot involved and because of the nature of the site.  It is hoped to put a spade in the ground in 2018, and to have the project completed well before the regulation deadline of end of 2021.

This investment programme in public, elderly residential care units is not for additional capacity but for replacement capacity.

On the margins we could lose two or three beds in places, or we could gain.  The difficulty with that programme is that it was announced by the then outgoing Government in February 2016.  We are experiencing some challenges as we progress through the programme now because of increasing costs in construction since that announcement.  This will have to wash through, but we are in very close negotiations and discussions on this with the Department.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to closures of some beds, and while I do not know specifically about the Belmullet facility I am aware that in my own facilities in the mid-west two things happened that essentially saw some reduction in the numbers of beds in public units.  The first issue was that up to 2011 we were continuing to count the very old historical number of beds.  Even though the beds were physically there they had not been used for quite some time.  We recalibrated the system to give a more accurate count of open beds from 2011 on.  Where units lost beds it was because the site itself was being refurbished.  The regulations and regulatory requirements from HIQA is very high in the built environment and the amended regulations to allow us to continue up to 2021 only came about in 2016.  Before 2016, therefore, there were some regulatory pressures that led to some bed closures.  When our maintenance people go in to rebuild wards some capacity could be lost in the existing sites.<\/p> <p>  The other reason that bed closures could be experienced in community nursing units is not dissimilar to bed closures in acute hospitals, which is the workforce issue.  In different parts of the State we are very challenged in terms of recruiting the workforce we need for those facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#X01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Was any of it in order to save money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#X01100","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I am certainly not aware of the detail for bed closures in the Belmullet unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#X01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>It was across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#X01300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>In my own area of the mid-west I have more than 500 public beds and I have not closed any of them due to money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018070400002#X01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>It is a pity Mr. Gloster was not in Mayo.

Accompanying me is my colleague, Neil Maher, assistant principal officer in the rental market unit in the Department.<\/p> <p>  Regulations setting out minimum standards for private rented accommodation generally were first set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993.  However, a number of changes have been made to the regulatory framework since 2008 to reflect the requirements of a modern rental sector.  The current minimum standards for rental accommodation prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 were introduced in July 2017.  The purpose of the regulations is to provide residential rental accommodation that is safe, efficient, durable and comfortable.  These regulations specify minimum health and safety requirements across a range of matters, including fire, structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, safety of gas and electricity supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure their rented properties comply with the regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority.<\/p> <p>  The sector faces a number of serious challenges in regard to the minimum standards, including the low rate of inspection, high numbers of non-compliant properties, inconsistencies with interpretation and application of the standards and guidelines, and lack of follow up and enforcement action.  The strategy for the rental sector recognises high-quality rental accommodation is critical to the success and sustainability of the residential rental sector and its attractiveness as a long-term accommodation option for households.  It sets out a number of important actions to ensure the safety and quality of rented accommodation, by bringing rental standards up to date and strengthening processes for inspection and compliance.  <\/p> <p>  A review of the standards was conducted in 2016.  The aim was to ensure that the applicable standards reflect requirements of a modern rental market, contribute to delivery of high-quality housing and provide increased protection for tenants by addressing critical health and safety concerns, with particular focus on three main areas: to introduce changes to existing provisions in order to reinforce them and to include additional provisions not already covered; to strengthen local authority implementation through closer collaboration, co-operation and dissemination of best practice; and to focus on increasing awareness around the minimum standards.<\/p> <p>  The Department published comprehensive guidelines in August 2017 to assist and support local authorities in implementing the regulations.  To increase the numbers of properties inspected, specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity has been identified from 2018 with annual targets for both inspection and compliance agreed with local authorities.  The objective is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year with the aim of achieving a 25% annual inspection coverage rate by 2021.<\/p> <p>  A rental standards working group was established in 2017 to develop proposals and make recommendations to give effect to the actions related to standards under the rental strategy.  Three specialist subgroups are being established, including an IT subgroup to develop and roll out a national standardised IT system, and to develop or purchase software solutions to upgrade from current spreadsheets and Word systems in the short term; a training subgroup to develop and implement a training programme for enforcement officers, and host an annual seminar to share knowledge, best practice and to support continuous professional development; and a human resources subgroup to examine, make recommendations and secure agreement on all other HR aspects, including annual inspection targets, staff numbers, grading structure, funding, qualifications, legal services and so on.<\/p> <p>  Since establishment of the Residential Tenancy Board, RTB, more than &euro;36 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts with more than 229,000 inspections carried out.<\/p> <p>However, additional resources need to be provided to local authorities to facilitate increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance.  Provision has been made for an allocation of &euro;2.5 million in 2018, with further increases proposed each year up to 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Department recently issued letters to local authorities outlining the reforms and improvements envisioned for rental properties under the strategy.  The letters set out annual targets and requested each local authority to prepare an implementation plan to achieve them, including details about staffing, resources and other needs that will be required.  Individual implementation plans have now been received and are being examined prior to engaging directly with the local authorities concerned with a view to finalising and assisting with implementation and delivery.  Opportunities for delivering the inspectorate function on a shared basis, for example, legal services, will also be explored and implemented as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee again for giving the Department this opportunity to discuss accommodation standards for the rental sector.  I look forward to discussing this in more detail now with the committee.  I reiterate the Department's commitment to continue to prioritise and deliver on this important area.

I am accompanied today by my colleague, Janette Fogarty, assistant director with responsibility for dispute resolution services.  As the committee is aware, the RTB is not directly responsible for the inspection and enforcement of standards in the rental sector.  However, as the national public body set up to support and develop a well-functioning rental sector in Ireland, the RTB has, within its broader remit, an important role to play in the quality and standard of rental homes.  I will set out the RTB's role in relation to standards and further issues for consideration.<\/p> <p>  The RTB has 340,000 tenancies registered representing 174,000 landlords and 705,000 occupants.  With regard to regulating minimum standards in the sector, the RTB has a number of roles.  Since 2004, the RTB has provided funding to local authorities at the direction of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to enable them to meet the cost of inspections of private rented accommodation.  The total money distributed to date is more &euro;34.5 million, with &euro;1.7 million provided in 2017.  Traditionally, one-fifth, or 20%, of the RTB registration fee income was ring-fenced for inspections.  However, this was suspended from 1 July 2016 in light of the RTB&rsquo;s decreasing registration income.  Despite this suspension the RTB had already set aside funding from previous years in a trustee capacity for inspections, and another &euro;1.2 million remains available to be drawn down for inspections in the RTB funds.<\/p> <p>  The RTB also has an important role in relation to standards arising from its dispute resolution function.  In addition to the standards for rented housing regulations, there are obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act for landlords to comply with the rental standards and also to carry out all necessary repairs and replacements to rented dwellings.  This means that a tenant can refer a dispute to the RTB in relation to the standards and maintenance of the dwelling or breach of landlord obligations or responsibilities.  In 2017, 603 cases relating to the standard and maintenance of dwellings were received by the RTB.  The nature of these cases vary and range from issues such as mould, damp and pest control to appliances in need of repair or replacement and issues of heating.<\/p><p>To facilitate the local authority inspection programmes to enforce minimum standards, the RTB shares data on registered tenancies and associated details to local authorities on a periodic basis.  <\/p><p> As the primary regulator in the sector, the RTB wants to play its role in ensuring a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspection and enforcement process across local authorities.  In this regard, there are opportunities to enhance both the RTB and local authority role in data sharing to improve regulation of the rental sector from both a standards and a registration perspective.  As a member of the departmental working group on rental standards, the RTB is exploring opportunities to use its capacity around data intelligence to ensure better compliance with minimum standards and the broader regulatory framework.  <\/p><p> As a national body with a national database of tenancies, one of the most important roles of the RTB involves education and awareness.  We have a broad reach, which allows for consistency of messaging on important issues.  In August 2017, following the tragic fire in Grenfell Tower in London, the RTB issued correspondence and an information leaflet to 175,000 landlords to raise awareness of fire safety and the updated minimum standards for rented accommodation. The RTB has also been rolling out targeted campaigns on social media over the past number of months with engagement from local authorities and fire authorities.  <\/p><p> The RTB is developing a voluntary landlord accreditation scheme to support landlords to comply with their responsibilities and to increase professionalism within the sector.  A key part of the scheme will be to raise awareness and encourage best practice in the management of the homes landlords are providing, including an overview of minimum standards and landlords' obligations with regard to these.  The RTB believes that as the accreditation model matures, there is potential for it to be used as a certificate of compliance across all regulatory areas.<\/p><p> To conclude, the issue of minimum standards in rental accommodation is very important.  For tenants and their families who are living in poor-quality, unsafe or substandard accommodation, this can have a serious and detrimental impact on their lives.  From our perspective, there are two issues to be addressed.  First, we need further education and awareness with a consistent approach at a national level to inform landlords and tenants of their rights and obligations.  Second, we need to work in partnership and develop better ways of reporting to deal with the very serious issues of overcrowding in rental homes that are below standard or dangerous.  It is the RTB's view that we need to find a way to differentiate between these very serious cases and other cases of non-compliance that can be dealt with by working with the relevant parties through education and awareness.  At present, our reporting system and regulatory framework does not differentiate between the two and it is important that we have an accurate understanding of the actual levels of non-compliance in the sector and the level of seriousness.  The RTB is on the working group on rental standards and is supportive of increased inspections of rental accommodation.  We are committed to working together in partnership across regulatory areas in a more cohesive manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I now call on Dr. Hayden to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#E00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank members for inviting Threshold to appear before it and give its input on standards in private rented accommodation.  I am accompanied by our chief executive officer, CEO, Mr. John-Mark McCafferty, and our legal officer, Mr. Gavin Elliott.  Threshold was founded in 1978.  We are a national housing charity whose aim is to secure a right to housing, particularly for households experiencing poverty and social exclusion.<\/p> <p>  Threshold's input to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government's discussion on this issue comprises the following: an examination of poor standards in the sector drawing on case studies from clients accessing our services; consideration of enforcement and inspections; Threshold's policy on an \"NCT\" for housing, how it would work, the benefits to the State and the pitfalls of self-certification, defining and dealing with overcrowding and dealing with openness and transparency.  <\/p> <p>  In our opinion, the Government can no longer shy away from its commitment to provide quality housing and adequate standards for those in housing need and to ensure minimum standards are strictly adhered to in the private rented market.  Inadequate physical standards consistently rank as one of the top complaints raised by clients with Threshold.  I will provide a number of examples - as we all know, we have had a very difficult winter - of not untypical cases presented to Threshold on a daily basis.  Such cases include that of an expectant mother living with two young children in accommodation that is heated inadequately through two small electric heaters, a couple and their two children who all sleep in the living room of their home, which is heated through an open fire as long-term problems with the central heating have resulted in cold, damp and mouldy bedrooms and a couple and their premature baby living in a cold and draughty property where the heating and shower are broken and some of the windows do not close properly.  These are just examples of the wide-ranging cases that come to our organisation in respect of minimum standards and their breach.  <\/p> <p>  A significant number of rented properties are substandard and the current system of local authority inspections is failing to enforce the minimum standards required by law.  In the year to date, Threshold has dealt with 585 standards and repairs queries and in 2017, our housing advisers dealt with 1,261 queries relating to standards.  We live in an era in which employees are afforded protection in the workplace by health and safety regulations, diners in a restaurant can expect that the kitchen of the premises is regularly inspected to ensure health and safety standards, road users are obliged to adhere to preventative road safety measures that ensure vehicles on Irish roads are in sound working order and a consumer can insist that a good is \"fit for the purpose\".  Someone looking for a home to rent is a consumer but a potential tenant's familiarity with building standards is limited.  Tenants do not carry a damp meter with them when they go to view a property.  Many tenants are afraid to reject or walk away from a letting, particularly when supply  is so scarce and rent levels are astronomically high.  Few consumer goods more strongly merit protection than a home.  This includes freedom from damp and condensation, proper heating facilities, adequate ventilation and hot and cold running water.  <\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, enforcement and inspection of standards in the private rented sector are recurring concerns for Threshold.  In 2016, the number of dwellings that did not meet regulatory requirements stood at 10,418, which is an increase of 1,978 based on the 2015 figure of 8,440.  More dwellings were inspected in 2008 than were inspected in 2016.  In 2016, legal action was taken in only 16 cases nationwide.  Fourteen of these were concentrated in Dublin.  Within Dublin, South Dublin County Council inspected 1,355 dwellings and Dublin City Council inspected 1,751.  However, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council only managed to inspect 271 dwellings.  In 14 local authorities where dwellings did not comply with standards, zero notices were served on landlords for improvements to be carried.  In our opinion, this represents a failure in the system.  <\/p> <p>  Threshold believes the introduction of a certification scheme or an \"NCT for housing\" is the best approach to address the shortcomings of the current system.  In such a scheme, the burden of proof for compliance with minimum standards should rest with the landlord who should be required to provide a certificate of fitness to the local authority before a property is rented.  The integration of such a scheme with certification requirements relating to energy efficiency, fire safety, tax obligations and registration with the RTB would promote greater compliance in general.  Given the importance of this issue and the historic failure of the policy-making system to respond to this, Threshold recently established an online petition to seek public support for an NCT-type certification system in rented accommodation.  As of late June, the number of signatures is 10,229.  <\/p> <p>  How would a certification system work?  The property would be inspected by an independent and suitably qualified professional, the certificate be displayed in the rented dwelling, a certificate would be valid for a fixed period, the landlord would be required to supply the RTB with the details of certification, the certification scheme could be rolled out on a phased basis and an indicative fee structure could be established that would be affordable for landlords and would be tax-deductible.  <\/p> <p>  What would be the benefits to the State?  The onus would be placed on landlords to prove that they are compliant with the minimum standards.  A prospective tenant would be assured from the beginning that the dwelling complies with all legal requirements.  In our opinion, overall compliance levels would rise.  <\/p> <p>  We do not believe that self-certification is the answer to the current problem of poor standards in the sector.  It relies on landlords being caught and we are all aware this is no deterrent in the current system.  There needs to be sufficient sanction for failure to comply with minimum standards and self-certification is not going to achieve this.  Threshold believes that if car owners cannot self-certify a motor vehicle then rented homes should be no different.  <\/p> <p>  Overcrowding in the private rented sector is a serious issue that is increasingly coming to light through our services.  As a result, we believe it is imperative that a definition of overcrowding for private rented accommodation is inserted into existing minimum standards for accommodation to enable local authorities or a national agency to inspect properties and ensure compliance.<\/p><p>While there are minimum standards covering some aspects of private rented accommodation, the regulations are silent on how many people should occupy the accommodation provided.  Previously a landlord had to state the number of occupants and record the estimated floor space but this obligation was removed by section 62 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, and their inclusion would be useful in terms of measuring overcrowding in order to inform policy.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to raise the issue of openness and transparency.  At the moment there is no openness and transparency in relation to the properties that are inspected.  In our opinion it should be clear and evident from the statistics that the properties that are inspected are those that are most deserving of being inspected in particular, properties that re pre-1963; properties that are more likely to be in breach of minimum standards; and properties where a local authority would be aware of potential shortcomings, as in for the sake of argument, unfortunate situations such as Priory Hall.<\/p><p> Can I thank the committee for their indulgence and for their invitation to appear here today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hayden.

I am joined by my colleague here from Dublin City Council, Mr. Colm Smyth, principal environmental health officer and I will touch on some of the elements of the written statement considering the time issues.<\/p> <p>  First with myself and Mr. Smyth representing Waterford and Dublin respectively, we present a reasonable picture of the largest urban authority and a smaller urban authority in Waterford city, with a significant rural element in terms of the county area.<\/p> <p>  We broadly agree and are working with the Department on the current policy position which is to ramp up inspections as quickly as possible and we see 2021 as being the realistic position for reaching a 25% target in terms of inspections on an annual basis.  We see that being prioritised.  Our general view is that this would be very dependent on the data being generated, if we were to move to a risk-based approach, and a rate of around 20% may well achieve such compliance, as long as it is a targeted risk context.<\/p> <p>  There has been significant improvement over recent years.  I note the Threshold reference to 2016, but the simple reality is that there has been in excess of a 50% increase in 2017.  There will be a further 50% increase in the rate of inspections in the current year.  There is a significant effort and resource going into this issue.  Dublin City Council in the current year have employed 12 additional environmental enforcement officers to ramp up their activities.  In my own instance, where I already had one with back office support, now we have increased that by employing a further inspector.  We would see ourselves as moving to between 15% and 20% of inspections annually by next year.  Right across the county there is a very significant additional resource being provided.  We are working with the Department in terms of the areas that Mr. Dunne would have outlined already, and we will see that bringing about significant improvement.<\/p> <p>  Patently, we would accept the position as outlined by Threshold in some respects that there is an element of contravention and, human nature being what it is, we must strive to get the balance between enforcement and compliance right.  The nature of contraventions vary very significantly, from nominal contraventions, that do not necessarily have a major impact on the living conditions for those tenants occupying the buildings, to things that are more serious, in terms of health and safety or otherwise.  We want to gather this data ultimately and are currently looking to develop an ICT system that can report comprehensively in that context.  We have listed some of the types of contraventions and I will not go through all of them.  It is fair to say that pre-1963 properties are a particular difficulty.  We are also finding difficulty with the most recent regulatory changes in 2017, where in regard to some of the elements provided for in terms of window restrictors or carbon monoxide detection or otherwise, people simply have not caught up with or may or may not be aware of them.  There is certainly a need for the provision of further and continuing information to such landlords.<\/p> <p>  We have outlined a number of improvements that we would intend to achieve in the first instance in our statement and we would equally say there are spaces that we would certainly be open to dialogue on, and on which perhaps the Oireachtas or the Minister have a role in enhancing powers.  <\/p> <p>  It is certain, and I would emphasise this, that the resource base around the inspection regime is very significant and has to be ramped up really significantly if there is going to be impact in this context.<\/p> <p>  At the end of the day, there are a number of choices.  Who then pays for that?  There is the landlord, the State, and the tenant, obviously.  In general terms the landlord suffering these costs will ultimately pass them on to the tenant, which is the reality.  We need to get to a point - which we are not at the moment - where full compliance is the norm.  It is fair to say that the majority of landlords, particularly professional landlords, are compliant.  It is equally the case that there is a minority where compliance is not the norm and the challenge for us, as regulators, is to ensure compliance.  We welcome dialogue about how we get there.  We are seeking continual improvement here and we welcome this committee's consideration of this issue because our common goal is very simple.  We want to ensure we get to a point where compliance is absolutely the norm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan, we can do a five minutes backwards and forwards and then we can go around a second time if we need to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#F00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530693000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I wish to personally thank all of the speakers for their presentations; we have had a look at them and the word that is emerging here is \"partnership\".  Ms Carroll talked about the need for partnership, joined-up thinking and synergy.  Before we proceed, I contacted a number of councils across the country yesterday, as I would do as standard practice before any joint Oireachtas committee meeting on housing, planning and local government.  I would circulate a certain amount of documentation and encourage them to come back and engage - it is one of the things I do.  I received the largest volume of emails from councils and I will cite just three, without naming individuals, and one,  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which was mentioned by the speakers.  Their councillors tell me that the provision for inspection for D&uacute;n Laoghaire is close to 2% of the rental income, approximately 300 of the 15,000 budgeted for.  There is general frustration in Wexford and Meath where the common theme in all of the emails received is that a lot of people come from social housing lists.  They are known and the accommodation has been identified as being unsuitable, with damp, mould etc.  These people have been prioritised for housing.  Yet, within weeks, these same houses that the council have come out and looked at as being not suitable for their housing needs, are filled again with another group of people.  These people are then back on to the council saying, within weeks, there is damp, mildew, mould and the same problems recur.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly thinking of a block in my own area - which I am not going to single out here because I do not think it would be right or proper - which has effectively become a whole ghetto of really bad stuff.  I went into a house the other day where the landlord had divided up one room into a three-room unit, drilled a hole in the wall for an outlet for a shower, and rats were coming up from the manhole.  That is out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  These people - I checked to see where these people went - ended up getting accommodated by the housing authority.  No one is saying \"stop\".  The argument is that there is a crisis and we need accommodation.  People keep getting stuck in this kind of accommodation and we need to address this issue.  Where it has come to a council's attention that accommodation is unsuitable and they have had to move people out of that accommodation, they should immediately have to serve some sort of order or restriction.  That accommodation should be condemned and it should not be rented by other people.<\/p><p>Dr. Hayden's suggestion on an NCT makes sense.  Threshold has been campaigning on tenancies long before anyone else.  This is an initiative that makes common sense.  If one does not get an NCT for one's car, one does not drive the car.  It is as simple as that.<\/p><p> We must be very clear.  The same roles have to apply for social housing.  I accept Mr. Walsh mentioned that in the report.  We have social housing stock that is not fit for purpose.  I have seen letters that were written to tenants asking them to get Domestos, pull the beds out from the walls and wash the walls.  People with asthma and really serious bronchial problems are in accommodation that is not suitable.  Sometimes the entire focus is on the private sector, which I accept needs to be addressed, but the same standards and NCT-like approach should be applied to social housing because we have social housing stock in this country that is not suitable.  I have seen some very unsatisfactory accommodation.  That is an important point to make.<\/p><p> In 2016 the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, devised a strategy for the retail sector and launched Rebuilding Ireland.  Many things were going to happen, including the introduction of a new standard of regulation and increased inspections.  There was reference to coverage, compliance, ring-fencing funding and the development of efficiencies with IT services.  That was all talked about in 2016 and it is now 2018.  Everyone is on the same page.  Everyone wants to get the thing done.  It makes sense for us as a committee to promote an NCT-like approval for housing.  We can discuss it later.  If a property does not reach the standard, it is taken off the market and is not let.  We have had a good discussion today but we need to progress it.  Threshold has set out a very simple model which is doable, practical and easily understood and it is something we should pursue.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#F00600","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his comments.  I think he is right.  We recognise there is a difficulty in standards in private rental accommodation.  The idea of an inspection regime is to have an impact on those standards and to improve them.  Obviously, that is not working.  The incremental strategy is designed to increase the impact and to improve the standards.  We have revised the standards.  The regulations came out in July 2017.  We have issued guidelines to local authorities on how to implement the standards.  We have set up our working groups.  As Senator Boyhan said, a partnership approach is needed.  We are committed to that.  We are committed to increasing inspections, but there are also other areas on which we need to focus.  Education and awareness are very important.  We must make sure each landlord is aware of the standards and the legal obligation he or she has to enforce the standards, and the responsibilities and liabilities they put on them.<\/p> <p>  I will sit down with Threshold and go through the NCT approach with it.  I do not make any commitment but I will consider it.  There are options such as self certification as well as an NCT approach and there might be an option for outsourcing inspections with a certificate at the end of it.  There are plenty of options but I think we can sit down and consider it.  There is a commitment on behalf of the Department going forward to try to increase the inspections.  Part of that approach is to ensure we follow up on enforcement where a property is in serious breach and in serious non-compliance.  Enforcement for landlords who do not take their responsibility seriously will send out a quick message that it is the responsibility of landlords and they have to get in line.  Many landlords do comply and if minor non-compliance is brought to their attention they remedy it very quickly.  I am not attacking all landlords, it is just a cohort that does not seem to accept its responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I will briefly respond to the point made by Senator Boyhan on partnership.  That is the key.  We have a fragmented regulatory structure because we have the local authorities on one side and us on the other and I think there is a lot of room for us to improve that.  We will work in partnership over the next year to try to address that.  It should not matter whether a member of the public refers an issue to us or to a local authority.  We can put systems in place to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the stock coming back in and also to data intelligence.  Mr. Walsh talked about risk-based frameworks.  At the moment, when one sees a list of contraventions, that is all it is; it does not identify what is serious versus what might be a minor infringement.  In terms of targeting the bad stock we must get to a point where we have a red rating to identify the work that needs to be done.  We must put in a framework to address the seriousness of the various issues.<\/p> <p>  At the moment we are developing a landlord accreditation scheme.  The idea behind it is to look at landlords in their overall responsibility.  We want them to be able to say they have done a course which says they know not just about the standards but about everything they should be doing and that they would do an exam at the end of it.  We think there is potential for the NCT to be pulled in as part of that.  There is a lot of potential in that model which we are piloting at the moment.

I completely agree with his comments on social housing.  There is a major issue there in terms of the funding of the maintenance of social housing.  We are well aware that an awful lot of what happens in social housing is reactive maintenance.  In most local authorities there has not been a stock condition survey since the early 2000s, so we have a major issue with the quality of social housing.  A lot of people do not seem to realise that the standards for rented housing also apply to social housing and there is an issue there that must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  On inspections, it is our experience that a lot of local authorities do reactive inspections.  In other words, they inspect HAP properties, for example, or they inspect where there are complaints, rather than having a proactive inspection programme.  In terms of resources, I completely agree, the inspection system has to be properly resourced.  We have to also accept that there are some local authorities that will not have the resources, in particular smaller local authorities.  The shared services model needs to be investigated.  We see, for example, the shared services model operating very well in relation to HAP with Limerick city and county councils.  There is room to look at that model to a greater extent.<\/p> <p>  I thank Senator Boyhan for his support for the NCT system.  In terms of the partnership model, in our opinion the NCT system works complementarily with the current inspection system, which places the onus on the local authority to prove a landlord does not meet the standards and it is a multi-stage process in many instances.  The advantage of a certification system is that one has to have it from the very beginning before one is entitled to rent property.  There is really no difference between it and a partnership process but what we propose would make it easier rather than more difficult for local authorities to fulfil their function.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the issue of properties not meeting standards on a consistent basis, I do not wish to be negative towards some local authorities, but there is a very big difference between them.  We are aware of some local authorities that do inspections in a brand new apartment block, carry out inspections on a selection of ten apartments and tick a box for 300 inspections.  I compliment Mr. Smyth who is here with us today for the intensified inspection programme Dublin City Council carried out between the canals, which specifically targeted pre-1963 properties that were known to be in multiple occupancy and were far more likely not to meet minimum standards.  It is very important that we do have an open and transparent system when it comes to inspections.  One of the advantages of an NCT-self certification system is quite simply that when a landlord is registering a property with the RTB, as he or she is legally obliged to do, and he or she does not present a certificate of compliance when the property is registered, clearly, one has a breach.  The bottom line is that one can focus on those landlords who are outside of the sector, because if they are outside of the sector in relation to compliance on one level, we know from experience they will be outside the sector in compliance with everything else, be it fire safety, tax or overcrowding.  No matter what it is, non-compliance in one area generally signifies non-compliance in another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>We are legally obliged to meet minimum rental standards for social housing.  We are seeking to achieve them and looking to move to a planned maintenance and inspection regime.  That is a dialogue that is happening with a separate section of the Department to that of Mr. Dunne and Mr. Maher.  There is certainly distinct movement in that space.  However, sometimes the political system is a little ambiguous in it.  The simple reality is that there is tolerance of any increase in any context in the resource base, through rent increases or otherwise.  There is as a consequence a risk of a diminution of overall standards.  In other words, everything will meet the minimum standards, as distinct from the other way around.  That is a challenge for us because, as local authorities, we want to push up our level of service, but in some respects that comes at a cost.  Generally, there is no reflection of this in the income base.<br\/><br\/>Equally, on investing in our houses generally at a policy level, there is a matter for the Oireachtas and the Minister to consider.  In reality, our current policy is that we build houses and within a relatively short period we give them away on a subsidised basis by way of tenant purchase schemes and otherwise.  From a policy perspective, investment in an asset that a tenant is entitled to purchase and that will, therefore, be taken from the local authority in the future is not terribly rational.  That is all I will say in that context.  <br\/><br\/>I consider the social housing function as being slightly separate.  I take the speaker's point to some degree in the context of the local authority housing properties that were mentioned.  However, there are different functions.  Housing inspections are generally all made within one Department, but the scheme of letting priorities prescribes the circumstances in which a house is to be let in any individual local authority area.  As such, it may be that somebody is housed because of the scale of the property required relative to family size or because of any number of other circumstances, as distinct from meeting minimum standards.  I do not think one can align the two directly, although I am not denying the essence of the point.  However, first, we have to adhere to the scheme of letting priorities.  On the other hand, I take the point that perhaps there should be clearer communication that a property needs to be inspected if issues are identified.  I can only speak for my local authority, but I know this to be the case - any arm of our organisation that becomes aware of an issue in a rental property brings it to the attention of the inspectors and <i>vice versa.  <\/i>If there is a serious fire standards contravention, for example, we bring it to the attention of the fire officers who, if necessary, can act under the Fire Services Acts.  I am not saying that is absolutely uniform, but it is the space to which we are getting.  I do not know if Mr. Smyth wishes to comment on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I agree that enforcement is the key and that it has to be balanced between being proactive and reactive.  Creating risk profiles of properties that are more likely to be non-compliant, which is what we did under the intensified inspection programme, is labour and resource-intensive, but it does actually get results in the long term.  It can be a long-term undertaking.  For our part, within Dublin City Council we have set up a private rented unit to give a corporate response on properties that are inspected.  This means that there is improved joined-up thinking and inspections between planning enforcement, housing standards enforcement and fire safety standards enforcement.  They are better co-ordinated, certainly within Dublin City Council, and I presume that is the case within local authorities across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for the presentations.  It is eight months since the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates - Nightmare to Let\" documentary was broadcast and the D&aacute;il unanimously supported a motion, of which one of the central recommendations was the introduction of a system analogous to the national car test, NCT.  While the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme obviously showed the very extreme end - nobody is saying that is the reality for the vast majority of those of us who live in the private rental sector - we do have a difficulty.  I understand what Mr. Walsh says.  He believes the vast majority of landlords are compliant, but the problem is that we do not know that to be the case.  That is not me giving landlords a hard time; it is the very opposite, in fact.  The issue is we do not have data to confirm it.  I think most of us who engage with the private rental sector a lot are of the same view - we just do not know.  For example, the data available to us, limited though they are because some of them are a little dated, show that when one looks at the relationship between levels of inspections and levels of compliance, there is actually a far higher level of compliance than some people think.  Mr. Walsh is right that there is a spectrum.  There is very minor non-compliance which can be rectified very quickly, while there is very extreme non-compliance.  We need to be very honest with ourselves in getting a read on what is happening.<\/p> <p>  I do not understand why it is going to take us until 2021 to get to a 25% inspection rate.  In the first instance, that is a matter directed towards the Minister and the Department.  If it is only going to cost &euro;10 million over four years to bring up staffing levels, I do not see why that &euro;10 million could not be made available, given the fiscal space that will be available next year.  The issue is whether local authorities could ramp up inspection rates to 25% in one year, particularly those that are at the bottom end of the inspection regime. with an inspection rate of 1%, 2% or 3%.  The 2016 report of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC - again, the data are old - showed a large number of local authorities that were already at a figure of 10%, including Mr. Walsh's.  To move from 10% to 25% might be more possible in a year or two years.  If the Minister was to make a policy decision that &euro;10 million would be made available immediately, from the point of view of the Department and that of the local authorities, how quickly could we move to a 25% rate, accepting that there would be differences between local authorities, depending on their current performance?  <\/p> <p>  Different people have different ideas about the NCT-style system.  My preference would be to combine the local authority inspection with the NCT certificate in order that when the local authority carried out its inspection, it would issue the certificate.  Dr. Hayden is absolutely right - any new landlord entering the system should have  to have an NCT certificate before they let.  If 25% of the remainder of the rental stock was inspected in one year, all other landlords would be caught over a period of four years.  All new landlords would have to request it and would not be able to let without it and all existing landlords would obtain it over four years.  A landlord would then simply have to ensure he or she had it.  The certificate would be renewed every fifth year for a relatively modest administrative fee.  The scheme would be relatively revenue neutral for the local authorities, but it would not be prohibitive for the landlord or the tenant if it cost between &euro;50 and &euro;80 to have the inspection carried out on a five-yearly cycle.  I think a landlord could handle it.  If we were to do it in that way, we would get the benefit of the Threshold proposal, that is, putting an obligation on the landlord.  There would be a revenue source for the local authorities to cover part or most of the cost of inspections and by the end of a period of four to five years all landlords would have the NCT certificate.  Inspections would continue on a rotating cycle.  If it could be tied in with the accreditation system, as Ms Carroll says, we could have something really robust within a very short period.  It would not be self-certification; it would not be private sector-led and there would not be concerns about spiralling costs.  For me, that is the model that combines the benefits of what everybody here is recommending and I would like to see it progressed as quickly as possible.  <\/p> <p>  I support the risk-based model, but coming from a local authority area where we have very few old rental buildings, I note that we have a lot of new rental buildings that do not meet standards.  We need to factor this into the risk-based model also.  We have lots of developments in Newcastle and Rathcoole and some in Lucan and Clondalkin that were built during the Celtic tiger era and which already have significant standards issues.  They should be included. <\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the responses of the Department, the County and City Management Association and the Residential Tenancies Board to the point Threshold is making about overcrowding.  It is absolutely right about how we should progress.  Moreover, I refer to the penalties for serious breaches.  Under the current legislation, someone who is in breach will receive an improvement or a prohibition notice.  Again, in most cases of non-compliance that is fine, as an improvement notice will help to sort out most of the problems.  However, it seems bizarre that if someone is in significant breach, there is no immediate sanction.  I am talking about the small number of very extreme cases.  I would like to hear people's views on how we can strengthen that aspect.<\/p><p>The Minister is considering this issue not in terms of the next piece of RTB amending legislation but the one after that.  What level of prohibition would be appropriate to hit those instances of extreme non-compliance?<\/p><p> One issue that has not been mentioned but which we raised during the debate in the Oireachtas is the role of estate agents and letting platforms in advertising properties that do not meet minimum standards.  There must be a responsibility and a liability on the letting platforms and, in particular, estate agents because while staff of the letting platforms do not visit the properties they advertise, estate agents do.  For example, one prominent estate agent is advertising properties in my constituency that have received neither planning permission nor a building certificate.  It is a matter of public record.  In fairness to the local authority, it has made a complaint to the Property Registration Authority, but I believe stronger legislative sanction is required.  What are the delegates' views on how that could be achieved?<\/p><p> I wish to raise two final points.  It is unacceptable that people living in social housing do not have access to the same rights and protections as those in the private rental sector.  That makes no sense.  The only reason it does not happen - Mr. Michael Walsh will panic when I say this - is that the State does not want to foot the bill in having that responsibility in the short term.  The cost of giving social housing tenants access to the RTB, particularly on issues related to standards and maintenance, would be phenomenal.  Mr. Walsh is correct that there is a problem in meeting the cost in that regard.  I am not sure if increasing rents would be the best solution, although it would be one, but ring-fencing rent payments coming into local authorities and only allowing that money to be used for maintenance could help to an extent.  There is also the recognition that social housing is subsidised and that the State has a responsibility, as the landlord, to maintain these properties.  There is a question mark against the level of financial support given to local authorities to meet these requirements.  Take a look at the housing stock to examine windows and see if there is damp.  Local authority managers will know this.  I am not criticising local authorities, but the system has not been set up in a way that allows local authorities to use the rental income in the first instance.  Again, I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on that issue.<\/p><p> The last issue is damp.  While overcrowding is an issue, damp is a big issue.  It is an issue in older private rental stock, newer Celtic tiger private rental stock and social housing.  The difficulty is that tenants are being blamed for damp and mildew on the basis of \"lifestyle issues\", as they are called.  We need to examine the matter from a policy and legislative point of view to provide greater clarity on who is responsible.  We had an architect and chartered surveyor before the committee when we discussed this issue. They said a problem was developing in many European countries because the improved energy efficiency of new builds meant they were retaining more moisture.  In addition, some of the units are smaller and there are higher levels of occupancy in social housing and some sections of the private rental sector.  This combination is driving damp conditions.  It is not a lifestyle issue linked with the tenant but a structural problem.  Do we need a policy or legislative response?  I believe it will be a bigger problem into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#H00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I will start with the 2021 targets.

The incremental approach was adopted to allow them and the sector in general to adapt IT systems, look at efficiencies and a consistent approach in implementation and application across all local authorities.  There can be recruitment issues in having the necessary staff.  An extra &euro;10 million would not be enough because there are many other issues that have to be addressed.

To echo some of what Mr. Paul Dunne said, we believe there has to be something on overcrowding.  There is a definition in the Housing Act 1966 which the CCMA representatives can address.  We must also be aware of what is in the Residential Tenancies Act, under which a landlord can serve a notice of termination in respect of somebody who is overcrowded in his or her property.  The instance the Deputy mentioned in the \"RTE Investigates\" programme and some of the very serious incidents we have seen are driven in a totally different way from some of the other instances where people are struggling to afford rents and there might be three children in one room, which would not meet the standards under the Housing Act 1966.  We do not want to see something being introduced overnight whereby many tenants would be put at risk of suddenly becoming homeless because we were going to serve notice on them where the local authority had stated it was not in compliance with the regulation.  We must be very careful about how we do this.<\/p> <p>  On our perspective, it is about a definition of serious overcrowding.  The Residential Tenancies Act contains a definition of serious anti-social behaviour and one could probably mirror something like it in the serious overcrowding piece.<\/p><p>It is important, particularly because of the type of housing market we have at present, that we try to differentiate between some of the issues which are occurring.  A person might need six months or so to find somewhere else that is a more appropriate size or he or she might be working with a local authority to move into social housing.  He or she should be not placed in a vulnerable situation in the interim.  That is the only thing that we would say requires caution.<\/p><p> To be clear, much of the overcrowding that received media coverage in recent months may not relate to tenancy agreements.  It may, in fact, relate to licence agreements.  We must consider where they fit within the legislative and regulatory framework.  Often, we get cases on overcrowding and it is the landlord bringing the case.  It is sometimes down to subletting or to Airbnb.  In many cases we have seen, the landlord was not even aware of the overcrowding.  We need to examine how this occurs.  A landlord might have let to one tenant who went off and made a business and suddenly put ten people into the property.  How does that get dealt with in the law?  It is a complicated area and we need to be aware of it.<\/p><p> I also wish to comment on the issue of damp and mould.  We get many cases coming to us.  As I said earlier, over 600 cases came to us last year in terms of standards and maintenance.  Another 10% of our cases involved a breach of landlord obligations and many had to do with the standard of the property involved, repairs and so on.  Ms Fogarty might comment briefly on the type of cases that come to us and how we deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>We would get cases for breach of obligations.

Some of the cases for breach of obligations would be in standards and maintenance, for example, that the landlord may not have carried out repairs and replacements.

We have seen cases for damp and mould and failure to carry out repairs and replacements.  The average award given would be about &euro;1,000, with the maximum of about &euro;7,000 having been awarded to tenants in certain cases where there was a breach of obligations to carry out the repairs and replacements.

It is estimated that approximately 20% of rented dwellings have a building energy rating, BER, of F or G, which is pretty low.  More than 55% are likely to be considered to have poor energy efficiency, with BERs between D and G.  Research by the ESRI has found that households living in relatively energy inefficient properties spend substantially more - up to &euro;419 more per year - on energy than households with better BER ratings.  That is a very important factor to take into account when we are looking at issues such as damp, for example.<\/p> <p>  On overcrowding, we would be in complete agreement.  There is an absolute need and requirement to have a definition of overcrowding within the legislation.  There are a number of existing definitions, as Ms Carroll has pointed out.  There is the 1966 definition and there are also good examples of overcrowding legislation to be drawn from the international framework.  However, one way or the other, the fact of the matter is that there are serious examples of overcrowding that go well beyond the enforced overcrowding that we are seeing because of a lack of accommodation.  We are seeing situations in our services where shift workers are, for example, sharing beds at different times of the day and night.  This is not and should not be a race to the bottom.  We have to bear in mind that we have an obligation to ensure that we have robust legislation, particularly around the health and safety of tenants, which has to be our primary consideration.<\/p> <p>  I am very glad the issue of licensees was raised.  We have serious concerns.  We need legislation over and above the existing residential tenancies legislation to incorporate the protection of licensees.  It is one of the most significant issues coming into our services at the moment and licensees have little or no protection under Irish law.  We would like to see the Residential Tenancies Acts amended to include licensees for protection.<\/p> <p>  On the difference between social and private rented housing, for many years we have increasingly been seeing a fudge on where social housing ends and private rented housing starts.  Under the Rebuilding Ireland strategy, two thirds of the social housing requirement is to be provided through the private rented sector.  Under the 2009 Act, somebody who is receiving support in the private rented sector is deemed to be in receipt of a social housing support.  It is Threshold's position, and has been for a very long time, that social housing tenants and private rented tenants should be brought together under the same regime, particularly in respect of dispute resolution and enforcement of tenancy rights.  As matters stand - the European courts have spoken on this - local authorities are acting as judge and jury in the context of their own tenants.  There is no independent mechanism for tenants to air their disputes outside of the body that is, in effect, their landlord.  From the processes of natural justice, we have taken the position for a very long time that we want to see the residential tenancies legislation extended to incorporate all social housing tenants, whether they be of voluntary housing associations, approved housing bodies, traditional council housing or social housing tenants with their supports provided through HAP, RAS, rent supplement or any other format.  We think the distinction between private and social tenancies is really not relevant as we are going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Mr. Smyth addressed some of the issues so I will just speak to just a couple.  In the context of inspection and meeting standards, we are moving towards a similar regime in terms of social housing.  For example, a pilot inspection programme was done in County Clare recently.  We are taking lessons from that and are in dialogue with the Department to move forward to a specific inspection regime across the country.  That will lead to questions regarding the required resources or otherwise but we would certainly see ourselves in that space from next year.<\/p> <p>  As to the question of why not before 2021, it is partly because of the fact that some are lower than where they are at the moment.  In my case, I would see us being at 20% by next year.  I think a good number of local authorities will be in that space.  The better immediate achievement here would be for everybody to get to 20% by 2020 maybe, so that we are getting very close to it.  That is really significant incremental improvement.  Taken in context, Dublin city needs another 70 or 80 environmental officers to achieve that.  There is an issue with workload.  The courts system is failure here in some respects because at the moment we are putting a major emphasis on getting compliance with improvement notices.  I do take the point, and Mr. Smyth might reflect on this, that in the extreme cases we do need to have significant sanction.  The balance between compliance and enforcement is a continual tension in all enforcement regimes.<\/p> <p>  There are other things in terms of us moving forward.  We need to do it on a relatively planned basis.  I am chair of the housing committee and one of the great challenges we have is that the 31 local authorities do not all go off in different directions and that we keep this co-ordinated.  There is a role for regionalisation in terms of back office supports in particular, so that we develop the skill sets on the enforcement side of things in terms of going to court and taking the follow-up.  We believe there is space for us to do that.<\/p><p> We need to improve our liaison with the RTB.  There are simple things such as the unique identifier.  We need our reporting to be based on the geographic information system, GIS.  Unique identifiers such as Eircode are not available to us in that context.  I see a very significant improvement coming by next year in terms of our systems and the reporting that develops from those systems.  The targets will ramp up significantly.  There was a 50% improvement last year and there will be a 50% improvement this year.  Incrementally, it is very good in terms of where we want to get to.  We want it to be on a planned basis.  The ultimate outcome here is compliance.  The ultimate outcome has to be that the landlord wishes to achieve compliance before rather than after the fact.  It is happening after the fact at present.<\/p><p> Mr. Smyth has a number of points to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I will address the issues relating to overcrowding, damp and mould.  I did a very quick analysis of the intensified inspection programme we did between 2012 and 2016.  We did them in approximately 12,000 or 13,000 units and overcrowding was not an issue.  It is a relatively recent phenomenon, possibly a result of what is happening in the rental market.  This is a complex issue.  If legislation is changed, that will have an impact in the context of other legislation.  Dublin City Council is very conscious of that.  It is important to look at natural overcrowding as a result of increases in family size versus gross overcrowding of properties.  We have looked at that.  The other issue in recent times is in owner-occupied properties where owners have found it difficult to meet mortgage repayments and rent out a room.  It used to be for one person but now it is for two, three or four people.  That is another issue.  If the owner is living on the property, it does not come under the regulations.<\/p> <p>  We have looked at private rental accommodation in a general sense and we would welcome a change in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to include definitions of overcrowding which would consequently be brought into the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations under which a local authority can determine occupancy rates in gross and extreme cases of overcrowding.  It is not for minor overcrowding.<\/p> <p>  Instead of going through the District Court, we would like the local authorities to be given powers to take cases to the High Court or the Circuit Court in extreme cases where the property is not compliant with standards, is overcrowded or where there is any issue the local authorities deem to be serious or putting tenants' lives at risk.  We feel that would be of benefit.<\/p> <p>  On damp, mould and condensation, I absolutely agree it is a highly complex issue.  It is a highly complex matter to deal with in both new and old buildings.  Heating, ventilation, insulation and the use of a property all have a bearing on mould, damp and condensation.  It is complex.  While retrofitting may increase thermal efficiency, it may also increase the consequences of condensation in the property.

How often are audits carried out to ensure, particularly in light of the current crisis in housing, the situation is assessed in order to ensure that social housing is sufficiently occupied and that there is not misuse?<\/p> <p>  In Dublin, rent accounts for almost 49.6% of a single person's income.  Outside of Dublin, the figure for last year was 10.9%.  In some cases, most of a person's income is going on rent.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that.

The data on under-occupancy in social housing are readily available to us.  We have cause to know that level of information because of rent assessments so we have it readily available.  I do not have the data at my fingertips but there is a level of under-occupancy in social housing.  Primarily it is as a consequence of the partners of elderly people becoming deceased.  It is quite difficult in a social context.  We seek to voluntarily move people into smaller units.  There is resistance in many instances for obvious reasons.  People are attached to their homes, as they have known them over a sustained period of time.  Equally, people have no wish to move away from their neighbours.  It is a very sensitive area.  We are continually seeking to engage with people.  In most local authorities, there are no rights of renewal for a sibling or a child in a scenario in which the person is not the primary tenant.  That varies across local authorities.  There is an objective across all local authorities to achieve greater occupancy levels rather than the other way around.  We have to do so conscious of the social circumstances of our individual tenants and the responsibilities we have towards them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>When we talk about an NCT system, we mean an NCT-style system.

We want to know that the brakes work before somebody gets into the car.  Similarly, we want to know that the property is safe before somebody resides in it.  That is, in effect, where we got the NCT moniker.<\/p><p> With regard to under-occupancy, I will not answer for the social housing sector but it has certainly been a difficulty for a long time.  Many single people are living in the private rented sector because, historically, much social housing has been geared towards families and tends to be in the three-bedroom style.  It is important that, as we look at the change in demographic profiles, single people should not be confined to the private rented sector.  When a three-bedroom property comes back to a local authority, it should be reviewed to see if it can be subdivided into two single units, for example.  There is no logical reason to take back a three-bedroom property and put it back out as another three-bedroom property.  There is an issue with single people being trapped in the private rented sector.<\/p><p> I am glad that the Senator raised the issue of rent, which is of huge concern to Threshold.  It is important that affordability in the rental sector is addressed.  We have seen a commitment from Government to the introduction of affordable rental housing.  We have yet to see any detail as to what that will be.  There is no question or doubt that we increasingly see people come in who are in jobs and are seriously at risk of homelessness because they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads.  That has to be addressed.  We also want to see effective implementation of the rent pressure zone legislation.  We have made numerous proposals to the Government about this.  That has to work effectively if we are to have any possibility whatsoever, in a market where we will not see adequate supply for a period, of making sure that people are not forced into positions where they go without food and necessities to pay rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>We heard last week that the cost of heating is going up.

We have a housing crisis.  Rented properties are a massive issue.  We have a lack of supply.  We are trying to bring in a system to help people.  There are cases in my area where landlords will not take housing assistance payment, HAP.  They take cash.  Since we have a lack of supply, we force people, since they cannot find proper accommodation, into homes where the landlord will not take the HAP.  Mr. Michael Walsh said that it should be getting better with current rental policies.  I do not see it because there is no joined-up thinking between organisations, and we have a dilemma.<\/p> <p>  The figures here relate to funding to local authorities for inspections.  Since 2004, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, has been providing funding for local authorities through the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There is over &euro;34.5 million, with &euro;1.7 million provided in 2017.  There are 31 local authorities.  I ask for the facts, figures and breakdowns of who got what and what accountability there is for every local authority.  How many inspections and enforcement proceedings happened?  There were none.  I do not blame anyone here for this but the biggest issue is staffing.  Most local authorities are under much pressure with staffing.  I hate the summer because every time the summer comes, through no fault of the local authorities, if someone is on holiday, they are lucky to get someone who will do that work as well as their own.  They could be trying to do three jobs and they do a great job.  I am not blaming the local authority staff.  We have excellent staff.  It is a problem across all 31 local authorities.  I can speak for my own local authority in Carlow.  It is understaffed.  Can we have accountability in respect of that money?  I see that provision has been made for allocation of &euro;2.5 million in 2018 with further increases proposed up to 2021.  The Department issued a letter to all the local authorities on 5 February.  The letter set out annual targets and requests each local authority to prepare an implementation plan to achieve this, including staffing, resource and other needs.  Will the witnesses be accountable about this?  Will every local authority come back to them?  I understand that each local authority is different, gets different funding, has a different system and has its own book relating to tenants and private landlords.

We have all 31 chief executives - I would always call them county managers - there.  Can we not all work together on a plan?  I have only learned all of this since I have come to these meetings.  Dublin is able to say that its policies are different and Waterford's policies are different.  If policies are not similar, the only ones who lose out are the tenants and the people in private rented accommodation.  What was the outcome of the letter that was sent to all the local authorities?  What different issue faces every local authority?  Can we have a breakdown of the &euro;34.5 million and &euro;1.7 million provided to the local authorities in 2017?<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  It is an issue since people are taken off the housing lists and it is deemed that they have a house, yet repairs need to be done.  This goes back to every local authority.  Activity in respect of my local authority's repair system, whether for dampness or another issue, is very low.  Other local authorities do much more work than some.  That is not acceptable.  The witnesses should get together and have a scheme for all local authorities, whether to fix dampness, a cooker, a fireplace, windows or doors.  These are all issues for which local authorities state they do not have funding.  Some local authorities are doing it and others are not.  That is unfair because in the end, everybody pays the rent.  It is the same throughout the country.  The cap is &euro;150 to &euro;180.  The highest earner pays, whatever the number in the house.  The proper money is paid across the country, through the local authorities.  We need to look at that.  Could the witnesses get a system together and work on joined up thinking?<\/p> <p>  We spoke about the NCT.  It is probably a matter of wording.  There needs to be a proper NCT for private rentals.  I come across cases relating to private rental not working.  Rent pressure zones were introduced recently and I asked the Minister many times how can he expect a rent pressure zone to work when he will not bring it in to every local authority, that is, when neighbouring local authorities have it while others do not?  Every local authority should have this.  We have none in Carlow.  Wicklow, our neighbouring county, has it.  That does not make sense and it is unfair on the local authorities that do not qualify for it.  I do not understand, when we are in a housing crisis and are told that we need to do things urgently, why the Minister will not bring it in across the 31 local authorities.  He says we have to go back to look at phase 2.  Some local authorities did not qualify under phase 1, so he has to look at phase 2.  He cannot guarantee if the other local authorities will qualify.<\/p><p>That is unacceptable.  I am not blaming the witnesses but there must be a joined-up approach and every local authority must get its fair share of funding.  I acknowledge they cannot compete with the cities such as Dublin and Waterford but the smaller local authorities need to be looked after.  That is where we are failing.  I firmly believe that the biggest issue we have is the lack of supply.  The rent pressure zones are not working.  We need accountability in housing.  We have good landlords - there is no point in saying otherwise - and we cannot categorise every landlord as not being good, but we need a balance.  I have been to several houses on which landlords need to do work and they are just not doing it.  I get on to the council and the council says that is not its remit.  We need to look at enforcement and legislation.  The biggest issue is staffing.  It is a massive issue.  I could talk all day about housing and local authorities, but perhaps the witnesses could come back to me on the points I have raised.  Figures are important to me in order that I can justify where this money is after going, what it is spent on, where it was spent and what difference it made to people's lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#M00800","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I do not want to get into rental pressure zones because the matter is not on the agenda for today but I would appreciate it if the witnesses could answer the questions Senator Murnane O'Connor asked, specifically those concerning today's topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#N00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>The Senator mentioned landlords not accepting HAP tenants.

Obviously, each implementation plan we have is different but, generally speaking, team-wise, resources are the major issue.

We must admit that the current system is not fit for purpose and that something radical needs to happen in respect of the rental market.  When I talk about the rental market, I do not just mean the private market; I mean the public side of it as well.  One of the disadvantages of this is that the biggest landlord, namely, the State is itself, is outside the regime.  It needs to be brought into whatever the future regime will be.  The NCT system as a model has been mentioned and is thrown out there a lot.  When it was mentioned years ago in the context of the motor trade, it was said it probably was not workable and could not happen.  It is now becoming an acceptable part of life, and we now have just over 2 million vehicles registered in Ireland that must go through an NCT system.<\/p><p>We also introduced the building energy rating system, BER, which is now a standard part of life.  These things can be done.  I agree that it takes time and that resources must be put behind it.<\/p><p> An inspection system would have two different aspects, one of which would be the physical structure of the building and whether the layout, ventilation, fire alarms and so on complied with the regulations.  This would a physical inspection that could be carried out.  This should be done regularly and no new tenancies should be signed up without that inspection being done.  That should be the starting point and it should then be reviewed every so often.  Critically, an unannounced inspection regime should also be brought in.  We should target 20% to 25% of all properties with unannounced inspections to deal with overcrowding, equipment not being in place and issues around damp.  This would be an holistic approach, but with two different systems.  It can be done if the will is there to do it.  As a society it needs to be done.  Social and local authority housing has to be brought into the system but would a local authority inspect itself by being its own inspector?  Would we rely on the private sector to do this?  Would we rely on the Residential Tenancies Board?  In fairness, it would not be very hard for the local authorities to inspect themselves and maybe another approach needs to be taken in how we do it.  We must, however, achieve an NCT-style system where the physical structure of the building is inspected before anybody can occupy it, and then we need a target of 20% to 25% of unannounced inspections annually on rental properties, which would deal with day-to-day issues of overcrowding, damp and lack of equipment.  These are just a few issues I wanted to raise, and if anyone would like to come back in, they are more than welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#N02800","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I will make a general comment.

The difficulty with the data on the Department's website is that the most up-to-date data on the private rental figures is 2013-2014.  If there are more up-to-date data, perhaps the Department could forward them on.  I assume that the most up-to-date data are the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, annual performance and indicator reports.  If there are other sources that we do not know about, maybe the witnesses would let the committee know because it saves them having to give it to us.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the rent issue, as raised by Mr. Walsh, the most up-to-date figures from one of the NOAC reports tell us that rental income during 2014 across the local authorities was &euro;348 million.  The costs of maintenance, rent administration and the community function was almost &euro;297 million.  The Waterford local authority had rental income of &euro;11 million but the maintenance and administration was &euro;7.1 million.  Clearly there is money there.  I am not saying that the &euro;6 million spent in 2014 was sufficient, and perhaps the Waterford local authority would have wanted to spend more if it had had it.  Is it a problem that rents are being diverted to other areas of local government expenditure or is it that rents could not cover the level of maintenance that is required?  I ask this in order for us to understand the issue properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#O00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>It is a complex question to answer.  I will refer to the situation in my area.  In general terms and keeping it very simple, the housing function plus central management as the overhead of the organisation and the maintenance function is generally managed in the overall budget.  There are other areas such as community services where there is a significant imposition of costs, with much of it focused on local authority estates and otherwise where there is expenditure.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at resources overall.  The answer to the Deputy's question will, in some respects, come from the inspection system.  We must have a standardised inspection system.  I take the point about local authorities conducting inspections, but regardless of who does it, the inspection system must be standardised and uniform in the private rental and the public rental sector.  As an indictor, that cost comes in at around &euro;150 per inspection contracted out.  It is not an insignificant amount when applied to 130,000 or 135,000 houses.  It needs to be done nonetheless because ultimately it is all about information and data.  If that inspection regime were in place now, one could start assigning costs to remediation of the issues that have been identified.  Resources are not that bad in the space but we would need to be able to prove that, and one of the problems is that post Celtic tiger and post recession, we have been forced through a diminution of resources into reactive maintenance and so on.  The optimum scenario is to have a planned maintenance regime that people clearly understand that is targeted to achieve the minimum rental standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>All of that is very positive but my core question is, on the basis of the NOAC report, when maintenance, rent administration and the community functions are added together, the total cost for all the local authorities is still less than the total rent that is collected.

It is very simple.  In a few simple words, how do we progress NCT-style rental property inspections from here?  The Department has said that it is anxious and that it is keen to look at it, but we need stronger commitments than that.  These proceedings are televised and many people who are involved in social and affordable housing, the rental sector and tenancies tune in to these and they are very interested in engaging with these meetings, albeit externally.  How can we go from this room today and progress the issue?  We all know the problems.  Everyone is talking about the problems.  Nobody is saying that there is not an issue or a problem, but I am interested in hearing from the County and City Management Association, because its members are at the coalface of the problem, about the NCT-style inspections.

An NCT-style inspection certificate for a property could be valid for a period of years, as with the car NCT certificate.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised an interesting point that it could be done over a period of years through the local authority inspection programme if it could be guaranteed to reach all rented properties over a period of time.  We would not be remotely prescriptive on that.<\/p> <p>  Threshold has done some work, through a subcommittee of Dublin City Council and with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  A report was produced for the housing strategic policy committee in the council.  One of the proposals was that the current requirement for a BER certificate for all rented properties could be expanded very simply to include minimum standards and, as illustrated by the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" Nightmare to Let programme and issues such as overcrowding, it would include requirements for fire safety.<\/p><p>Rather than a BER certificate, there would be a combined certificate which covered all the areas with which the landlord was required to comply.  We believe that certificate should be valid for a specified period, unless something happened.  It would be similar to how if one has a car crash and the vehicle is wreck, a national car test, NCT, certificate does not remain valid to put it back on the road.  If something comes in the way, such as some sort of significant damage, the certificate would cease to be valid.<br\/><br\/><i>Prima facie<\/i>, if one has a certificate, it is valid for a period, it is displayed on the wall of the rented property and can be seen by a prospective tenant to the effect that the property complies with minimum standards.  It might be signed by a local authority, or there could be a list of qualified persons who could provide a certificate of compliance similar to when a property is surveyed for conveyancing purposes.  That would be attached to any tenancy registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  When the landlord puts in his or her registration details, ideally at the same time as lodging his or her deposit, although a deposit protection scheme might be an issue for another day, he or she would also lodge a copy of the certificate or the certificate number which goes with the registration.  That would provide evidence that the property had been sufficiently inspected and had the certificate of compliance.<br\/><br\/>People cannot be expected to do this overnight, but as the bedsit ban was rolled out over four years, we think four years would be a reasonable period to roll this out.  This could be cost neutral for a landlord.  There is no reason it should cost significantly more than a BER certificate.  It ought to be tax deductible similar to other costs and expenses.  There is no reason a reasonable landlord should regard it as an additional imposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530693000,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Does anyone wish to make any further comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018070400002#P00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530693000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I am not entirely sure what is intended here.

We argue with the Department about the cost of inspections which we say cost us &euro;150 to &euro;200.<\/p> <p>  The Vice Chairman referred to unannounced inspections.  They are nearly impossible.  One will be knocking on a door with no one there to open it.  Our difficulty is that it is desperately resource intensive in trying to get access and get around the place.  Neither is it only the inspections, as they lead to further work, whether it is issuing a certificate or otherwise.  If I recall correctly, there are more than 300,000 rental properties.

It is probably supportive of the idea of certification.  We must look holistically across what we are doing in the rental sector.  We are in the middle of looking at legislative change in rent pressure zones, sanctions and registrations, and we need to factor in everything in the sector.  One cannot deal with one aspect alone at any time.  We have 340,000 tenancies and 174,000 landlords.  Dr. Hayden spoke about bringing it in over several years.  For certainty in the market, there should be a clear idea of where we are going, what we are doing and when things will be brought in.  Speaking to the stakeholders with whom I work, they feel that considerable surprise is brought upon them, along with the number of properties contracted last year for the first time in several years, which worries me.  It might seem like a cost but sometimes it is what can come across as very anti-landlord rhetoric.  We have all said here that we are discussing a small minority.  We need to ensure that we are doing this in way that is supportive to the sector and in such a way that landlords can deliver and comply.<\/p> <p>  We must also acknowledge that there is a huge lack of knowledge.  Both I and Ms Fogarty spend a lot of time with stakeholders trying to give them information and education.  Most landlords do not know the standards.  They do not know that they had to bring in window restrictors or that they need to install carbon monoxide detectors.  We have to start with basics.<\/p> <p>  There is much focus on the property but behind every property is a landlord and a tenant which is why we are focusing on a landlord accreditation scheme.  The NCT-type scheme needs to come in under that.  We have looked at models in Wales, for instance, where there is an accreditation scheme which is all about the landlord.  If the landlord does not comply with the standards, he or she does not get a licence.  It is not about the property, but about the landlord.  Without that licence they cannot act as a landlord to the property.  They must give it to an agent or someone else who must be accredited.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, we must go away and map out how this will work along with the other things we are introducing.  We need to look at legislative change.  Dr. Hayden says that it would come in and the RTB could do something but we could not do anything without legislative change.  If an NCT-type scheme were introduced, we would also have to go back and consider the Act which regulates the RTB.

Threshold is just as concerned about the loss of small-scale landlords in the system as anyone else.  It is our tenants who are most at risk of small landlords leaving the private rented sector.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, and institutional investors do not want our tenants - low-income tenants on State supports like HAP.

As such, we thank the committee very much for giving us this opportunity.  I introduce my colleagues, Dr. Brian Doherty, chief executive officer, and Mr. Ultan Ryan, secretary.  As we provided the committee with an advance copy of our statement, I will not need to go through it word for word.<\/p> <p>  As the members know, the narrative behind the authority is that the Act was signed into law at the end of December 2015.  The authority was legally established on 1 October 2016 and the members of the authority were appointed by the Government following the statutory nomination process.  That is quite an unusual approach in the sense that there are nominating organisations which provide two names to the Minister who, in turn, seeks approval of the nominations from Government.  The nominations then go before the D&aacute;il and Seanad for separate resolutions before the members are appointed by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The authority commenced with no staff, no accommodation and no money.  We thank the Department of Justice and Equality for helping us at the start-up stage to identify and secure the very experienced Ms Renee Dempsey, who took on the role of interim chief executive for the authority as well as our experienced secretary, Mr. Ultan Ryan, who has stayed with us.  Ms Dempsey and Mr. Ryan did a terrific job in the early period with no staff.  They helped to secure our funding through the accounting labyrinths by the end of 2016.   The authority faced an initial challenge in that we were required under the law to present within six months of the authority's establishment day two reports to the Minister for subsequent laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We were required to engage in public consultations and to prepare reports on legal partnerships and multi-disciplinary partnerships.  Both of those requirements were met.  Our reports have been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available on our website.  Dr. Doherty came on board as permanent full time chief executive in September 2017 and he has shown remarkable and effective leadership.<\/p> <p>  There are six lay members of the authority who are nominated by the Citizens Information Board, the Higher Education Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants and the Consumers' Association of Ireland, respectively.  Of the non-lay members, one is nominated by the Bar Council of Ireland, one is a solicitor nominated by the Legal Aid Board, one member is nominated by the Honorable Society of King's Inns and two are nominated by the Law Society.  The authority has a lay majority and a lay chair and each member is statutorily required to act on a part-time basis.  The authority is required by law to be independent in the performance of its functions and to act in the public interest.  We all understand that we are nominees and not representatives of the nominating organisations.<\/p> <p>  The authority is tasked with regulating the provision of legal services by legal practitioners and ensuring the maintenance and improvement of standards in the provision of those services in the State.  We have six overarching objectives which are set out in law, including to protect and promote the public interest; to support the proper and effective administration of justice; to protect and promote the interests of consumers relating to the provision of legal services; to promote competition in the provision of legal services in the State; to encourage an independent, strong and effective legal profession and to promote and maintain adherence to the professional principles of legal practitioners as specified in the Act.<\/p><p> Within that overarching mandate there are a number of specific functions, which are listed in my opening statement, and I can go through them if the members wish me to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Don Thornhill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>By all means, please do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#D00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The authority is required to keep under review and make recommendations to the Minister in respect of the admission requirements of the Law Society relating to the solicitors&rsquo; profession and of the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns relating to the barristers&rsquo; profession; the availability and quality of the education and training, including ongoing training, for the solicitors&rsquo; and barristers&rsquo; professions, including the curriculum arrangements for the provision of legal education and the teaching of legal ethics, negotiating skills, alternative dispute resolution and advocacy, and the methods by which, and the persons by whom, such education and training is provided; the policies of the Law Society regarding the admission of persons as solicitors in the State, and of the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns regarding persons becoming entitled to practise as barristers in the State; professional codes; and the organisation of the provision of legal services in the State.  We are required to disseminate information in respect of the education and accreditation requirements and other matters to which I referred; to specify the nature and minimum levels of professional indemnity insurance; to establish a system of inspection of legal practitioners for the purposes prescribed in the Act; to receive and investigate complaints; to maintain the roll of practicing barristers; to promote public awareness and disseminate information to the public in respect of legal services, including the cost of such services; to keep the Minister informed of developments in respect of the provision of legal services by legal practitioners and to make recommendations to assist the Minister in co-ordinating and developing policy in that regard; to undertake, commission or assist in research projects and other activities in respect of the provision of legal services, which in the opinion of the authority may promote an improvement in standards for the provision of those services and public awareness of them, and make recommendations to the Minister arising from those objectives; and to perform any other functions conferred on it by the Act or by regulations made under it.<\/p> <p>  We are also required to conduct appropriate public consultation processes and to prepare and furnish reports to the Minister, including recommendations, regarding the education and training of legal practitioners - an area to which I will return - the unification of the solicitors&rsquo; and the barristers&rsquo; professions and the creation of a new profession of conveyancer. <\/p> <p>  By the end of March 2017, we had carried out the immediate public consultations required.  We had submitted a further report on legal partnerships at the end of July and two more statutory reports followed at the end of September, which again involved public consultation exercises.  The first was a report on the establishment, regulation, monitoring, operation of multidisciplinary practices in the State.  The second dealt with certain matters relating to barristers, including the restriction on barristers holding client money and the retention or removal of restrictions on a barrister receiving direct instructions in contentious matters. <\/p> <p>  We also have had to build the necessary governance and operational infrastructure of a modern State body.  We have terms of reference, a code of governance, a protected disclosures regime and we have produced annual reports for 2016 and 2017.  We are committed to a culture of openness and transparency and the minutes of each authority meeting are available online as soon as they are agreed.  We have developed and published a strategic plan for 2018-20 - which we have included in the documentation forwarded to the Chairman and members - which sets out the timeframes for some of the deadlines for meeting some of the functions envisaged by the Act.<\/p> <p>  We are still a fledging organisation.  We are in temporary accommodation.  We have a small number of staff but we have sufficient for our immediate needs.  We have a small project team to meet the statutory deadlines which are still outstanding and to put in place the infrastructure required.<\/p> <p>  Currently, we are involved in four key projects, as well as developing the personnel and organisation structures.  One project includes establishing the framework required to introduce legal partnerships as a new business model for the delivery of legal services.   We hope to have that necessary framework in place before the end of the third quarter of the year.  Our next significant task is to establish the roll of practising barristers.  This will list, for the first time, all qualified barristers who intend to provide legal services in the State, including those who work outside of the Bar library or are in-house barristers.  Work is under way on this and we hope to have the roll completed and available online at the end of the year.  We are carrying out a review of section 34 of the Act on the education and training arrangements for legal practitioners.  This has required an extensive public consultation, which has just been completed.  We will report to the Minister on that, with recommendations, by 30 September 2018.  Our other task is pertinent to the point mentioned in the letter from the committee.  We are carrying out a review under section 6 of the Act, requiring the authority to make recommendations for legislative amendment as it considers appropriate arising from its findings and conclusions.<\/p> <p>  We have prepared and submitted our first strategic plan.  We believe it sets out a realistic and achievable timetable for the introduction of the new regulatory regime and the delivery of the full range of functions of the authority.  Clearly, there is a quite an amount of work to be done.  By October 2019 we plan to have introduced the frameworks necessary for both the legal service delivery models of legal partnerships and, following that, limited liability partnerships.  We also plan to have delivered a series of significant statutory reports, including a review of the education and training of legal practitioners, a review of the admission of persons to the legal professions and a review of the Act.  In addition, we plan to have established the roll of practising barristers and we are working on the introduction of a levy on the legal profession.  We also, by October 2019, will have commenced the receipt and investigation of complaints and we will be in a position to conduct disciplinary hearings under Part 6 of the Act. <\/p> <p>  We believe the authority, acting within the framework of the Act, has the potential to act as an agent of significant change in the landscape for the provision of legal services.  Our approach will be in line with the principles set out in the Act, which I mentioned, and will be measured and consultative.  We are at an early stage in our development but we intend to continue to deliver on our statutory and governance obligations, while planning and delivering on the ambitious possibilities for future reform set out in the Act.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members and we look forward to engaging with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Don Thornhill"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Thornhill.

I have another meeting at 10 a.m. and must leave to attend it but I hope to be back.  I will ask a few questions before that time and I will certainly be back if I can make it.<\/p> <p>  We have to consider this discussion in the context of the fierce resistance put up by the legal profession to the introduction of this legislation and the fact that the previous Minister, Alan Shatter, basically allowed the legal profession to rewrite the original legislation against the backdrop that reducing legal costs in Ireland was the only troika demand that has not been implemented.  According to the National Competitiveness Council, legal service prices were 8.3% higher in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2012.  That is the backdrop, namely, a battle to avoid regulating the profession.  The authority has been established for a number of years but progress has been incredibly slow.  I am not blaming the witnesses or personalising the issue but I would like to tease out why that has taken so long.  The authority carried out the statutory public consultations and completed the reports that have been laid before the House but it has not yet found a permanent office.  It took a year to get a chief executive for the authority and it has only just published its strategic plan.  The process is moving incredibly slowly.  How many of the functions under the legislation are currently operational and how many are not?  Given that matters are moving very slowly, can Dr. Thornhill account for the delays?  Are organisations such as the Law Society standing in the authority's way, is there a cultural reluctance to move matters froward or is there some other way in which Dr. Thornhill can account for the slow progress?   <\/p> <p>  The authority's public complaints function is a major issue for the public.  Is it anticipated it will come into effect in the first half of 2019, which will be three years after the Act commenced?  Why will it have taken three years before the public can bring their complaints to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority?<\/p><p>Does Dr. Thornhill have any qualms about the fact that while this was an area of reform, we are two years on from the regulatory authority being established and that has not been forthcoming yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#D00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Perhaps we can take that first batch and then I will come back to Deputy Clare Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#E00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":494,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#E00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Clare Daly.  First of all, as a former chair of the National Competitiveness Council, I was involved in reports which commented, I think over a period of ten years, on the high cost of legal services in Ireland.  I am very much aware of the background.<\/p> <p>  On why it has taken so long, it has been a matter of frustration for us that it has taken so long.  The regulatory authority was established on 1 October 2016.  That was purely a legal act.  There was nothing there other than an almost complete membership of the regulatory authority - it was not quite complete.  We were not able to meet as a full regulatory authority until 26 October.  Then we had to find accommodation and begin the process of trying to develop an administrative and management resource because, as the Act says - deliberating and wisely -  members of the regulatory authority can only act in a part-time capacity.  I am a former civil servant - I left a number of years ago.  One of the things that struck me is how much more rigorous, demanding and time consuming the public administration requirements are today than they were 20 years ago.  Painstaking processes now have to be undergone in respect of procurement and appointments. All of those take time.<\/p> <p>  We moved as quickly as we could.  We had an interim chief executive - a very experienced individual - in place quickly.  We immediately began the contractual process of appointing a recruitment consultant from a process supervised by the Office of Government Procurement.  That was not there in my time as a civil servant.  The process ended in Dr. Doherty's appointment as chief executive.  Ideally, we should not have begun without staff.  We should not have had the statutory deadlines we had to meet for carrying out consultations but those are facts and requirements of the Act.  We were obliged to allocate such resources as we had in that area before we could get into the business of building up the structure of the organisation.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the disciplinary procedures, I take on board what Deputy Clare Daly stated.  It is taking some time.  One of the factors we want to be absolutely assured about when we open those important functions - because not only do they open up the possibility of redress for clients of legal services but they also have very serious implications for legal practitioners as well - is that we are resourced adequately in respect of personnel and facilities to handle that work and that the basis on which we are doing it is absolutely legally sound.  All of that requires very careful attention to detail and planning when it is being done quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Don Thornhill"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Are we sure this is going to come in the first half of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#E00500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>That is our resolve and intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Don Thornhill"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Thornhill optimistic that will be met?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#E00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530691200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Optimism might be a misplaced characteristic.

An external consultant was engaged and I refer to the rest of that as well.  It reflected a certain tension between the regulatory authority and the Department.  This ties in with my question, which Dr. Thornhill referred to in his opening statement, about the establishment of the framework to introduce legal partnerships.  Dr. Thornhill is saying that this will be in place by before the end of the third quarter of this year.  These partnerships were fiercely resisted by the Bar Council and the Honourable Society of King's Inns.

That was conveyed to the Minister in strong terms in the minutes that Deputy Clare Daly would have read.  Since then - and Dr. Doherty can go into this in more detail - we have had very satisfactory co-operation with the Department.

The Deputy is an able legislator.  One of the impressions she conveyed is that the legal profession managed to get this legislation changed for the benefit of itself.  I welcome the fact that, as the regulator, Dr. Thornhill, is a lay person.  I also welcome the fact that the majority of the people on the board are lay people.  It is appropriate that the regulatory body should not be dominated by members of the profession it is regulating.

At the first meeting of the authority, I reminded members that they were there to represent the public interest, not as representatives of their nominating bodies.  I am satisfied all members of the authority are conscious of their wider public interest obligations.  When it comes to seeking legal advice, we have had, and have, some distinguished lawyers as members of our authority but we do not seek legal advice from them.  We seek independent legal advice, particularly regarding our documents.  That is one precaution against what one might regard as subtle capture by a particular interest.<\/p> <p>  We also have other strong interests on the authority from the consumer and legal education spheres.  It is often the case that impartiality is helped when one has contending views and opinions.  I see it as a particular responsibility on myself to ensure that independence.  The episode to which Deputy Clare Daly referred was in itself significant.  I shared a sense of severe disappointment when I saw the initial communications from the Department.  Those were shared unanimously by members of the authority.  We had no hesitation as an authority in dealing openly with this issue, rather than doing it by way of conversations.  We felt it was important that we should put the discussion of the authority into the full minutes of the authority meeting and to convey them in writing to the Minister in order the public knew what was going on.

The education of people entering the legal profession is extremely important not only for the purpose of having well qualified lawyers who are important in any society but also because, as in every other country, one can only become a judge if one is a lawyer.  We have had a discussion for many years about the judiciary Bill.  One of the objectives of this committee is to try to increase and broaden diversity within the Judiciary.  Obviously, there is a responsibility on the legal profession and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to broaden that diversity by enabling more people to gain access to legal education in order that they can become lawyers and judges.  Is the issue of broadening access to legal education of concern to Dr. Thornhill?  I would have thought costs is a precluding factor for many people when they want to try to become lawyers.

We have completed consultation and are preparing a report, which we will publish in early September, in which the issue of access will be very much to the forefront of our minds, and I believe it is to the forefront of everybody's mind.  For example, most people in Ireland are aware of how difficult it is not so much to qualify as a barrister but to get traction and develop a living as a barrister.  That, in itself, is limiting in terms of the number of people who can pursue a career at the Bar.  Limited partnerships, legal partnerships and the other forms of partnerships will allow for the early employment of young barristers working in a legal environment.

Forgive me if my questions are a little different as I do not know enough about this matter but I am interested to learn about it.  To follow up on Deputy O'Callaghan's point on education and opportunity, he made the point that the efforts we have been making to bring more diversity and societal representation into the Judiciary have not been easy.  We are up against serious obstacles.  Regarding people studying law, it is fair to say that the vast majority of people becoming solicitors and barristers come from a well off background.  Many of them come from private schools.  It is an elitist profession.  For example, I know a girl who trained to be solicitor and when she had completed her training it was as if she had to serve her time in that she was paid very little for the first few years.  One could not do that without parental support.  Only those who come from well off families could possibly spend so long trying to get on the first rung of the ladder at which point they could get a decent wage.  The system seems to be structured to keep it elitist.

The role of the office will be a public one and one hopes it will, over time, establish norms that will be viewed as reference prices.  In other words, the consumer would be aware of what the going rate is for the provision of certain types of legal services.  If we take an example at the other extreme, a consumer going into a supermarket has a general idea of the price of particular commodities in the supermarket and whether it is an expensive store and he or she will make decisions accordingly.

This was done under section 34 of the Act and the report is broad and significant for the LSRA.  We have a research team currently involved in pulling together a wide range of data.  One of the issues to be encompassed within that report is access to legal education and professional training as solicitors and barristers for those from a less wealthy background.  The LSRA will address that issue and a range of other matters in its report to the Minister, which, by statute, must be submitted by 30 September this year.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Thornhill said, a number of aspects of the 2015 Act deal with legal costs.  One point I will add to what Dr. Thornhill already said is that the LSRA will be able to investigate any complaints of charging of excessive costs.  The LSRA will have a research function and will publish information on the costs of legal services.  Under the Act - I believe it is under section 150 - legal practitioners will be required to provide estimates of the cost of legal services in advance of providing those services.  There are a number of different aspects that will hopefully increase transparency around legal costs for the benefit of the consumer and may also serve to bring costs down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Doherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I return to the point that someone who qualifies must work for peanuts for a few years until he or she gets more experience.

The authority representatives want to be careful about what they say and the associated implications, but it has been a slow start in the context of a two-year window.  There are serious issues around cost, such as those gone through by Deputy Clare Daly.  There are issues around the complaints process as well as education and training.

The authority should learn from the experience of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, to which Deputy Wallace referred.  I recall two years ago everything was fine and there was little criticism from the people there.  They said there was proper engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality.  It was all politically correct around the engagement of the commission and how it was getting on.  Underneath it all, it was very difficult for GSOC.

The classic distinction is that a solicitor is involved in an array of functions on behalf of clients - probate, conveyancing, litigation, etc. - whereas a barrister is responsible for giving opinions and advocacy.  For a number of years solicitors in Ireland have raised the issue of the advocacy role.  Solicitors now have the right of audience, as it is referred to quaintly, in the upper courts and can act as advocates.  What will be the outcome of our deliberations on the issue?  Some argue vehemently that not only are there economies in the current dual track, but it also means that people can have access to the best barristers in the country.  There is obviously a cost issue for some people under what is called the \"cab rank\" rule, whereby barristers line up and take briefs from solicitors.  Clearly, any reform in this area would be very fundamental for the profession.  Perhaps the draftspersons were wise in drafting those provisions, particularly the four-year rule, to give us all an opportunity to see how legal partnerships and limited liability legal partnerships worked because, in effect, they provide for the possibility of solicitors and barristers working under the same roof and dealing as a unity with a client.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018070400002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Don Thornhill"},{"type":"speech","time":1530691200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>While it may be open to interpretation, it does not go as far as to suggest the structure of the unification of the respective professions.

I do not want to walk into the dark side - one refers to the other as the dark side; I suppose it depends on to whom one is talking - but there is a practice of holding clients' money and withholding payment to a barrister for services given.  A number of reasons were given for young barristers not being able to stay the course; it all comes down to affordability.  However, it could take years for payment to issue.  While it is not a word I like to use, there is a significant drop-out rate among young qualified barristers in moving over to a solicitor's practice, into corporate work or perhaps away altogether, with all of their years of study and preparation lost.
