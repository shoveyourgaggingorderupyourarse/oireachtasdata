This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms such as Defence Forces vehicle fleet. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and for two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.  No decisions have been made for the acquisition of additional aircraft in other roles.  Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  While the option of acquiring a wider military lift capability has been mentioned, it is not identified as an action for acquisition in the present 5 year Equipment Development Plan, which was developed through a joint civil-military approach.   Much of this longer range lift capability for military purposes is provided by way of chartering aircraft through a competitive procurement process on an as-required basis.  To date, this has been considered to be the most cost effective approach taking account of the acquisition, running and maintenance costs of larger aircraft in the context of their expected usage and contingency requirements.  The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to domestic duties, while the Defence Forces are not a primary response agency for non-security related emergencies, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in an Aid to Civil Authority (ATCA) role. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Defence Organisation, the Air Corps provides a broad range of services in accordance with its primary security role.  The Air Corps also undertakes a diverse range of non-security-related tasks on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis including the provision of air ambulance services to the Health Service Executive (HSE).    This support is underpinned by agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to other requests for support, the Air Corps and indeed the Defence Forces, can be made and are made available, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the unique situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional PC-12 NG aircraft was purchased to provide immediate additional fixed wing capacity. This aircraft provides the Air Corps with a further agile resource to service urgent requests from the HSE and other agencies of the State. Over the last year, the Air Corps have been involved in the transportation of COVID-19 tests to Germany in direct support of the effort to fight COVID-19, as well as fulfilling a broad range of other security and non-security roles as detailed above.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300064#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 5 and 6 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[24899\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300064#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"when he expects the numbers in the Defence Forces to reach the approved threshold of 9,500; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[24901\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300064#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of new recruits that have enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 17 together.<\/p>  <p>  The military authorities have advised that, as at 31st March 2021, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, was 8,524 personnel. The Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel as set out in the White Paper on Defence (2015).  There are a number of factors, many of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that there are on-going difficulties in the Defence Forces, and these have been well-documented in the Air Corps and Naval Service. A sea-going service commitment scheme and a tax credit, both for sea-going Naval Service personnel, are examples of targeted measures I have introduced. These are aimed at retaining experienced personnel. This follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps.<\/p>  <p>Recruitment is ongoing and has resulted in 149 personnel being inducted as at 30 April 2021 and further inductions are planned.  General Service recruitment continues and the Cadet competition was launched recently.

For these Naval Service specialties, sanction has been received to provide for direct entry at a higher point on the salary scale where previous earnings indicate earnings in excess of the first point on the scale.   <\/p>  <p>  A key measure to address recruitment and retention challenges is the implementation of the report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  This report contained a range of pay and non-pay measures. Some recommendations were applied immediately while others were progressed through a series of projects, most of which are implemented and the others are nearing finalisation.  The Defence Forces have also benefited from pay increases under successive Public Sector Pay Agreements. Other measures are being considered in the context of the new public sector pay agreement. <\/p>  <p>  A Commission on the Defence Forces has also been tasked with examining a range of issues and this work is underway. On completion of the work of the Commission, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body for the PDF, reflecting the unique nature of military service in the context of the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the capacity of the Defence Forces will take time. However, I can assure the Deputy that the challenges are being addressed and work in this regard is a priority for civil and military management and myself. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300064#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300064#WRA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[24907\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300064#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the role of the Naval Service in fisheries protection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency tasked with a variety of defence and other roles.

The terms and rules of the Single Scheme &ndash; which are fundamentally different to previous superannuation public service arrangements &ndash; make no provision for the concept or award of &lsquo;supplementary pensions&rsquo; for any new entrants joining any public service group from 1 January 2013 onwards.  <\/p>  <p>  I have not had discussions with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the question of using the provisions of section 15 of the 2012 Act to address the matter of &lsquo;supplementary pensions&rsquo;.  Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the Single Scheme pension terms and conditions comes under the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the appropriateness or otherwise of the application of that particular provision would of course be a matter for that Minister and his Department.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the situation regarding &lsquo;supplementary pensions&rsquo; has previously been confirmed by the Official Side, which includes the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the Defence Forces Representative Associations.  They were advised by DPER officials in October 2017 that &ndash; given the overriding policy and fiscal objectives of the Single Scheme &ndash; there were no plans to provide for the supplementary pension concept in that Scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  Since then, the issue has of course featured very prominently in discussions under the established machinery between the Official Side and the Representative Side.  This includes discussions at the Defence Forces Conciliation Council, at the negotiations on the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-20, in RACO&rsquo;s submissions to the Public Service Pay Commission, and again in RACO&rsquo;s recent submission to the Commission on the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, met with RACO in September 2019 and the matter was discussed.

Due to unforeseen circumstances including Covid-19, the meeting did not take place until 30th   September 2020.

The UN direction impacted over 100,000 UN uniformed personnel from over 120 countries serving world-wide, including Ireland and Defence Forces personnel serving with UN missions.

In that regard, it is similar to other EU industry and research support programmes, such as Horizon 2020 also funded from the MFF.   <\/p>  <p>  The EDF provides a financial mechanism designed to enable and accelerate cooperation among Member States to better coordinate, supplement and amplify national investments in defence. Through the co-funded European Defence Fund, Member States will be able to achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not be feasible on their own, by pooling national resources.  The Fund will also foster innovation and allow economies of scale, which will enhance the competitiveness of the EU defence industry.  <\/p>  <p>The Regulation establishing the European Defence Fund  was adopted on the 29 April 2021. In relation to transparency on funding allocation this is fully explained in Chapter III of the Regulation \"Eligibility Conditions, Award Criteria and Financing\".  Participation in the EDF does not broker any consideration or obligation in respect of a common or mutual defence commitment or participation in a military defence alliance.  As such, participation in the EDF will not compromise Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. <\/p>  <p>  The Fund will be divided into two windows, which are complementary - the Research Window and the Capability Window. As part of the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 a final budget which translates into a current value of just under &euro;8 billion was agreed in July 2020. It will be split between a research budget of &euro;2.651 billion, and a capability budget of &euro;5,302 billion.  EU Budget revenue is general, and is not assigned to any particular fund. As such, the European Defence Fund (EDF) does not have a defined cost to the Exchequer; rather, Ireland&rsquo;s contributions go into the general pool of revenue that funds all EU budget expenditure, including the EDF.  The EDF is encompassed within the funding being provided for the MFF which is funded directly by the Exchequer.  As such, no charge arises for my Department's Vote as a result of the establishment of the EDF.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department attends the EDF Expert Group Meetings, which will shortly progress to the Programme Committee Group meetings now that the Regulation has been adopted.  We have also worked with a number of like-minded EU Member States to ensure that optimal conditions exist within the instrument for national SMEs to avail of funding.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has no role in administering the EDF; that is the function of the EU Commission's Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space (DEFIS).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300066#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":127,"content":"<p>Question No. 57 answered with Question No. 23.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":128,"content":"<p>Question No. 58 answered with Question No. 56.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300066#WRC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[1471\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300066#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the future plans for Custume Barracks in Athlone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces Built Infrastructure Plan provides a blueprint for investment in the Defence Forces built infrastructure over a rolling five year timeframe and is designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities of the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  The commitment to the ongoing operation of Custume Barracks, Athlone, has been reaffirmed with the recent completion of the new Dining Hall complex.

The meeting was held back-to-back with a Foreign Affairs Council (Defence) meeting.  The only agenda item for the EDA meeting was a discussion on the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD).  <\/p>  <p>  The meeting was chaired by Head of Agency\/High Representative, Josep Borrell.  In addition to Ministers for Defence, other attendees included Mr Jir&iacute; &Scaron;ediv&yacute;, EDA Chief Executive, General Claudio Graziano, Chair of European Union Military Staff, and EU Commissioner Thierry Breton.  The purpose of the meeting was to inform on the first steps taken and on the way ahead regarding the implementation of the 2020 CARD recommendations in the areas of defence spending, defence planning and defence cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  CARD is a process within the EU where Member States exchange data on future plans in relation to defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment.  The process aims to create greater transparency through sharing information on defence plans and thus facilitating opportunities for greater collaboration among member States on defence capability development, investment and procurement.  The objective of CARD is to review the participating member States defence activities in order to provide, over time, a comprehensive picture of the European defence landscape, which includes capability development, Research &amp;Technology efforts, the defence industrial dimension, and operational aspects. Potential benefits include more focused spending, cost sharing and greater interoperability.<\/p>  <p>  The first full CARD Cycle was completed  in 2020 and the CARD report was presented to Defence Ministers in November 2020.  The Report makes recommendations across defence planning, defence spending, defence cooperation, and on the fulfilment of the EU CSDP level of ambition and operational dimension.  <\/p>  <p>  The focus of the EDA meeting on the 6th May was on defence cooperation.  The CARD Report identifies a total of 55 collaborative opportunities throughout the whole capability spectrum, considered to be the most promising, most needed or most pressing ones, also in terms of operational value. The report recommends Member States should concentrate their collaborative capability development efforts on &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; capabilities in six focus areas &ndash; Main Battle Tank; European Patrol Class Surface Ship; Soldier Systems; Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS); Defence in Space; and Enhanced Military Mobility.  While not all focus areas are of interest or applicable to Ireland, those which are of interest are (1) European Patrol Class Surface Ship; (2) Soldier Systems and (3) Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) . <\/p>  <p>  During the Steering Board meeting Members States voiced their support for CARD and welcomed the work done to date. Member States also stressed a need to be realistic and clear in relation to how quickly Member States can implement the CARD recommendations into their military planning, a position which I would also support. Each Member State will need time to embed the CARD initiative within its own defence planning structures and procedures.  <\/p>  <p>  As the purpose of the meeting was to inform and discuss there were no decisions made or adopted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300066#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Infrastructure","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300066#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[25147\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300066#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the way in which he intends to protect Ireland&rsquo;s undersea fibre cables from the threat of interference or sabotage.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>I am advised that the operators of subsea telecommunications cables are subject to the provisions of the Authorisation Regulations (SI 335 of 2011) and must notify the Communications Regulator (ComReg) of their intention of providing such a service.

In particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and interconnected networks.  Networks in this context can include subsea cables.  This legislation is to be updated in the context of both the transposition of the European Electronic Communications Code, as well as the proposed revised Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS 2 Directive).  Recital 51 of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposed NIS 2 Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the EU states that submarine communications cables are to have appropriate cybersecurity measures in place. In that respect, the obligation on undertakings will continue under the new legislative framework. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the development of the 2015 White Paper on Defence, the Department engaged in a broad-ranging consultation process, including with all other Departments. At that time the Department of the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources outlined that resilience is built into the system to mitigate against any damage to submarine cables. High capacity and multiple routes provide resilience in the event of route failure.  Business Continuity Planning is of interest to all major international corporations. Where damage has occurred to a cable in the past, the operators have shared a cable while repairs are made.  Under the National Cyber Security Strategy, an updated detailed risk assessment of the vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyberattack is being performed.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are aware of active subsea fibre optic cables landing on the island of Ireland.

With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. Information on school enrolments and Child Benefit data allows the Department to map where children are living or attending school and this information provides a degree of certainty in projecting demand in an area in future years.<\/p>  <p>  Three initiatives have been introduced recently to strengthen the demographic analysis process.<\/p>  <p>   The first involves enhancing our engagement with local authorities in relation to the      information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process.<\/p>  <p>  The second involves the Department having additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements. Education and Training Boards, Diocesan Offices, and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, an Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can be an important source of local knowledge.<\/p>  <p>  The third involves the Department putting a structure and system in place for a national      inventory of school capacity to be completed by individual schools. When schools are providing their annual 30 September enrolment returns to the Department in respect of the Primary On-line Database (POD) for primary schools and Post-Primary On-line Database (PPOD) for post-primary  schools, they are now also requested to provide information in respect of overall demand for school places and available capacity within their schools. The compilation and analysis of this information at local, regional and national level through the Department's Geographic Information System (GIS) is an important additional feature of the school planning process. 2019\/20 was the first year of this initiative and the approach taken will provide a cost effective and efficient method for the provision and analysis of up to date data in relation to demand and capacity across over      3,500 primary schools and over 750 post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  While it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the last decade or more it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation to meet the accommodation needs of schools. <\/p>  <p>  Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate permanent or temporary accommodation solution.  However, even where an accommodation requirement is for the long-term it may not be possible to achieve this in all cases which then triggers a requirement for an interim accommodation solution.  For example, two key factors that impact on the timeline for providing a permanent building for a new school are the identification and acquisition of a suitable site and obtaining planning permission.  While good progress has been made on providing better lead in periods for the establishment of new schools and opportunities for use of existing State or other school sites are maximised wherever possible it nevertheless remains a significant challenge to be managed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300070#WRG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300071#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[25088\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300071#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a school building for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1453","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>A building project for the new Gaelscoil referred to by the Deputy is included in my Department's current Building Programme.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department have been working closely with Cork City Council towards acquiring a permanent site for this school.<\/p><p>A potential site option has been identified and discussions are still ongoing with the landowner with a view to acquiring this site.

This will afford school management greater flexibility to respond to the individual needs and priorities of their school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300072#WRHH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Process","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300072#WRHH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[24878\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300072#WRHH02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department will undertake a feasibility study into secondary schools registering 16 and 17 year olds to vote in preparation for the franchise being extended to those aged 16 years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the relevant Department responsible for the legislation dealing with the registration of electors and the conduct of elections and referendums.

Pupils need no longer experience delays in receiving reports which could, in the past, deny a child access to necessary learning supports.  <\/p>  <p>  Schools may allocate additional teaching support to pupils where it has identified learning needs using school based assessment or the Continuum of Support and the Guidelines provided to schools.

However, the Government has urged landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. With this in mind, on 1st October 2020, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. The aim of the voluntary Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.<\/p>  <p>  However, this Code should not be seen in isolation. To date, a range of supports have been developed for businesses, including the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), wage subsidies, a commercial rates holiday, low-cost loans, and a VAT reduction.<\/p>  <p>  As public health restrictions are eased and the economy reopens, the Government is committed to ensuring that there is no cliff edge in financial supports for businesses. As such, any business currently availing of CRSS and that can now reopen will be able to avail of double restart week payments for two weeks subject to the statutory maximum of &euro;5,000 per week to support them in meeting the costs of reopening as they exit the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest that small business owners contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business. Details of the Code of Conduct and the wide range of supports available for business are on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this week, Minister Troy announced the General Scheme for a Small Business Administrative Rescue Process providing for a simplified restructuring process for viable small companies that is both timely and cost effective.<\/p>  <p>  My officials continue to monitor international developments in relation to commercial rents such as the Swedish scheme mentioned. In this scheme, firstly landlords have to agree to a rent reduction; it is not a mandatory scheme. The Government support is then provided to the landlord. It is also worth noting that in the Swedish scheme it appears that if the landlord has already previously agreed to concessions (and the tenancy agreement has been amended) this scheme is not applicable. State aid rules also apply.<\/p>  <p>  The question of whether Ireland should provide grants to mitigate rental costs for commercial tenants was examined last year and it was found that there may be significant risk to the Exchequer if the State undertook to provide grants to defray commercial rents as the level of financial exposure is unquantifiable compounded by lack of accurate data on rent levels. As with the Swedish model, it was also determined that any financial assistance to business (tenants) tied to rents would likely end up as support to the landlord. The offering of assistance, or even the perception that such relief would be forthcoming, could affect the market and reduce the impetus for landlords to negotiate with tenants.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can help businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300075#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Supply Board","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300075#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[25274\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300075#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he has engaged with representatives from an organisation (details supplied) regarding is dispute with the ESB; and if he will encourage all parties to engage in dialogue to resolve the situation.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>Ireland's system of Industrial Relations is based in voluntarism.

Similarly, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme is also been extended to end June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Motions seeking D&aacute;il approval of the extension of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 30 June 2021 took place on Thursday 22 April, during which I reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment that there would be no cliff-edge to the economic supports at the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support for businesses could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable enterprises and employment and to provide firms with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that within the resources available appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.<\/p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300078#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[25315\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300078#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if businesses that are eligible for the Covid restrictions support scheme that were delayed in submitting their claim can receive the payment backdated to the closure of their business; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The current system already provides for a &euro;5,000 relief on VRT for electric cars valued at an open market selling price of &euro;40,000 and below, with a tapered relief up to &euro;50,000. In addition, low-emitting electric vehicles will benefit from a low VRT rate of 7%.

It is important at the outset to state that the provision of cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies. This is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive). However, I would like to assure the Deputy that insurance reform is a key priority for the Government, and Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to play a lead role in this policy area.<\/p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is primarily focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. Almost &euro;1 billion in flood relief measures is being invested over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027, with an expectation that insurers will provide cover where this has occurred. This approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Office of Public Works (OPW) and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should, in turn, provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas. <\/p>  <p>  While there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, it is recognised that some householders are still experiencing difficulties. This is particularly the case for households in areas with demountable flood defences. I am conscious of the challenges that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses.  My officials are engaging with both Insurance Ireland, the OPW and other stakeholders regarding flood defence schemes and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to flood risk management in East Wall, Dublin 3, I have been advised by the OPW that the area is afforded flood protection from two flood defence schemes progressed by both it and Dublin City Council.<\/p>  <p>  Part of East Wall is protected by the Tolka Flood Relief Scheme. The Dublin City element of this was completed in 2008 at a cost of approximately &euro;7.5m, and protects approximately 1,345 properties. The area in question also experienced significant tidal flooding in November 2002 when the Royal Canal overtopped. This is now protected by the upgrade of Spencer Dock Sea Lock.  Dublin City Council completed the Spencer Dock Scheme in 2009 with OPW funding of &euro;3.4m protecting approximately 1,200 properties. As a result of this investment, I understand the high tide event of January 2014, which was higher than 2002, did not result in any flooding in the East Wall area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300078#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[25256\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300078#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the Enniscorthy flood defence scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>The Enniscorthy (River Slaney) flood defence scheme is being progressed by Wexford County Council (WCC) on behalf of the Commissioners of Public Works as a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995.

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  <\/p><p>The HAP scheme is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling, if the dwelling was not already inspected within the previous 12 months. Local authorities carry out HAP inspections as part of their overall private rented inspections programme.<\/p><p>The HAP legislation provides a very structured, time bound system where serious lack of compliance exists and can result in termination of HAP payment.<\/p><p>Failure to comply with the minimum standards can result in penalties and prosecution. Local authorities can issue Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices to landlords who breach the minimum standards regulations. An Improvement Notice sets out the works that the landlord must carry out to remedy a breach of the regulations.<\/p><p>In the case of a Prohibition Notice being enforced, a local authority may provide, or continue to provide, HAP in respect of that property for a period of 13 weeks, to enable the household to find an alternative dwelling.<\/p><p>Local authorities report to my Department on numbers of overall inspections carried out and enforcement actions undertaken on a quarterly basis. The most recent data received in respect of the number of inspections of all private rental properties and those with HAP tenancies is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>HAP Inspections       carried out in 2019<\/th>       <th>Total Inspections     carried out in 2019<\/th>       <th>HAP On-site Inspections    carried out in 2020<\/th>       <th>Total On-site Inspections    carried out in 2020<\/th>       <th>HAP    Virtual Inspections    carried out in 2020<\/th>       <th>Total Virtual     Inspections carried out in 2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>23,424<\/td>       <td>40,728<\/td>       <td>12,031<\/td>       <td>24,315<\/td>       <td>991<\/td>       <td>1,388 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings &ndash; not just those with HAP tenancies.

This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors.<\/p><p>In response to the difficulties caused by pandemic restrictions, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council have led this initiative which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic\/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to so. <\/p><p>While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic.

There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.<\/p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.<\/p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Site Levy and the Vacant Site Levy increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. These levies are applied annually for as long as relevant sites remain derelict or vacant. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.<\/p>  <p>  There is a number of other measures which have been introduced over recent years to assist in addressing dereliction and vacancy. The Repair and Leasing Scheme was introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes. The scheme is particularly targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs is met upfront with a capital loan from the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB) up to a maximum of &euro;60,000. This allows the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement with a local authority or an AHB for a period of time that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum lease period of 5 years. Up to end 2020, a total of 234 homes had been brought back into use under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A similar measure entitled the Buy and Renew Scheme supports local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the suitability of a property for social housing. Important considerations in this regard include the location of a property in relation to housing need and demand; the design, scale and suitability of a property for social housing use; and the costs and practicality of acquiring and remediating a property.<\/p>  <p>  The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  As a complementary initiative to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, it provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners of the properties concerned. To date, local authorities delivered approximately 670 new social homes under the scheme.  Activity in this regard is largely delegated to local authorities so they can respond flexibly to all opportunities to provide new social housing.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of social housing, my Department can provide full funding to local authorities for sites on which they bring forward suitable new social housing construction projects, including sites acquired by compulsory purchase order under the Derelict Sites Act. I am keen to see our local authorities expand their ownership of suitable sites for new social housing and with the record funding levels we have secured for new social housing delivery in 2021, we are in a position to support new projects including the associated site costs. It would be important for local authorities to engage with my Department directly and through the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office in this connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300079#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300079#WRN04200"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[25250\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300079#WRN04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to transform commercial property on main streets into housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":664,"content":"<p>The Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2018, which came into operation on 8 February 2018, provide for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of the change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use. <\/p><p>This measure is aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply.<\/p><p>The Regulations operate for a limited period until 31 December 2021, which has now been extended to 25 February 2022 arising from the Covid-related shutdown of the planning system for 8 weeks during the period March to May 2020, which extended all planning timelines by 8 weeks. <\/p><p>The planning exemptions provided for in the Planning Regulations are kept under regular review. <\/p><p>Action 60 of the recently launched <i>Our Rural Future &ndash; Rural Development Policy 2021 to 2025 <\/i>commits to reviewing and extending the regulations which exempt certain vacant commercial premises, such as &ldquo;over the shop&rdquo; type spaces, from requiring planning permission for change of use for residential purposes in accordance with housing activation and Town Centre First policies.<\/p><p>The regulations will be reviewed before their expiry and I will bring forward any legislative amendments considered appropriate.

Significant progress has already been made through the Enniskerry Road pilot project supported by Serviced Sites Funding, the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, and through legislative provisions in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which was recently approved by Government and is now published. Our approach to Cost Rental has been modelled on similar successful models elsewhere in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  Cost Rental homes will be governed in line with provisions in the forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill, which defines Cost Rental in Ireland for the first time and will regulate tenancies in which rents only cover clearly defined costs. The Bill sets out how 'financing costs' are an element of the overall cost of delivery to be covered by rents, and that this category includes both interest on debt funding and also a limited return on any equity investment. While the precise figure for this limit on equity return will be set in Regulations, it is intended that it will be informed by the moderate return permitted for Limited Profit Housing Associations in other jurisdictions where the model operates very successfully.  <\/p>  <p>  Delivery of Cost Rental is expected to be through public and charitable bodies initially - Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA), and AHBs. It is also expected that State resources will support this initial delivery. In particular, AHBs will utilise the CREL scheme administered by my Department and the Housing Agency, together with loans on more commercial terms from the Housing Finance Agency. Allowance for a limited return on equity will permit AHBs and the LDA to invest their own funds in a sustainable manner, receiving a small return through rents and growing their resources. <\/p>  <p>  While past experience has shown the difficulties in designing a Government policy intervention to be delivered 'off-balance sheet', the legislation has been drafted so as not to prohibit private sector involvement in future years. Some element of private investment may help to deliver Cost Rental at large scale in high-cost locations, in the context of limited Exchequer resources and the difficulties of securing reasonably-priced finance when projects are largely or wholly debt-funded. Although equity returns will regulated and limited, there may be interest from non-State investors able to take a long-term view or with a particular emphasis on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors. <\/p>  <p>  If a private body is willing to commit to making homes available within the Cost Rental framework for a period of at least 30-40 years, such additional provision at no cost to the State would be positive. Private sector providers would be limited to the same allowable costs as Local Authorities, the LDA, and AHBs, with the same limited return on any equity investment. A private body would also be subject to the same Regulations, which will include the application process for landlords, eligibility criteria for tenants, mandatory elements of tenancy agreements, and an auditing process under which landlords must retain records and supply them to the Minister on request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300080#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":678,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300080#WRO01400"},{"type":"question","counter":679,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[25313\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300080#WRO01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will request local authorities to be conscious of the needs of the disabled and visually impaired when facilitating the erection of tables and chairs associated with on-street outdoor dining; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":680,"content":"<p>With a view to supplementing the Outdoor Dining Enhancement Grant Scheme which was recently announced by my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and further to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over the coming months, a package of amending planning regulations were made on 30 April last to assist in facilitating outdoor dining as well as increased vibrancy and commercial activity in urban areas, particularly in relation to the hospitality and restaurant sectors.<\/p><p>The package of regulations includes the waiving of the street furniture licence fees in respect of tables and chairs used for serving food outside hotels, restaurants, pubs and other establishments in the current year; enabling restaurants to operate as takeaways for the remainder of 2021 without having to apply for change of use planning permission; and revised planning arrangements in relation to the erection of awnings, canopies and other structures at such establishments to support outdoor dining with no fee being applied for the erection of such structures when ancillary to a street furniture licence for tables and chairs. <\/p><p>The licensing of street furniture and other appliances on public roads and footpaths is governed by section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), and by Article 201 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations).

We are working with our partners to assess the impact of these cuts and to ensure the continuation of their essential work.  The upcoming (June 2021) meeting of UNFPA&rsquo;s Executive Board, of which Ireland is currently an observer, provides an opportunity for further discussions.<\/p><p>Our funding to UN agencies is reviewed periodically, in the light of allocations to the official development assistance budget, and in view of agencies&rsquo; performance and the wider range of international development priorities to which Ireland seeks to respond. A &euro;3.5 million core contribution to UNFPA has been made in 2021, in line with contributions in 2020 and 2019 and compared to &euro;2.8 million in 2018.<\/p><p>In addition to the annual core contribution, Ireland also provides funding to UNFPA through bilateral programmes managed by our Embassies, which varies from year to year. In 2020, this additional funding to UNFPA amounted to &euro;1.8 million. Ireland does not provide direct funding to the UNFPA Supplies Programme.<\/p><p>Ireland also contributes to UNFPA through the EU. Collectively the EU and its Member States are the single largest financial contributor to the UN system, providing 25% of contributions to UN agencies.

In July of 2020 a tender competition was commenced for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces and the competition is currently underway. The scope of the project consists of two main requirements; Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements, the procurement process is on-going and is comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023.<\/p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet.  In 2019, a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3\/4 tonne 4X4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020.  In March of last year, a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4X4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon.  The first vehicles arrived in Mar-Apr of 2021 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023.  Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.

If the Minister decides to reduce the disability pension under Section 13(2), the reduction applies for the lifetime of the pension.<\/p><p>In April 1986 the person in question was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of an injury sustained while serving in the PDF. The person in question also instituted civil proceedings in respect of the same injury and was awarded compensation by the High Court.  The disability pension payable was therefore reviewed under the provisions of section 13(2) of the 1923 Act and it was decided to reduce it by the annuity value of the total compensation which the person in question had received. The annuity value in question was not a calculation based on recovery of the amount of compensation involved.  Instead, the purpose is to use an actuarial assessment to reduce the pension in a fair way to avoid payment &ldquo;on the double&rdquo; where compensation has already been received.<\/p><p>Subsequently, the person in question applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision to reduce the disability pension. The High Court quashed the decision to reduce the disability pension and ordered that the matter be considered anew. A fresh review of the disability pension was accordingly undertaken.  All aspects of the case (including, in particular, representations made by his solicitors) were fully considered and in March 1988 the then Minister decided to reduce the disability pension payable by the annuity value of the total  compensation received by the person in question. <\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the Courts, in various previous judgements, have upheld the Minister&rsquo;s statutory right to take into consideration that part of the damages which can properly be regarded as general damages or that part which can properly be regarded as referable to loss of earnings, or both these parts, as he considers proper.  Alternatively, the Minister may decide to take none of the compensation into account.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the disability pension in this case was properly determined in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions by the then Minister and I do not believe that a further review of the decision under Section 13(2) would be appropriate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300083#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":805,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300083#WRR01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":804,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300083#WRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[24601\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300083#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the promised new revised school transport system will be ready for September 2021 in order to eliminate the confusion of September 2020 (details supplied).","asker":"1499","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

DES Circulars 007 and 008 of 2019 set out how the allocations for schools were updated from September 2019.<\/p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.<\/p><p>Under the allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>The total number of SETs has increased by 39% since 2011, from 9,740 at that time, to over 13,600 at present. <\/p><p>Budget 2021 provided for an additional 990 additional Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) posts for allocation to schools, bringing the total numbers to 18,000 by the end of December 2021.  This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes and the transition to the new allocation model for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>The Budget 2021 increase to 18,000 SNAs posts represents an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.<\/p><p>The NCSE has published statistical information regarding SNA allocations for all schools which can be accessed on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie <\/i>or by using the following link <i><\/i>.  <\/p><p>I am satisfied that the very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years, and for 2021, to provide Special Education Teachers and Special Needs Assistants, means that all schools can be sufficiently resourced to provide for the special educational needs and care needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Schemes","counter":909,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT03200"},{"type":"question","counter":910,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[25460\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of applications for summer works schemes in respect of schools from County Kildare received to date; the extent to which she expects to be in a position to respond favourably; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":911,"content":"<p>I would like to inform the Deputy there are currently 15 Applications under various categories, currently awaiting assessment on the Esinet Administration Application, in regards to the Summer Works Scheme for the County of Kildare .<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in December 2020 I announced details of the schools that will receive funding in summer 2021 in respect of applications submitted for Roof Works (Category 2) in Primary schools and Toilet Facilities (Category 6) in Primary and Post Primary schools..<\/p>  <p>  Commensurate with the level of funding set aside for the Scheme, applications are being assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the Circular accompanying the Scheme.

It is the aim of my Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. <\/p>  <p>  At post-primary level, there are a number of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English. <\/p>  <p>  The decision on which particular text to use rests with the school itself. They can choose whichever text best suits the context of their teaching and their students. <\/p>  <p>  At national level a variety of factors influence the selection of prescribed texts including the merit of the text on grounds of excellence, the aspiration to achieve social and cultural diversity and inclusivity, the age appropriateness of texts, as well as practical factors, such as availability and cost. As prescribed lists are developed from year to year, additional factors come to the fore and influence the choices made. In addition, newly published authors are considered for inclusion. Contemporary issues and world events also impact on prescription.<\/p>  <p>  The prescribed text list working groups for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English is informed and guided by Criteria for the Selection of Texts which aims to achieve a balance between classic and contemporary texts; Irish and non-Irish authorship; seeks gender balance in authorship and representation; embraces diversity and inclusion; accessibility of texts; general suitability and comparative potential. <\/p>  <p>  The text list working groups are convened by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) Education Officer for the subject in question. Participation in the group is on a voluntary basis. In general, the group comprises teachers, third level lecturers, staff from relevant support services\/support agencies and experts in children&rsquo;s and young adult literature. The rationale for the approach taken towards the generation of text lists is that it is a highly deliberative and time-intensive process.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving a balanced list of texts remains a challenging and worthwhile endeavour and work continues to create a broadly balanced, diverse and inclusive list every year. For example, the most recently published list of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle English is current for the student cohorts 2018-21, 2019-22 and 2020&ndash;23. This list will be reviewed in the coming months and made available to schools for the 2021-24 cohort. In a similar way, the text list for Leaving Certificate English will be reviewed for the cohort of students who will study for the Leaving Certificate examination in 2024. <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA regularly receives recommendations and advice about texts for consideration and inclusion in courses. Parents, teachers, and students can make suggestions through an online facility which can be accessed on the NCCA website: All submissions are considered by the relevant text list group as they review and update the selection of texts for subsequent groups of students. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the NCCA is currently undertaking research on international best practice with regard to text selection and this will inform the ongoing review of the NCCA&rsquo;s selection of texts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","counter":915,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT03800"},{"type":"question","counter":916,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[25499\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the increasing concern of a shortage in places, long waiting lists and the number of students with no place identified in second-level schools in north County Dublin for September 2021; and the action she is taking to resolve the issues.","asker":"1551","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":917,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas including school planning areas in North County Dublin.<\/p><p>Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:<\/p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place  to a number of schools in the area<\/p><p>- School of choice &ndash;  pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town\/area<\/p><p>- Some towns\/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school there are not available to all pupils<\/p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area<\/p><p>Until these issues are discussed with the relevant school authorities the true extent of any capacity issue will only become known.<\/p><p>Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons in North County Dublin, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":918,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":919,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[25500\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300085#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the consideration that has been given to a moratorium on the reduction of teacher and SNA allocation numbers in any school in September 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":920,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of mainstream staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.<\/p>  <p>  For the 2021\/22 school year, an improvement of one point in the appointment threshold in primary schools has been introduced and schools will be provided with class teachers on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils which is a historical low ratio.

Feedback from schools and inspectors on the inspections carried out to date has been positive overall and principals have generally welcomed the opportunity to engage in professional dialogue with inspectors on the work of their school in the pandemic context. <\/p>  <p>As outlined in the circulars above, the Inspectorate is also continuing to conduct urgent follow-through inspections, child protection-related inspections and Sustaining Safe Provision of Schools (SSPS) inspections in a sample of schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300086#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in Educational Institutions","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300086#WRU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[25505\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300086#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department will introduce legislation in relation to bullying following schools in Northern Ireland being legally required to record all incidents of bullying and alleged bullying from 1 September 2021.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":933,"content":"<p>Under my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan on Bullying, new <i>Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools <\/i>were published at the beginning of the 2013\/2014 school year, following consultation with the relevant education partners.  <\/p><p>The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its students.<\/p><p>Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 all schools are required to have in place a code of behaviour that accords with <i>Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools<\/i>as published by the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), now referred to as the Educational Welfare Service (EWS). Each school is required to have an anti-bullying policy within its overall code of behaviour.  The anti-bullying procedures are underpinned by this legal framework and all schools are required to comply with them.<\/p><p>Under the procedures, all school boards of management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy which fully complies with the requirements of these procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures along with a standardised template for recording bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular the policy must set out the school&rsquo;s procedures for investigating and dealing with bullying and the school&rsquo;s procedures for the formal noting and recording of bullying behaviour.  <\/p><p>The Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools 2017 give clear direction and guidance to school authorities and to school personnel in relation to meeting the statutory obligations under the Children First Act, 2015 and in the continued implementation within the school setting of the best practice guidance set out in the updated Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017.  The Child Protection Procedures provide that in cases of serious instances of bullying where the behaviour is regarded as possibly abusive, a referral may need to be made by the school to Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as appropriate. Where school personnel have concerns about a child arising from alleged bullying behaviour but are not sure whether to report the matter to Tusla, the school designated liaison person should seek advice from Tusla.<\/p><p>The Anti-Bullying Procedures already provide that the board of management of each school, in developing its anti-bullying policy, must formulate the policy in co-operation with both teaching and non-teaching school staff under the leadership of the principal and in consultation with parents and pupils. The need to consult with parents will be further underpinned in law once the Education (Student and Parent Charter Bill) 2019 is enacted. Under the legislation, each school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published following consultation with the education partners, including those bodies representing parents. The overall aim of the legislation is to improve the level of engagement between schools and students and their parents by inviting feedback, comment and observations from students and parents and by developing a listening culture in the school. <\/p><p>In this context one of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities.  This approach will help ensure that the various views of students and parents will be heard and responded to by schools on issues or policies including a school&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying Policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300086#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":934,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300086#WRU01400"},{"type":"question","counter":935,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[25506\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300086#WRU01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 558 of 10 March 2021, the number of schools taking part in the pilot workshops on well-being and trauma informed schooling; if the schools have been identified for the pilot; if therapists or counsellors will be made available to schools as part of this pilot; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":936,"content":"<p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) service of my Department has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which includes trauma informed approaches.

Further detail is available on Gov.ie: <i><\/i>. <\/p><p>NPHET advise that this phased plan for the months of May and June can be considered low to medium risk.

However, my Department, through Healthy Ireland, the HSE and Sport Ireland, through the Expert Working Group-Return to Sport, are committed to working with and supporting all organisations to return to activity safely and in line with current and evolving public health guidance.  There continues to be regular contact with parkrun organisers and detailed discussions regarding a return of parkrun events will commence once Government has taken decisions in relation to the re-introduction of outdoor mass participation events.<\/p><p>It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services.  <\/p><p>It is also important to note that while there is considerably less risk of transmission of COVID-19 outdoors compared to indoors, outdoors activities are not entirely risk-free. HIQA undertook an evidence review on higher-risk environments and activities for the NPHET in November 2020, drawing on national and international evidence. The Review found that while there is consistent evidence that the risk of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 is substantially lower, there is still evidence of transmission occurring in outdoor environments. This is particularly the case when there are large gatherings, where social distancing or the use of face coverings are neglected, and where there is dense congregation and mixing among groups. There are also risks linked to what might precede and follow outdoor gatherings including associated events and activities and shared travel to or from events or activities. The review is available here (<i><\/i>.) <\/p><p>Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country.

Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. <\/p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy.

Elective hospital care was curtailed for the first quarter of 2021, in line with the rapid increase in Covid-19 hospital admissions, with only critical time dependent elective procedures undertaken. <\/p>  <p>  On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local Covid-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.<\/p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity. Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. <\/p>  <p>  The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of March 2021, nationwide there were 11,629 patients waiting for an adult or child orthopaedic IPDC procedure, a reduction of 8.8% (-1,125) compared to the same period last year. At the end of March 2021 there were 80,039 waiting for a first outpatient appointment across all hospital groups, an increase of 14% (+9,937) compared to the same period last year.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in terms of the hip and knee replacements, the NTPF have advised the Department that at the end of May 2020 there were 3,042 patients waiting for such a procedure. Through focused activity, and with the support of the NTPF, at the end of March 2021 this figure had fallen by 26% to 2,252 patients. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF continues to work closely with public hospitals to arrange treatment for clinically suitable long-waiting patients on hospital outpatient and inpatient\/day case waiting lists. Year to date at the end of March 2021, the NTPF had arranged 6,951 Outpatient appointments, of which 1,971 were Orthopaedic appointments. During the same period, 5,877 patients on the Inpatient\/Day Case waiting lists had accepted offers of treatment funded by the NTPF, of which 1,221 were for Orthopaedic procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my Department that they have approved one IPDC orthopaedic initiative so far in 2021 for Galway University Hospital, which will facilitate treatment for 82 patients on orthopaedics waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040. In regard to the second operating theatre in Merlin Park University Hospital, the HSE has advised my Department that a contractor has been appointed and works commenced on site in February 2021.  Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department engage on an on-going basis with representatives from the HSE and NTPF to monitor demand for scheduled care services, through the continual surveillance of waiting lists and activity levels. &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to improve access to care, &euro;210 million of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of Covid-19, as well as to address waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  In this context the Department of Health, together with the HSE and the NTPF, is currently working on drafting a Sl&aacute;intecare multiannual waiting list plan to address backlogs in waiting lists and to bring waiting times in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300092#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300092#WRAA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[25296\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051300092#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cross-border directive orthopaedic surgery referrals made in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to date in 2021;

Action Plan 2021-2023 (May 2021).<\/p><p>In 2019 the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office (SPIO) established an Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, to guide the development of the elective sites.  The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has the following terms of reference: <\/p><p>1. To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.<\/p><p>2. To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients.<\/p><p>3. To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce\/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys).<\/p><p>4.

As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been completed and approved for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. <\/p><p>The Preliminary Business Case (PBC), in accordance with the Public Spending Code, is also under preparation.  As part of the PBC process, a site identification exercise in Dublin, Cork and Galway has begun. The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has sought site submissions from members of the public, the HSE and Land Development Agency. Sites submitted will go through a two-stage evaluation process to examine their suitability, including a multi-criteria assessment and cost effectiveness assessment with a view to the Preliminary Business Case recommending a single preferred site option in each of the three locations.

This is true regardless of the separation distance between the project and the European site(s).  <\/p><p>A likely zone of impact is used in order to identify those European Sites to be specifically addressed during screening. In making a decision regarding the likelihood of a project having a significant effect on a European Site(s), all European Sites within a certain radius (or &lsquo;likely zone of impact&rsquo;) should be considered at screening stage, in addition to hydrologically-connected European Sites.  For example, in relation to a Special Protection Area, it is important to consider whether the project area lies within the foraging distance of bird species for which that SPA was designated, and many of these foraging distances exceed 3km.  After considering a range of inputs including NPWS guidance, feedback from the FAC and advice from the Department's environmental consultants, this was set at 15km for forestry applications which is also the standard generally used for applications in other sectors. <\/p><p>In determining the foraging distance of bird species, the Scottish Natural Heritage publication (2016) Assessing Connectivity with Special Protection Areas (SPAs) Guidance (version 3) was among the reference material used.

The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Regulation 2016\/429.  All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export after a physical inspection of the bees and their packaging has taken place.

While the European Commission has noted that a member state may at national level decide whether or not to give legal protection to a sub-species and to take the necessary conservation measures to protect it, the importation of bees is subject to EU regulation on intra community trade, any legal protection that would contravene that trade would need to be scientifically robust and also be justified and proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge the important contribution bees make to agriculture and biodiversity as both pollinators and honey producers. In this regard, my Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations.
