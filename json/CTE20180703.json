I graduated from UCC in 1972 with a degree in electrical engineering and later from UCG with a master's degree in business administration.<\/p> <p>  My business career has allowed me to see much of the world.  I spent the first nine years working with General Electric in Shannon, County Clare.  I then worked with Verbatim in Limerick in growing the start-up company in green fields for the first five years of its history, before moving to Geneva in Switzerland for two years to become its senior vice president for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  I spent the years from 1987 to 2000 in the United States as executive vice president at Eastman Kodak and president and CEO of the Verbatim Corporation.  I returned to Ireland in 2000 to take up the role of executive vice president for Dell's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  I worked there for eight wonderful years.<\/p> <p>  My family and I put down roots in Limerick when I moved to work in Shannon.  I bought a farm in Croom in 1985.  I have had an interest in horses all of my life.  The farm is my passion and it is where I breed thoroughbreds, some of which I keep to race and some of which I send to the sales.  I have been a non-executive director of Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, since 2004 and chairman since 2012.  I have been chairman of Musgrave Group since 1 January this year, having served on the board of the company since 2010.  I am also on the board of a Canadian company, Finning International, and chairman of its governance committee.  It is the largest global dealer of Caterpillar machinery.  I also have my own company, Prodigium.  My love for business is matched by my passion for thoroughbred horses.  To have the opportunity to serve as chairman of Horse Racing Ireland at a key juncture in the history of the racing industry is truly an honour.<\/p><p>If my business travels around the world have taught me anything it is that Ireland is a global leader when it comes to breeding thoroughbred horses to race.  I assure the committee that Ireland's reputation for producing skilled people, as the most brilliant handlers of horses, is renowned all over the world.<\/p><p> Ireland is the second largest producer of bloodstock by value in the world, second only to America, and the third highest producer of live foals in the world.  Those statistics are backed up by a report produced by Deloitte last year, which measured the contribution to the Irish economy of racing and breeding at &euro;1.84 billion and the number of jobs directly and indirectly supported by racing at 28,900.<\/p><p> At the start of this journey I am pleased to come before the committee this afternoon to express HRI's gratitude to our elected representatives for the support the industry has received over the years.  The Deloitte report shows that investment made by the State in horse racing pays off by many multiples in terms of return to the Exchequer and additional employment throughout rural Ireland.<\/p><p> One of my ambitions in my term as chairman will be to continue to strengthen the role that thoroughbred racing and breeding plays in the towns and villages of the State.  On the track Ireland is world class, competes with the best and enjoys success from here to Melbourne and back, but this is a challenging and perilous time for the industry in Ireland with a number of significant challenges, including Brexit.  Horse racing is run on an all-island basis in Ireland, and 80% of our bloodstock exports are to Britain.<\/p><p> Horse Racing Ireland is putting the final touches to an ambitious strategic plan for 2019-23.  The extra investment that we are proposing will protect our current position, allow the industry to grow and will enhance the return to the Exchequer and to local economies all over the State.  This strategic plan will address the various challenges faced by our industry.<\/p><p> Given the keen interest that the committee has shown in our industry, I would encourage and invite any members who have suggestions, ideas, priorities or objectives for Irish racing&rsquo;s five-year future, to please engage with us.  The suggestions would be very welcome.<\/p><p> My priorities for the next five years are very focused but interwoven.  The key issue for me will be to drive excellence through people by putting people first.  It is also crucial that we have our equine welfare side of the business right and the integrity of what we do is secure.  If we have the people right and the horses right, then we have the perfect raw materials.<\/p><p> There is also the matter of making sure the investment and funding is appropriate.  A sustainable funding model for Irish racing is critical to allow the future planning that an industry of this size needs.  This will lead to greater participation in our industry, more horses in training and more people involved in ownership.  There will be a knock-on effect of broadening the interest and appeal of racing in Ireland and increasing its profile.<\/p><p> That is probably enough about me at this point, and I am happy to answer any questions the Chairman or the members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicky Hartery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>A number of Deputies have indicated in the following order: Deputies Pringle, Penrose and McConalogue.

As Mr. Hartery has said, it will be a difficult time with Brexit and so on coming down the tracks.<\/p> <p>  With regard to harness racing, and Irish Harness Racing Association, which has been in existence in Ireland for the last few years also, will that sport have some impact on Horse Racing Ireland? I am not sure what the role is, and perhaps Mr. Hartery could expand on that.  That sport has the potential to develop and grow but it needs the use of tracks.  I believe that all aspects of horse racing should be working in partnership and working together but this does not seem to be happening on the ground in the context of harness racing.

Ireland is prominent in the sport internationally, especially in Britain and France.  The horse racing industry in Ireland is spread geographically right across the 32 counties.  There are currently some 6,500 breeders.  Mr. Hartery will be aware that there was a big lull during the economic recession and it sapped a lot of the confidence out of the industry, but we still have 26 racecourses.  I know that the chief executive of HRI is familiar with my interest in Kilbeggan Racecourse.  Mr. Hartery will know that we are very eager for some significant investment to be forthcoming.

It certainly represents a significant threat to the horse racing and horse breeding industry in Ireland because the UK is our biggest export market, ahead of France.  Some of our racecourses are across the Border.  Has Mr. Hartery thought about this?  Has the board prepared a plan?  Is HRI working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this?  What has been the interaction between HRI and the British Horseracing Authority in the United Kingdom, and with Gallop France?  Interaction with these organisations is very important to us in this context.  I know that HRI is in a difficult position.  Like everybody else, they are in a vacuum, but HRI is a major industry that has significant North, South, east and west relationships.<\/p> <p>  The question I have for Mr. Hartery is one that often comes up at this committee - including at our last meeting when the HRI chief executive referred to it - on the significant funding provided by the people of Ireland to the horse racing industry.  Mr. Hartery has expressed his appreciation for that today, and it has cross-party support.  In a recent presentation to this committee the HRI chief executive spoke of a long-term and sustainable funding structure to be put in place.  Has Mr. Hartery given any thought as to what a long-term sustainable funding structure for the industry would look like?<\/p> <p>  The industry is not just very important for breeders, jockeys and those within the industry; it also makes a major contribution to rural areas in particular.  There were big events at places such as the Curragh at the weekend but smaller racecourses such as Ballinrobe, Roscommon and Kilbeggan are tremendously important to the midlands.  There have been some noteworthy successes.  One of our most significant owners lives right in the heart of that area, just outside Mullingar at the Gigginstown House stud.  We have a great history there but it is important that it is maintained, retained and supported.<\/p><p>One has to look for ways to do that, such as taxation, including the betting tax and whatever will come forward, as a sustainable way of ensuring that the industry will be promoted and financed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#G00600","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.

I would be interested in their further thoughts on how they believe funding should be invested and what the best way to spend it is.

I have been to Kilbeggan, had a horse run in Kilbeggan and it is a nice place to be and to race.  With regard to Brexit, in other non-HRI businesses, it is also a big deal.  My process relating to Brexit is to prepare for the worst.  I will talk the committee through some of that.  I have spent time with the team at HRI on this.  It is one of the biggest and most pressing challenges facing Irish industry and breeding.  The ability to move horses between the three big nations is really important, as the Deputy mentioned, with France Galop, the UK and us in Ireland.  Between the three individual groups and the departments of agriculture in each country, a high healthcare standard has developed and was presented to Brussels last Thursday.  That also has the support of the other 15%, which are Italy, Germany, Scandinavian countries, Spain and others.  It has united support across Europe.  That is so horses can move freely within Europe.  That part of it has been done.  Activity has started to complete the issue of - using airline terminology - priority boarding, so that when it comes to a port, a horse is not delayed for a number of hours but moves through on priority.  That part of the logistics has to be completed and will be done.  Those are the two critical items.  That is assuming a hard Brexit.  That means there will be special categorisation for thoroughbred horses.<\/p> <p>  The next issue related to funding.  A key issue with funding is that there are a number of areas where there is funding, such as the foal levy, which I have been paying into for years, and that should be retained.  We are looking at every mechanism that provides revenue to HRI.  That is one.  The stallion masters provide approximately &euro;2.5 million a year, which goes into European breeders' funds and so on.  The other issue which I am interested in, when I look at this as a balanced portfolio, is that we collected approximately &euro;70 million for HRI in 2001 on &euro;1 billion of revenue in betting.  Today, we collect &euro;51 million on &euro;5 billion.  There is a significant imbalance somewhere.  I am not saying that it should go up by a certain amount or anything like that.  We need a balanced portfolio.  There needs to be more give where we, as HRI, can fully fund ourselves.  The UK tax is 2.5%.  We have an excellent product.  How do we stay competitive?  In France, they take 7.5% in the pari-mutuel to fund their organisation.  If an Irish horse is racing in France, one misses the premiums which are worth another 80% of the winnings.  I raced there recently and the winning horse, which was just ahead of us, had &euro;17,500 of a win take and approximately &euro;12,500 between premiums.  It is quite significant.  There are different models in different countries.  I am not saying there is any outcome from this but HRI will look at the different models used, and at what is best for Horse Racing Ireland so that we can give it and the industry in Ireland an advantage as we go forward.<\/p> <p>  I may have answered both Deputy McConalogue's questions at the same time.  Does he want to ask something else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicky Hartery"},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I was asking about the appropriate use of investment, how Mr. Hartery feels funding should be invested in the sector to get the best result, and what his thoughts would be on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#H01100","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530628200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>A big investment which I inherit coming in is the Curragh.

It is one of our biggest spends so we should make sure we get an up-to-date record of where the budget is.  I assume that we are close to it.  That is a big spend, and another big investment should be the Equine Centre.  To have an industry like ours and to be a leader in the global market, we need to have the capabilities for drug testing and everything related to that.

That is not their fault, but many people are leaving the industry because they do not get sufficient returns, especially on the training side.  Does Mr. Hartery expect the industry to be able to galvanise support to increase the returns for those who are in difficulty and those at the lower end of the scale?  The more trainers the industry loses, the worse it will be because it will be more centralised with only a few trainers.

As I said, they are an integral part of the atmosphere at race meetings in Ireland.  If we are to increase revenue, we must consider their position.  We cannot compare a track bookmaker with a major multinational because it is not a level playing field.  Ladbrokes and other companies are on the rails now.  We must try to preserve the unique atmosphere of the betting ring.  If we try to increase revenue from betting, a concept which I would not disagree with, we have to ensure track bookmakers are able to survive.  We must not impose an unsustainable tax on their turnover.<\/p><p>In regard to attendances at race meetings, Galway in a couple of weeks' time will be thronged to the rafters.  At marquee meetings, whether it is Leopardstown at Christmas or whatever, attendance is good.  However, at the ordinary, mundane meetings, attendance is dropping significantly.  At my local track in Thurles on a Thursday in the winter time, there will hardly be the people looking after the horses that are racing.  Those tracks are struggling.  Is anything envisaged to promote attendance at what we would describe as bread and butter meetings?  Many of the provincial tracks are under extreme pressure, especially in the winter.  They are an important part of the industry.  Does Horse Racing Ireland have plans to help these provincial winter tracks?<\/p><p>Thankfully, prize money is good in this country, but there is a division between the flat and national hunt prize money<b>. <\/b>What does Mr. Hartery see as a suitable ratio?  As Senator Lawlor said, a small number of trainers and big operations dominate flat racing.  A few trainers also dominate the national hunt racing scene.  What are Horse Racing Ireland's plans regarding prize money for both flat and national hunt racing?  Point-to-point racing is becoming more and more important for trainers with one, two, five or six horses as they try to get customers.  It plays a significant part in the national hunt scene. <b><\/b>This sector needs to be protected and we must ensure it feeds into the national hunt.  The prize money and support available for the sector will be important.<\/p><p>I would also like syndicate ownership to be promoted.  Levels of syndicate ownership declined alarmingly after the boom, although it is starting to recover.  There is no better way to promote the product we have to sell.  If five, ten or 15 lads are involved in the ownership of a horse, they and their families will attend race meetings.  I would like greater incentives to be provided for syndicate ownership.  For a limited outlay, one can become a part of the whole atmosphere.  There is no greater kick than having a winner.  I would like to see syndicate ownership promoted as much as possible. <\/p><p>Drug-testing was referred to and I strongly recommend investment in it because our reputation is paramount.  I encourage co-operation with Bord na gCon in this area because greyhound and horse racing are similar industries, including in respect of funding.  If we had a State laboratory covering both sports, there could be many synergies.  That is the best approach because the industry needs its integrity to be enhanced.  The integrity of horse racing is at a very high level, without question, and the level of testing is superb, but investment in testing would be welcome.  I encourage Horse Racing Ireland to engage in talks with Bord na gCon on a joint venture in this area, which would be very welcome.<\/p><p>I agree with Deputy Pringle's comments about harness racing and its future.  Representatives of the harness racing sector have made impressive presentations to the joint committee.  They believe they could get a competitive industry up and running with a small budget.  I would like to see greater co-operation with that sector, which has potential and will not encroach on other parts of the horse racing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#J00500","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hartery for coming in today and sharing with us his extensive CV in the business world, and his interest in horse racing.<\/p> <p>  One of the major issues over the years has been the amount of taxpayers' money that goes into the horse racing industry.  The industry receives a significant sum every year.  I accept that this investment delivers a return in the sense that the activity in the horse racing industry generates tax revenue.  Mr. Hartery referred to the impact of betting tax.  Something clearly needs to be done in this area, although I will not get into what this should be.  How can Horse Racing Ireland make the industry sustainable and enable it to pay its own way and more?  As everyone will appreciate, it is difficult to make an argument for allocating the best part of &euro;100 million to the horse and greyhound racing industries every year when hundreds of people are lying on hospital trolleys and we have a housing crisis and many other problems in society.  Much of this money is used for prize money and we see that the people in the winner's enclosure are not exactly on the poverty line.  This issue needs to be addressed by the industry.<\/p> <p>  On attendance at race meetings, Galway in a couple of weeks' time will be thronged to the rafters.  At marquee meetings, whether it is Leopardstown at Christmas or whatever, the attendance is very good.  Attendance at the ordinary, mundane meetings, however, is dropping significantly.  At my local track, Thurles, on a Thursday in winter, there will barely be the people looking after the horses racing.  Those tracks are struggling.  Is anything envisaged which could promote the attendance at those bread-and-butter meetings, as we would call them?  Many of these provisional tracks are under extreme pressure, especially in the winter time.  They are an important part of the industry.  Are there any plans to try to help those provincial winter tracks<\/p><p>Given his past experience, perhaps Mr. Hartery is the person to do it.  It would also be a difficulty if we were to see an increase in betting tax and it went to pay for what people would see as an extravagance.  There needs to be a sense that value for money would be coming from it.  That brings me back to the point made that in the past decade or two it has become an industry in which it is very much the high flyers who are seen to take the cream, while a lot of those at the bottom such as the smaller trainers and breeders are struggling and finding it difficult to survive.  A serious attempt needs to be made to rebalance that position.  Simply creating a level playing field would not do that because the bigger players are so dominant.  Measures have to be put in place to ensure the people at the bottom will be given more than a fair chance to rise and do better in that respect.<\/p><p> The issue of the working conditions of stable staff has come up at different times.  Their remuneration needs to be looked at.  There is a need to follow best practice because I know someone from my part of the country who works in the industry, loves horses and works with them nearly 20 hours a day, but they are not very well paid for the amount of energy and effort put in.  While we all appreciate it is an industry in which there is a need for consistency and the same people to handle horses all of the time, at the same time there is an issue that cannot be ignored and which needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> I refer to Brexit which Mr. Hartery mentioned as something that will clearly be a problem which we will all have to face.  I live in a Border area and know that any issue of trade across the Border or the channel will be difficult.  It does not only concern the movement of horses for racing, it also concerns the sale over and back of horses and other animals.  Mr. Hartery mentioned healthcare standards, but from the point of view of public policy, does he believe there are particular areas at which we should be looking to enhance it to ensure Brexit will not have too serious or negative an impact on the horse racing industry?<\/p><p> I mention the relationship with bookmakers.  A lot of small bookmakers feel squeezed because of the way the situation has developed during the years.  It is another issue that clearly needs serious attention quickly because it is not appropriate that they have ended up in the situation in which they find themselves.<\/p><p> A lot of the big problems we have had during the years have had to do with management and how things are run.  Certainly, the perception is that things could have been run a lot better.  As the new person in the position of chairman, I would appreciate an assurance from Mr. Hartery that he has a handle on the matter and understands that these issues need to be dealt with appropriately. <\/p><p> hT lot of the big problems that we have had down the years have been around management and how things are run.

If I miss one of them, please come back to me on it.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Senator Anthony Lawlor who asked three questions, the first of which was about the time I could give to this role.  I gave a lot of consideration to it before I decided to take it, particularly the time I could give to it.  It is not the degree of difficulty that is the issue but giving the role the appropriate amount of time.  I committed to giving it the appropriate time to make sure it would be done properly and that at the end of my term the organisation would be in a far better place.  My predecessor did a fine job and I hope that when I pass on the baton, the next person will get it in better shape again.  I hope every chairman who comes after me will have the same attitude to the role.  That is my attitude to it.<\/p> <p>  On betting tax, I appreciate the support.  The CEO and I will come back to the committee on the issue.  It is not about picking out one element but about ensuring people are fully aware of all of the different elements of fundraising within HRI, including the foal levy, and where we might be in that regard in the next two to five years.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's third question was about the few dominant trainers.  It is interesting because on a weekly basis fields will include the offspring of the top sires and the top trainers and so forth will be seen.  The other day I was reflecting on the fact that of the top ten trainers, probably only three of them were there five to seven years ago.  That movement will happen every five to ten years.  There are quite a number of new young trainers coming through in Ireland; therefore, in time there is a changing of the guard.  As in all industries, that puts pressure on people to perform better, which can be good, as much as anything else.  I look at what is going on and the standards being set in Ireland are exceptionally good.  I do not only look at Aidan O'Brien as being Irish.  It is a global picture.  Irish trained horses race in England, France and the United States.  In the past they only raced in Ireland and the United Kingdom, but lots of trainers now race their horses in the United States and France.  Therefore, it is a different playing pitch, but changes will happen in time.  They are the dynamics of the industry.  The key owners in the seventies were probably not the key owners in the eighties.  They are definitely not the key owners today.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about harness racing.  The one thing I will say about it is that I have been to the Hambletonian twice.  As I have seen it in the United States in particular - New Jersey is a great state for it - I am quite familiar with it and, therefore, the question is interesting for me.  I have not, however, looked into it in Ireland.  In response to what the first Deputy asked of me, I do not see or hear a lot about it, but we will pick up on it.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that there is support for drug testing, about which Deputy Jackie Cahill spoke.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the points made about syndicate ownership.  I saw how effective it could be in getting more people involved in the industry.<\/p> <p>  The division of prize money between flat and national hunt racing was the subject of another question.  I have not looked into it, but I will take the question away and look at it.<\/p> <p>  Attendances are back to where they were pre the recession.  The annual figure is about 1.3 million, of which the festival meetings, including those in Galway, Listowel, Punchestown and Leopardstown at Christmas time, account for about 40%.  There are about seven festival meetings which the include the Fairyhouse festival meeting at Easter.  Attendances at all other tracks account for 60% of the figure.  The comment that attendances are lower at tracks such as Thurles is reasonable and accurate.  It is something that will be looked at because it is all part of promoting the industry.<\/p><p>The one thing we need to be careful of is the idea of people who attend race meetings being the few who are well-heeled and go racing and so forth.  When one looks at many sports, and I have lived in Switzerland where motor car racing and the motor show in Geneva are big things, one gets the same principals, but they are a minute number of the 28,900, or let us say 30,000, people involved in the industry in Ireland.  As has been said, there are many people who do a lot of hard work in the industry locally on the stud farms preparing horses for racing and so forth.  We need to keep that in mind.<\/p><p> The other question from Deputy Cahill was on bookmakers.  The bookmakers' stands at the racecourses are an endangered species.  When we consider the opportunities we have to support the industry we will take that into account and I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.  I have noted what he said.<\/p><p> I might not have Deputy Martin Kenny's questions in the order he asked them.  He referred to small breeders struggling and a rebalance.  Many of the small breeders I see in my part of the world multitask, if I can put it that way.  They might be doing cattle, milk or whatever and they do a great deal of multitasking.  Unless one has a specific capability in the breeding lines and the like, the industry will pay for what it wants, which is what the industry does, and it does not pay for what it does not want.  That will always be a difficulty.  It is an industry that very much refreshes itself.  For example, right after the recession in 2008, 2009 and 2010 there was a significant drop in foal numbers in the country.  We had significant overproduction and what happens then is the bottom 10% or 15% of the industry falls out.  That will happen as that is just the dynamics of an industry.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to working conditions in stables.  One of the things I have got myself and our CEO involved in is staffing.  We realise it is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job and so forth but currently Kieran Mulvey is pulling the employers, the employee groups and HRI together and is working that diligently.  We hope to have an appropriate outcome emerge from that process by the end of this year and hopefully even sooner.  This is a work in progress and I do not wish to say more on it at this point.  However, I know there is a good programme in place and I hope to see it come out on the right side for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicky Hartery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Deputy Kenny also made a point about the amount of taxpayers' money going to the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#L00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530628200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>My objective is to see the industry becoming self-funding, if that is the right word, in order that the funding in the industry is used to promote a better industry, higher foal numbers, better breeding and, as a result, more people employed.

I believe the chairman has a couple of key responsibilities.  One is strategy.  One makes sure the strategy is appropriate for the business one is running.  The second thing is talent.  That is something I have yet to get into within HRI and to work with the team there, but my understanding from the outgoing chairman is that he was quite pleased with the management and so forth.

In September 2017, the Minister announced the commencement of such a review through the establishment of a review committee to carry it out and to furnish a report.  The report was to include recommendations on the legislation governing, and the future operation of, the appeals office and was to be completed by the end of that year<i>. <\/i>The process was to feature<i><\/i>consultation with relevant stakeholders<i>.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The committee comprised Niamh O&rsquo;Donoghue, former Secretary General, Department of Social Protection and chairperson; Padraig Gibbons, former chairman of Connacht Gold and former president of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society; and Paud Evans, former principal officer in the Department of Agriculture.  Written submissions were invited and 20 submissions were received by the closing date.<br\/><br\/>In February 2018 the report was published for consideration by the relevant stakeholders, including this joint committee, explaining that the recommendations were currently under consideration by the Department, particularly with regard to legislative changes that may be required to give effect to them.  The consultation process that has been under way is now drawing to a close.  To date, there has been a submission from this committee and we have had meetings with the director and a senior staff member in the appeals office, staff in the payments and entitlement areas and a recent meeting with six farm organisations after last week&rsquo;s farmers&rsquo; charter meeting.  This committee meeting will help to further inform the process.<br\/><br\/>We are aware through the committee's letter of 2 May that it has the following issues of concern: the status of the independence of the chairperson of the appeals panel; the independence from the Department of any legal advice sought by the appeals panel; and the validity of inspections that are not carried out in accordance with terms, conditions and guidelines of the scheme.  Furthermore, the committee also indicated that its engagement will be ongoing in reviewing the legislation as it progresses through the Oireachtas.  The Minister is interested in the further views of the committee and would like to ensure all interested parties have had their say on the contents of this important report.<br\/><br\/>There were 31 recommendations in total but I will highlight some of the key points in the report.  The most significant recommendation is probably the introduction of an independent agricultural appeals review panel.  Others include a fee to be set by the independent review panel for the progression of an appeal to the second tier; the Department should continue to broaden the pool from which appeals officers are recruited; a structured programme of knowledge and skills-based training and development to be put in place; the appeals office should publish a principles-based code of practice; the appeals office should put structures in place to ensure that appellants can be advised of the progress of their appeal; greater engagement by the appeals office with the farmers&rsquo; charter of rights monitoring committee; the appeals office should consider recording oral hearings and the possible use of video conferencing; the introduction of a plain English booklet giving details of the decision-making process may be given to all claimants; the time limit for submission of correspondence to be extended from 14 to 21 days; the appeals officer may have discretion as to whether to hold an oral hearing as necessary; arrangements are to be made to appoint a deputy director with potentially a greater remit; the Department should look at the robustness of its internal review process; the report of a finding by the appeals office should be timely and comprehensive in the interest of informing both the Department and the appellant; and the regulations should be amended to require both parties to submit a list of attendees that they intend to have at an oral hearing and that any new evidence should be submitted two weeks before the date of the hearing.<br\/><br\/>Subject to a positive decision by the Minister, certain of these recommendations can, in effect, be put in place relatively quickly.  I would cite as possible examples areas such as the introduction of greater levels of training; the publication of more detailed information; a better emphasis on timeliness; and the procurement of additional IT resources etc.  The biggest challenges arising from the recommendations, such as the introduction of an agricultural appeals review panel comprising the director of the appeals office and non-departmental staff, would require primary legislation to be introduced.<br\/><br\/>A preliminary legal view has also been put forward that the recording of proceedings would need a legislative change as section 8(2) of the Agricultural Appeals Act currently requires that hearings be held in private.  The use of video recording and communication tools such as Skype would need to be carefully examined legally, particularly with regard to the use of personal information and GDPR ramifications.  Consideration will also have to be given to the practical aspects of the recommended changes.  For instance, there would be logistical issues and increased administration<i><\/i>arising from having four additional persons review each case.  Currently, there is no second oral hearing and appeals to the director are based on fact or on law.  The recommendations seem to make provision for the independent review panel to meet the parties again.<br\/><br\/>If I can paraphrase the consultation that has taken place to date, I would say that the groups that have given their views have been broadly supportive of the contents and recommendations of the report.  The farm organisations spoke of the need to strengthen the independence of the appeals office and the importance of open access to an oral appeal.  The appeals office itself gave the view that any changes must not compromise the authority and responsibility of that office and, in particular, of the director.  The appeals office welcomed the recommendations of a six-month timescale for appeals and the use of a code of practice.  Staff within the paying agency wanted greater certainty on the timescale of appeals and to curtail the late introduction of new evidence.<br\/><br\/>It would be remiss of me to suggest that all recommendations in the report have been met with universal agreement.  The farm organisations are opposed to the introduction of fees for further appeals.  Reservations have also been expressed about the use of recording and video conferencing from the point of view of the stress it might cause, the legal and privacy implications and its efficacy as a communications tool.  I am happy to discuss these views with the committee.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the next steps, the views of all parties will be summarised and sent in a submission to the Minister on the best way to implement the report.<\/p><p>There will be an emphasis on those recommendations that can be put in place quickly.  Definitive legal advice will be sought on the best way to proceed with those recommendations that require primary or secondary legislation.  I thank the committee members for their time and we are happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Smyth.

I have been asking questions about this issue for a long time on this committee.  It was a condition of the Programme for a Partnership Government that there would be a review of the appeals process.  The reality on the ground is that farmers have lost confidence in the appeals process and the procedures surrounding it.  Our job is twofold.  We want to restore farmers' confidence in the process and we can do that by ensuring there is fairness in the process.  We need an independent chairman.  With all due respect to the personnel of the Department, an independent chair is not someone who has spent his or her life working in the Department.  Many people with the required CV are not former employees of the Department.  I am not casting aspersions on anyone's character but we are trying to restore confidence and that is one of the essential things that needs to be done first.<\/p> <p>  We also need an appeals structure with farmer representation.  I refer to the model for tuberculosis, TB, compensation.  If there is a dispute over TB compensation, an appeal can be made to a body which has farmer representation.  In general, that has worked well and there are few complaints when people use that appeals process.  People are happy with the findings.  I know of one case lately involving a high economic breeding index, EBI, herd.  The farmer was not at all happy with the valuation system.  An appeal was made to that body and it was felt there was a fair hearing.  Farmers' representation on the appeals body added greatly to the credibility of the process.<\/p> <p>  When an inspection is carried out and it is proven subsequently that it was not carried out correctly according to the terms and conditions of the scheme, then no sanction should be applied.  From past experience, unfortunately, in a significant number of cases inspections have not been carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions and substantial fines have ensued.  If there is a Garda prosecution and everything is not done correctly, when it goes to court it is automatically thrown out without any debate.  The same thing has to happen here.  Department officials who are carrying out inspections have a rule book.  If it is seen that they have not adhered to that when carrying out the inspection, if it has not been in accordance with what is laid down in black and white, then that inspection has to be null and void.  That is absolutely essential to restoring farmers' confidence in this whole process.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the review.  We have our Agriculture Appeals Act and we have a job of work to do now.  Those changes would go a long way towards restoring farmers' confidence and ensuring that in future farmers would be confident of getting a fair hearing.  It is important to state that we are talking about a minority of cases where people feel they have to go for appeals - not every farmer that is going down this route.  Where they do go down this route we have had much publicity in the last couple of weeks about questions being asked.  In my neck of the woods, this issue goes back five, six, seven and eight years.  <\/p> <p>  We were very critical and I produced figures here which showed the levels of fines in one part of Tipperary versus the other part was at a ratio of 3:1.  In my view, there were not more non-compliant farmers in north Tipperary than south Tipperary, and definitely not to that ratio.  There were significant issues.  Many of those individual farmers, unfortunately, went the appeals route and the outcome was not what I would consider satisfactory.  Those are my recommendations and they come from extensive consultation with farmers who have been in throes of this and feel they have been unfairly treated by the whole process.  If we could get those three things from this review, we will be going a long way down the road to restoring confidence and ensuring that farmers will feel this appeals process will give them an fair outcome.  They might not always like the outcome they get but if they get a fair hearing, that is what is being asked for and demanded. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#N00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Smyth for his presentation, which I read earlier.  I come across appeals regularly and the issue is that people often feel they are up against it.  They already have a negative finding before they go for the appeal, they are trying to prove themselves and the people they meet are very much on the side of Department.  That is generally the way people look at it.  I welcome the report and its recommendations.  I have an issue with the fee being put in place because in the vast majority of cases the people looking for an appeal are looking for something to which they are entitled.  They feel they are being done out of that wrongly or they would not be appealing.  Suggesting a fee should be put on them would be an unfair penalty to place on people who already feel penalised by the system.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Cahill's suggestion that the chair should be somebody independent.  I do not think it has to be anyone with any particular knowledge of agriculture or the agricultural sector.  It can be someone from outside.  There are many eminent people who, with a short bit of training up in the areas of the various schemes, would be able to come up to the standard and deliver.  Most of the recommendations are clear and sensible.  One simple example that I came across recently is where a person was reported to the local authority, wrongly, for spreading slurry.  The local authority came out, did a short investigation and then sent a report off to the Department.  That person feels wrongly done by because he or she had not breached anything.  They also feel that the investigation by the local authority was simply to try to substantiate the report that was already sent in.  <\/p> <p>  Those of us who live in rural Ireland, and in the farming community, know that when somebody reports somebody else it usually has nothing to do with the issue reported.  It is about some other gripe from long ago.  That is often the case in many of these instances.  When something like that goes to an appeal it is difficult to sort out the issue.  There needs to be a clear sense that people will get a fair hearing.  Many people in the farming sector feel they do not at present.  I have come across several people who, when they have taken a beating on something, say they would not even bother appealing it because they do not think they would get a hearing.  That is a bad thing.  People should feel confident, if they feel they are in the right about something, that they should be able to proceed.  <\/p> <p>  Even if the appeals mechanism does not work out for them, they still have recourse to go to a solicitor and go to court. That is a reality that many people do not understand.  They do not know they have that right.  They should take that right when necessary, if they feel strongly enough about it.  That should not, however, be necessary.  The appeals mechanism should be strong enough to deal with it and deal with it adequately.  As Deputy Cahill said, people often may not get the result they want.<\/p><p>However, although they may not agree with the decision, most people would get some level of satisfaction from being afforded a fair hearing.  I welcome the work which has been done by the Department but I do not agree with people who are already being penalised being charged a fee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#N00400","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Smyth and Ms O'Connell for attending.  On the appeals system, part of the problem relates to how the schemes are structured and the lack of flexibility regarding a mistake a person may make and the resultant penalty.  Where do common sense and reasonableness come into the process?  At all stages that an application is with the Department or under appeal everything is ruled by absolutely strict and rigid terms and conditions which often do not take cognisance of the realities and difficulties for people participating in schemes.  We all understand the need for terms, conditions and rules but there must be some level of flexibility and understanding.  That is where many of the difficulties originate.  What capacity is there for flexibility within the system and the various schemes?  Surely we can address that issue in terms of how the system and the terms and conditions are set up.<\/p> <p>  In the past two weeks, I have become aware of three relevant examples.  A mistake relating to a tier 1 condition was made by an adviser in the submission of a GLAS application for a small rented plot of land, with the result that the landowner was unable to avail of the scheme after the first year.  The full amount of &euro;5,000 was paid in that year but although all the tier 2 actions were carried out in respect of the land, the farmer has been excluded from the GLAS scheme, must repay &euro;5,000 and will miss out on &euro;25,000 potential income over the five-year period.  No flexibility was shown in respect of that mistake.  Considering the extent to which such people depend on EU schemes for income, that decision is extremely inflexible and unfair to that full-time small farmer.<\/p> <p>  An appeal was lodged regarding a carbon navigator not being submitted on time to the beef data and genomics programme.  The person carried it out, wrongly believed it had been submitted and must now repay &euro;2,000 and has been excluded from the scheme.  Again, there was no capacity for flexibility in that regard.<\/p> <p>  An application to TAMS relating to a low-emissions slurry spreader initially purchased on hire purchase was refused.  The applicant later bought the spreader, which cost &euro;40,000, outright in order to claim on it and is within the allowed three-year time period for to submit a claim but may not do so.  That young farmer is out of pocket for 60% of the value of the spreader and has been left in an exceptionally unenviable position.<\/p> <p>  People considering appeals in respect of land and eligibility matters are not issued payment until those appeals are heard.  Due to the fact that they do not wish to be without the payment until the completion of the process, they may accept a small penalty imposed on them although they think it unjust.  In what way can there be more flexibility and understanding to better reflect the reality of farming and understand the impact that decisions based on very strict terms and conditions can have on the farming community?  That is key.<\/p> <p>  On the implementation of the recommendations and timelines, the committee has reported and the recommendations have been made but there is no clear timeline for implementation.  Can we ensure that clear timelines will be put in place for what will be implemented and when?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018070300002#O00200","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1530628200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.

Has there been an increase in appeals relating to specific areas or schemes such as the beef data and genomics programme referred to by Deputy McConalogue, GLAS or any other scheme?

Dr. Smyth stated that some recommendations can be implemented now or reasonably shortly but the key issues will require legislation.  He referred to the fact that only the director may deal with individual cases, of which the committee was aware.  If there is an increase in the number of cases, how will one person be able to get through them in a timely manner?  That will be a major issue down the line.<\/p> <p>  Whether we like it or not, legislation may progress slowly through the Houses and agricultural matters may not be afforded much priority, although all present would like them to be.  It will take time to increase the priority of legislation in this area, although this issue is of importance.  How can the necessary changes be progressed at a far quicker rate than is currently the case?  The year-long consultation process is coming to an end.

Deputy McConalogue stated that a small mistake by a farmer should not result in a big penalty.

They are not used to it and it is one of the things that should be borne in mind when we speak about video conferences and so on.  It is difficult enough for farmers to turn up at appeals hearings.  One can see why video conferencing might be a more efficient way of doing things but for a person who is not used to dealing with a public process, sitting in a Department office in front of a video camera might make the process even more difficult.  It must be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  In the context of who is chosen as the chairman, one of the problems is that the legislation is awfully complex.

This is borne of the complexity of the schemes that are in place.  There are certain things we have to deliver, and this is one reason we have problems.

The association is the representative body for the licensed haulage sector in Ireland.  We estimate that 47,200 people are employed in the road freight, distribution and logistics sectors in Ireland, accounting for 2.5% of total national employment.  Our members play a key role in the sector. <\/p> <p>  I will outline the economic context for the road haulage sector.  Merchandise trade is a very important component of the economy.  Exports and imports of goods are key to the functioning of the economy, both from a consumer and a business perspective.  In 2017 Ireland&rsquo;s merchandise exports totalled &euro;122 billion, while its merchandise imports totalled &euro;79 billion.  When combined, total merchandise trade was equivalent to 68% of gross domestic product, GDP, in 2017.  The road haulage sector is central to this two-way trade in goods and, consequently, the proper functioning of the economy.  As such, it is essential for Ireland&rsquo;s future growth and prosperity that the sector be as efficient and effective as possible.  IRHA members are a key cog in the efficient functioning of a vibrant and dynamic economy.  In a very real sense, we can be described as the wheels of Irish trade and commerce.<\/p> <p>  The operating environment for road hauliers is very challenging and the sector is also facing many pressures and uncertainties in the coming years.  Our challenges include increasing costs, especially fuel costs, but also high insurance premia and new daily levies being imposed in the United Kingdom on Irish trucks which do not apply to UK trucks operating here.  Very high levels of competition are driving down margins to unsustainably low levels.  New regulatory impositions are leading to a tougher and costlier operating environment.  One change resulted in some members' loading capacity being reduced by 7%.  There is a labour shortage which is really stretching our members' capacity to recruit drivers.  Currency fluctuations, in particular, recent movements in the value of sterling, are having a negative impact on many operators.  The difficulties exporters are facing are being directly visited on hauliers who are having to deal with lower business volumes. <\/p> <p>  Future challenges are even more concerning, including Brexit which poses enormous potential challenges for the sector.  Ireland is the only EU country that shares a land border with the United Kingdom.  Each week there is &euro;1.2 billion worth of trade in goods and services between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  In addition, more than 80% of road freight to continental Europe travels through the United Kingdom.  Anything that might act to disrupt this trade such as adverse currency movements or border controls would be damaging to Irish road haulage activities and, consequently, the Irish economy. <\/p> <p>  The risks to the economy from a hard Brexit are very clear.  The road haulage sector is the one that is most exposed to Brexit and already feeling its impact through increased currency differentials, a loss of business confidence and declining credit for future investment in rolling stock and support services.  The road haulage industry is at the forefront of the economic relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland; hence, it looks to be the most vulnerable and exposed sector in the event that there is a negative Brexit outcome.  Policy makers need to ensure this vital component of Irish economic life is supported to the greatest extent possible.  One way of supporting the sector is to ensure we will not introduce new domestically conceived charges, taxes or rules which would add to the challenges we face as a sector.  We cannot deal fully with the uncertainties that are emerging from what increasingly looks like a chaotic Brexit, but we can ensure we do not make the economic position of exposed sectors any worse through misdirected or inappropriate new rules or charges.<\/p> <p>  Fuel costs are a very significant overhead for licensed hauliers, representing up to 35% of the operating cost of a vehicle.  Licensed hauliers have no alternative but to use diesel.  They do not have alternative fuel sources which they can choose as prices fluctuate.  Diesel is the most cost effective carbon and energy efficient fuel for use in heavy road transport.  It offers the best combination of power, torque and cost efficiency.  Other fuels require more space such as gas or weight such as batteries, reducing payload and increasing the number of journeys.  Even in the USA where cars and light commercial vehicles are predominately run on gasoline, heavy duty trucks run on diesel.  Furthermore, as a fuel, diesel has slower combustion characteristics compared to petrol.  Diesel vehicles produce higher torque at lower speeds, the primary requirement of a heavy goods vehicle.  High torque is needed to move heavy loads.  The diesel engine remains the only viable option for hauliers.  In simple terms, diesel is the only readily available fuel source for hauliers and any increase in its cost represents a direct and immediate charge on the cost of business for a haulier.  A proposal to equalise the excise duty between diesel and petrol would lead to an immediate 10% increase in fuel costs for our members.<\/p> <p>  Regrettably many of the public policy debates on this issue are conducted with a very poor understanding of the complex issues underpinning the use of diesel by the haulage sector.  One particularly poor piece of analysis was conducted by the ESRI which was published in February.  The report suggests a worryingly misinformed point of view in favour of the recent narrative that sees diesel as a bad fuel type, no matter what the circumstances.  The IRHA contends that the significant analytical flaws and lack of objectivity demonstrated in the report should preclude its use to inform Government taxation policy on fuel excise levels.  It is certainly not fit for that purpose.  The report completely misses the point that the road haulage industry has no alternative but to use diesel and that modern trucks are leading the way in slashing air quality pollution levels.  It also ignores the vast investment made by truck manufacturers in designing highly efficient diesel engines in line with Euro 6 emission standards. <\/p> <p>  I will now address sustainable transport modes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>As there are only a couple of minutes left to make the remaining points in the opening statement, will Ms Murphy paraphrase one or two points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#D00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530630000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for that guidance.<\/p> <p>  There have been huge investments made by truck manufacturers to reduce air quality pollutant levels to near zero.  For instance, new Euro 6 engines which have been fitted in commercial vehicles constructed since 2014 actually deliver an exhaust particle content which is comparable and, at times, cleaner than ambient air.  In the real world the testing and compliance of heavy good vehicles have proved to be far better than for cars for which emissions cheating devices were discovered.  It is partly due to heavy good vehicles being more expensive and requiring more physical space that manufacturers were enabled to fit the best technological solutions to meet the standards required.  Only 10% of Euro 6 cars meet emissions limits in real world driving conditions.  Therefore, in short, a simplistic analysis which proposes that excise duty on petrol and diesel be equalised in order that the price of diesel would increase would do nothing for the environmental sustainability of the national road haulage fleet, other than taking trucks off the road as haulage businesses failed owing to excessive fuel costs.  Fuel price equalisation between diesel and petrol would not produce any positive environmental benefit from the national road haulage fleet but would inflict grievous financial damage on a sector that is already facing huge costs and massive uncertainty. <\/p> <p>  The revised diesel rebate scheme was introduced in 2013 by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  The intention behind the scheme was to sustain operators through fluctuating oil prices and bring certainty to the cost base for haulage operators when contracting to provide haulage services.  This certainty, in turn, benefits exporters by helping to control transport costs and reduce at least one aspect of the variable component of costs.  Under the scheme, the Revenue Commissioners repay a portion of the mineral oil tax on fuel provided that the purchaser is a qualifying road transport operator who meets specific requirements.  The scheme has not worked effectively since it was introduced, as the applicable floor for diesel rebates was set too high at &euro;1 per litre.  The IRHA believes that for the scheme to make a substantial difference in current conditions, the floor should be reduced to 85 cent per litre.<\/p><p>Additionally, we believe that the maximum rebate available under the scheme should be increased from 7.5 cent to 15 cent per litre, with a maximum rebate of 15 cent per litre once the price of diesel reaches &euro;1.  Such a move would alleviate cost pressures on the sector, benefit the Irish Exchequer by reducing fuel tourism and bring certainty for Irish exporters by helping to control and predict stable transport costs.  This proposal is based on current conditions.  Should equalisation of the excise duty between diesel and petrol be contemplated, the diesel rebate scheme must be introduced to recompense the haulage industry in full for that increase.<\/p><p> The IRHA believes that rather than demonising diesel engines in a non-thinking and fad driven fashion, the ESRI and the environmental lobby should call on the State and the European Union to make the most of the solutions brought to market by Euro 6 emission standards, by encouraging the acceleration of fleet renewal and-or fleet retrofitting.  Retrofitting to Euro 6 standards was undertaken on a grand scale by Transport for London and proved to be extremely successful.<\/p><p> The IRHA hopes that in budget 2019, the Government, when determining appropriate budgetary measures, will take account of the strategic importance of the licensed road haulage sector and note the precarious operating environment applying at present and the threats coming at the sector from Brexit.  In particular, we believe the current economic context requires no increase in fuel costs for hauliers by way of taxation and necessitates a recalibration of the diesel rebate scheme to levels that are applicable in other EU countries and which will assist licensed hauliers to plan for the extremely challenging period ahead. <\/p><p> I will be pleased to answer any questions members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#E00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy for her opening statement.

I do not want to name anybody but it is well known in the sector.  We have never missed a Brexit forum and the estimate is that the reduction would be 20% in the event of a hard Brexit.<\/p> <p>  What I am here to discuss today is the combined effect of excise equalisation on diesel and petrol and Brexit.  European Union countries such as Belgium and France already have a fuel rebate scheme in place.  This is known as an essential user rebate.  The essential user is somebody such as a haulier who does not have an alternative.  I receive texts every day about this.  In Belgium, for example, which has a similar if not identical excise regime to Ireland, the rebate to a haulier on the price of diesel is 22 cent per litre.  If one equalises the system, the rebate in Ireland is approximately 0.05 cent, less than 1 cent.  Already a Belgian haulier, operating in the European mainland has an advantage of 22 cent per litre of fuel over us.  If one adds diesel equalisation, it contributes another 12 cent on top of that.<\/p> <p>  Our environment will become absolutely untenable.  It is not sustainable.  Without equalisation we need the fuel rebate in the next budget.  With equalisation, that must also be catered for within the realm of the fuel rebate because the essential user does not have an alternative.  Enprova, the body charged with implementing obligations under Article 7 of the energy efficiency directive of 2012, has stated that diesel is the cleanest and most efficient fuel for long distance trucks and trucks of 40 tonnes capacity.  This is the expert body saying this.  The IRHA is saying that hauliers are under significant pressure, none of which we can do anything about.  Brexit is driving much of this pressure through currency fluctuation.  The environment in which IRHA members are operating is very stressful.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>People want predictability and diesel car drivers thought they had predictability in 2008.

The report referred to 140 fiscal measures that would have an environmental impact.  Our concern relates to two pages of the report that deal with the diesel rebate scheme.  It is important, therefore, to ensure no one misunderstands our position as one of criticism of the general tenor of the report.  Our criticism is of the account the report gives of the diesel rebate scheme only.  Professor Morgenroth's conclusion on the diesel rebate scheme is that, somehow, giving the scheme to Irish haulage operators resulted in them driving more and using more diesel.  That is a fundamentally misconceived notion.  Haulage operators drive the minimum required distance needed to deliver and collect goods.  Common sense would suggest that is the case.  A large part of dealing with a haulage operation is to ensure fuel efficiency at all times, because burning fuel is a cost.<\/p> <p>  Professor Morgenroth explained in the report how he came to his conclusion on this matter.  He stated he applied a price elasticity factor taken from the National Roads Authority to suggest that an increase in the cost of diesel would change behaviour and that hauliers would switch to another type of fuel.  Those two factors do not apply to an Irish road haulage operator for the simple reason that the haulier will not drive any more or any less and he will not be able to switch his truck to another fuel type because it does not exist or is not a viable option.<\/p><p>Therefore price elasticity does not apply.

I could be wrong on this, but this is my understanding.  The policy to change from petrol to diesel in cars was to reduce CO2 emissions.  Effectively whether it is based on the Euro 6 standard or whatever, diesel is effectively low on CO2 emissions.  However, having switched over a vast quantity of cars, the particulate pollution, which is the particulates in the exhaust emissions that cause problems particularly to big European cities with very little air movement during warm summer periods of summer, massively mushroomed.  It is two different forms of pollution.  I am not sure whether diesel engines - the particulate pollution that we are talking about there - my understanding is that it is not a main contributing thing.  If we shift completely away from diesel engines back to cars, we will reduce particulates pollution so we will purify the air in the immediate city, probably Dublin only, but we will actually run the risk of driving up CO2 emissions unless the shift was done to electric vehicles.  Even going back to petrol vehicles would run the risk for us.  That is my understanding of the evidence we were previously given on that.

I will answer his questions in succession.  No, we were not consulted by the ESRI and we were taken aback by the report.  As far as I am aware, it was commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Mr. Goodwin explained about its assertion on the basis that we had a fuel rebate.  I might add that at the time in which the report and study were undertaken, we were not in receipt of the fuel rebate.  It only kicks in at a certain level so we had not been in receipt of it.  That was the reason for the disgruntlement about the report.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about Euro 6 cars.  I cannot comment on that for obvious reasons.  The point I made about AdBlue is that this is what we are doing and it makes us more green.  It does little for efficiency but it certainly helps with emissions.  Trucks have cost a lot more at the manufacturing stage in the process of developing this system.  One is looking at about &euro;27,000 of an increase as well as an exhaust system that does not last as long and has to be replenished after four to five years at a huge cost - somewhere between &euro;5,000 and &euro;8,000, if one purchased a truck with a Euro 6 engine.  Again, in relation to the French, the cost of getting off the island of Ireland for a haulage operator is about 30% of the general cost.  It equates to the fuel costs.  If one is going to the UK, that can be reduced to 20%, as the costs increase when one goes further afield to mainland Europe.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that we are not here to discuss congestion, which was Deputy Breathnach's last question, but I did speak to him about it at a recent forum in Drogheda.  One initiative that could improve the entire situation, in particular emissions, is by having a dedicated truck lane without barriers.  The cost of a truck stopping at a barrier is a litre of fuel.  Today's cost is approximately &euro;1.12.  We have put that to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which does not often listen to what we have to say.  That is a huge cost both to the operator and from a CO2 perspective.  The M1 in particular has barrier tolling.  We do not need or want to sit on the M50 burning fuel when it is 35% of our business outlay.  There are solutions but because of the public private partnership and the 30 year contract that is in place, nobody is prepared to spend the money, but if we want a holistic approach, as Deputy Pearse Doherty said, and we want to cure something once and for all, then we have to spend money.  Unfortunately, we no longer have it to spend because of all of the regulatory impositions that have been put on us in recent years and with Brexit coming down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>What about fuel tourism?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#H01400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530630000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Breathnach's question about trucks versus the equivalent Euro 6 car, I will refer to the following information.

Most trucks are operating in Third World countries.  We are all in the same world.  Whatever good or bad is in them, they will operate for a long time because they have massive engines.  What I know about these new engines is that they are great.  AdBlue costs a lot of money.  If something happens to these engines, they are way more expensive to repair.  Fellows have told me that they are not repairable.  They have also stated that the engines have to be replaced if something goes wrong because it is so costly to repair them.<\/p> <p>  I am glad we have been given the presentation.  Some Deputies seemed to exit very fast when they realised the lorries of today hardly create any emissions or any damage to the country.

I am amazed by the way Governments and Ministers change their advice.  In 2007, we were advised to buy diesel cars and there was an incentive introduced which reduced the amount of motor tax to be paid.  Now in the way one flicks a switch, we are being told that we must change and opt for electric cars.  People who do not know what they are talking about are even suggesting it for lorries.

We are delighted to present the views of IBEC members in advance of budget 2019.  Before I address some of the specific priorities from a broad business perspective, I would like to share the insights into how we regard the Irish economy to be performing, as relayed to us by our members from over 40 sectors of the economy.  We continue to experience very good trading conditions in the economy.  If we consider the main drivers of economic growth, we note the consumer economy is performing very strongly.  Our export markets are doing very well, with the exception of the United Kingdom.  Pretty much every other developed market is performing very strongly.  We estimate that the growth rate of the UK economy is probably about two percentage points below what it should be currently given the strength of the overall global economy.  Notwithstanding that, export demand is very good.  The third main driver of the economy is investment.  We see a strong increase in investment both from the business sector in terms of capital deepening that is occurring across industry and in respect of a much-needed recovery in construction activity.<\/p> <p>  When we consider the economy in the context of the latest observable data, we note it is performing strongly.  It is, however, very much a rear-view perspective on the economy, to a significant degree.  When we look ahead we are quite concerned about the external pressures we now see emerging.  We see real risks to our global trading system, as we have known it for so many decades.  It has been a bedrock of the Irish economy and has helped us prosper in respect of international trade and internationalisation.  The economy has not yet felt the impacts of Brexit, whatever they will be.  We see a significant risk on the horizon.  The third risk, and perhaps the most significant, is that we are now witnessing the most rapid decline in our competitive position that we have seen in a decade and a half.  The cost base for Irish business is increasing very rapidly.  We are experiencing severe capacity constraints in the economy in the context of labour and other resources.  Irish business is rapidly losing competitiveness.  That is the context in which we approach budget 2019.<\/p> <p>  I will mention five specific priorities we would like to set before the committee this afternoon.  We may discuss other issues during questions and answers.<\/p> <p>  First, we believe this is a budget that should deliver a step change in the supports for indigenous business.  We urgently need some brave and bold moves to achieve a better balanced economy to really bolster the SME and indigenous sectors.  That will help to protect us against some of the international threats to the Irish economic model that we see emerging.  Specifically, we are proposing that capital gains tax for entrepreneurs be set at a flat rate of 12.5%, and we would move beyond the current restrictive regime we have.  Also for indigenous business and entrepreneurs, we propose that Ireland follow the lead of Sweden by introducing a much more meaningful share-based remuneration scheme for start-up and SME firms to help them to attract and retain talent.  That is a real pressure point for the indigenous sector, particularly the start-up sector.  We should adjust the stamp duty regime on equity to have a more diversified range of funding options for the indigenous sector.  We should move with a much more ambitious programme of capital allowances to encourage indigenous businesses to invest more in capital and improve automation and to help them to be better prepared for Brexit.  That is the platform for the indigenous sector.<\/p> <p>  Second, let me make some remarks on the international traded sector, particularly the inward investment sector.  This has long been the bedrock of the Irish economy.  Notwithstanding our objectives to achieve better economic growth, we must recognise how important the foreign direct investment sector is.  We also need to be realistic about the challenges we now face as a result of US tax reform.  The US tax reform of the past year has been highly significant in terms of the Irish business model.  We no longer enjoy the type of competitive advantage we had in the past in terms of being able to win and retain mobile investment projects. <\/p> <p>  Specifically in the upcoming budget, we will be looking for certainty on our corporation tax regime.  We probably regard that as the most important element of the regime in order that business can be given certainty that allows it to plan.  While many US tax reforms have been very attractive, there are some questions remaining over the long-term certainty of the US corporate tax reform regime.  In particular, we point out the need to have the administration and functioning of our research and development tax credit scheme, which supports research and development activity in both indigenous and multinational business and which is really a key pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s international attractiveness, streamlined and improved and the need to make it as accessible as possible for all businesses.  There is a very significant opportunity now for Ireland to be a world leader in robotics and increased automation in industry.  We would like to see some dedicated schemes to help us accelerate in that domain.<\/p> <p>  The third priority, which is associated with a key challenge we see across all our sectors, concerns the ability of business to attract and retain talent.  We are now approaching an unemployment rate of just 5%.  We have a very tight talent and labour market at the moment.  Probably the most significant challenge facing businesses is that they are struggling to get and keep the right type of staff to meet strong demand.  With regard to what we believe we can do in budget 2019, we think some income tax reform needs to be delivered.  In particular, workers on average earnings should not be taxed at the higher rate.  That would be our primary income tax reform priority for the budget.  We really need to do more to help all businesses, large and small, to attract and retain talent through a meaningful share-based remuneration model.  Ireland simply does not compare well with other jurisdictions in terms of the taxation of share benefits.  This needs to be radically reformed.  A key factor, which is driving quality-of-life concerns we have in the context of the Irish labour market, relates to housing.  In recent weeks, IBEC has published a major report on the housing challenges we face.  Specifically in budget 2019, we will be favouring a move towards a new site valuation tax encompassing the existing residential property tax, the vacant site levy and other development charges on business.  That would lead to a much more efficient use of land.  It really is the high cost of land in the Irish economy that is driving our uncompetitive position in respect of housing, affordability and availability.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, we believe sustainability and our environmental challenges will become a much higher priority for our members.  Business is very keen to embrace the opportunities provided by the circular economy, in particular.  Some specifics we believe can be achieved in budget 2019 include long-term certainty on the tax treatment of electric vehicles and much more effective planning for low-emission and zero-emission vehicles for bus and rail transport.  We want to see much more effective funding provided for renewable heat technology.<\/p><p>The funding available to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for retrofitting existing building stock should be doubled.<\/p><p> On the broad fiscal position for the budget, as I said in my opening remarks, Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position is being eroded rapidly.  It is time to be cautious on the economy.  We favour a prudent budgetary stance.  It would be right not to add to any overheating pressure which might appear to be emerging in the economy.  However, we do not support the principle of the rainy day fund; rather, we support a prudent budget that is not excessively expansionary.  When it comes to the rainy day fund, there are existing pressures elsewhere on public expenditure, specifically in the higher education sector, through which there is a storm ripping.  The university rankings are falling significantly and we are experiencing reputational damage internationally.  This is leaving us ill-prepared to face a future downturn in the economy.  The best way to protect its sustainability is to invest now in infrastructure and the education system.  We have a plan in place for infrastructure under the national development plan and the ten-year capital plan.  However, we have no plan in place to address the crisis in funding in the higher education sector.  We urge the committee to support our position that we take a prudent budgetary stance but instead of putting the money into a rainy day fund, it should be ring-fenced to tackle the crisis in the higher education sector which we are experiencing.<\/p><p> This afternoon we saw corporation tax receipts in the first half of the year come in at &euro;335 million more than expected.  Over five years corporation tax receipts will most likely have jumped from &euro;4 billion to &euro;9 billion.  We need to ask ourselves what are we doing with the additional resources coming into the Exchequer and how can we continue to allow the level of under-investment we are seeing, in particular in the higher education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018070300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>The issue of the tax treatment of electric vehicles came up at one of the branch-out sessions last week at the national economic dialogue.

When we talk to Swedish colleagues in BusinessEurope, one sees the impact of the regime, particularly for small companies.  We have done it very well for multinationals in that we have an attractive regime in place for them.  However, when one looks at the tax regime for indigenous companies, we have the third highest capital gains tax rate in the OECD and the highest rate of stamp duty on shares for indigenous companies listed on the Stock Exchange.  It is the highest in the world and double the second highest rate.  We have a high share options tax rate, particularly for smaller firms.  Last year the Government introduced the key employee engagement programme, KEEP.  However, the feedback from members suggests there has been no take-up of it because of the restrictions.

Very often the focus is excessively on the cost agenda.  Costs obviously matter.  We need to keep our labour costs in line with what our competitors are doing.  We need wage increases in the economy, but they need to be moderate, sustainable and in line with those of our competitors.  By and large, that is what we have seen to date as the economy is recovering.  However, we are concerned that the labour market is getting so tight that we need to be cautious in imposing any other cost, either regulation or other costs, that will impact on payroll.<br\/><br\/>The cost of insurance is a source of significant concern for business.  Listening to the previous session, the cost of transport and getting goods off the island, particularly in the context of Brexit, is a concern.<br\/><br\/>From a productivity perspective, we would like to see more being done to support the indigenous sector in the context of its talent and management capacity.  We mentioned trying to help companies to take advantage of the new technology in automation and robotics.  Very often it is much more complex than just buying the latest high-tech kit.  It can be a management capacity challenge which can require extensive upgrading and investment across the technology systems of a business.  It might be about generating awareness, particularly in the indigenous SME sector, of the available new technologies.<br\/><br\/>On making much better use of the research and development tax credit, one of our specific recommendations to help more SMEs to use it is to have a more streamlined <i>pro forma<\/i>approach to it.  We also recommend reducing the administration involved for companies below a certain size to make it more accessible and reduce professional services costs in availing of the credit.<br\/><br\/>On the broader issue of the value of the credit to the economy and the tax forgone, we point to the additionality in research and development activity.<\/p><p>Extensive research with our members has shown a substantial return to the Exchequer from the cost benefit of the research and development tax credit.  We have estimates for that economic return.  The Government also continues to see this surge in corporate tax revenue.  That is indicative of continuing higher quality business activity in the Irish economy and much of that goes back to us growing our innovation capacity and our research and development activity.  There is a tax forgone element of the research and development tax credit but it is creating a significant amount of additionality for the economy.

More recently, the Department of Finance did work on it last year which showed that about 40% of all the research and development that takes place in the economy is supported by the credit.  It supports about &euro;2 of research and development for every &euro;1 we are spending on the tax credit itself, or a little more than that.  That is really high when we compare our credit to those in the UK or other countries where a similar kind of analysis has been done.  It is about &euro;1.50 for every &euro;1 spent there, so ours is much more efficient.  It does not just help bring more research and development here.  It is also becoming a more important part of bringing FDI - and high quality FDI - here in the first place.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned changes in the US tax reform.  The headline rate of 12.5% is still important but it is becoming less important as competitors in the UK, the US and elsewhere close in on that 12.5%.  To bring the high value jobs now, the next step up in the food chain of FDI, we need those research and development supports in place.  Companies are looking to get smart people and those kinds of research and developments in the State as well as more investment in third level.  They want to have the capacity to push out those skills and to work together on research and development.  <\/p> <p>  On the cost of the research and development changes we are suggesting, many of them are administrative changes particularly aimed at SMEs.  Many of the changes would not have a huge cost.  It is partly about administration, partly about how scientific advisers - who are under the research and development tax credit - are appointed, and who takes part in that, and also the consistency and certainty of the credit.  It does not have to cost a huge amount of money to make the credit better because the credit as a tax incentive is pretty good and attractive.  Its operation, however, may not be.

FDI is hugely important as are the tax receipts and how we use them, as Mr. O'Brien mentioned.

It is common in the tech sector, in particular, but it could probably be more common across many different areas.  It is a problem in Ireland in particular because we have this huge sector - it is like the problem the League of Ireland faces keeping good footballers.  There is a huge, very profitable and productive sector in Ireland and it is very difficult to keep good staff even if a company has them and trains them.  Being able to give them shares in the company will help retain management talent and also overcome some of those issues around not being able to pay the same wages.<\/p> <p>  The London School of Economics has done comparative work on management skills in Irish indigenous companies versus companies elsewhere.  We are down with Greece and Portugal in a European context and near India and Brazil in a global context.  We are probably the third lowest in the EU in respect of management skills available.  Our multinationals have really good skills.  We are producing many skilled people but they are not going into the indigenous sector.  That remains a major problem.<\/p> <p>   Profitability was also spoken about and Irish indigenous firms have very low margins in the grand scheme of things.  They have a high labour share, about the second highest in the EU, and very low margins at the same time, so they pay quite a bit in wages compared to their profitability.  Then they do not have room to invest after that.<\/p><p>The role of the State to step in there is help them to invest them by giving them some kind of incentive to invest thorough the tax system or them direct grants in research and development where if one has low margins, it is very difficult to justify investment in areas like robotics that might be risky that might not work.

The tightness in the labour market is something we are observing on a weekly basis in terms of the practical decisions that businesses now have to make their operations viable.  Some businesses are reducing shifts, for example, while others are curtailing opening hours, because there is not the capacity in the economy on the supply side.  We have a supply side problem which is leading to some overheating but it is very different from what we experienced ten or 15 years ago,  but it leads us to the same place - competitiveness is being eroded quite rapidly.  We should not have an expansionary budget.  The main issue of difference is how we would take some of that money out of the economy, and not use the full budgetary space available.  Instead of putting it into a rainy day fund that will bring complexity, as the Deputy rightly said, in terms of how it will be utilised - it should be invested in a specific ring-fenced purpose in the short term, that is, to address this crisis in higher education funding.

First, I will say a few words on why I believe this Bill is needed.  We have witnessed here in Ireland and globally the effects of rising CO2 levels on our climate.  The rise in the number of extreme weather events, deadly heatwaves, prolonged droughts and record-breaking rain, are well documented.  Records are broken routinely.  The five warmest years in the global record have all come in the 2010s.  Globally we are 1o Celsius above the pre-industrial average temperature and heading fast to 1.5o Celsius.  Climate change is creating millions of climate refugees globally and impacting with devastating consequences on the lives of millions more.  It is also threatening the earth's biodiversity and accelerating the sixth great extinction event in the history of our planet.<\/p> <p>  I have been struck that in this debate opponents of this measure have not sought to cast any doubt on the issue of climate change.  On one level this is welcome.  There are few climate change deniers who will publicly challenge the scientific consensus on the cause and effects of climate change.  I note that the submissions from IBEC, the Irish Offshore Operators' Association, IOOA, and others all talk of the need to take action.  They all accept the fact that our climate is changing, that the future of energy production must be renewable and that we must reduce our emissions.  However, I can take little comfort from this widespread acceptance because there is a disconnect between accepting the science and the facts, and the unwillingness to take the steps needed.  <\/p> <p>  We will hear today from Professor John Sweeney and Dr. Amanda Slevin, who will put the climate emergency into some context, and will look at our licensing regime.<\/p><p>Next week, the witnesses will look at the feasibility of renewable energy replacing fossil fuels on the scale needed and in the time necessary.  The message from these witnesses is that radical action is possible and such radical action and policies are necessary.  The numbers do not add up for those advocates of continuing fossil fuel exploration.  We cannot burn the proved reserves of oil, gas or coal globally and hope to reach the Paris targets of rises of under 2&deg; Celsius from pre-industrial levels.  This Bill is the first step but only the first.  It does not pretend to solve the crisis or reduce emissions by itself but it sends a clear signal that Ireland is part of a global movement that is prepared to take action and deal with the use of fossil fuels.<br\/><br\/>We can look at the provisions of the Bill and what it seeks to do.  Once CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions globally are above 350 parts per million, this Bill will ensure that the Minister does not issue any licences, undertakings or leases for the exploration or extraction of fossil fuels in Ireland.  This Bill would place Ireland at the front of a global movement to tackle climate change.  The continued use of fossil fuels at the levels currently being used globally will mean we will use the global carbon budget within decades and fail to limit temp increases to under 2&deg; Celsius.  This would be a death sentence for large parts of humanity and large sections of the Earth's biodiversity.  If this does not constitute an emergency, I do not know what the definition of an emergency should be.  In acknowledging this, the Bill puts down a clear marker that the future cannot be based on fossil fuels if we wish to make the planet a habitable site for humanity and other species.<br\/><br\/>I will deal briefly with some of the criticisms and arguments against this measure.  The first is that it will harm energy security, undermine jobs in the industry and make us reliant on Russian gas in a volatile political climate.  I do not accept that there is any security, in the context of energy or otherwise, on a planet that will be 2&deg; Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial level and which is heading, on the basis of current trajectories, to being 3&deg; Celsius or 4&deg; Celsius warmer within the next generation or two.  However, let us be honest about our licensing regime as it stands and about our current and predicted use of gas and other fuels.  If there is a significant find in Irish waters, which is unlikely, it would come under existing licences issued under the 1992, 2007 or 2014 licensing terms.  Under those terms, companies are not required to sell resources back to State or use Ireland as a base for servicing.  The State will receive no royalties on any such find and our tax regime is acknowledged by all, including the Department, as among the most generous for companies anywhere in the world.<br\/><br\/>We do not use Russian gas, nor will we in the future even under current demand trends.  We meet over 50% of our gas needs from indigenous resources at Corrib and Kinsale.  The balance of our natural gas requirement is imported from Britain and our gas from Britain comes via a system of sub-sea pipelines from Scotland.  Britain has four main sources of gas, including its own offshore North Sea natural gas, which provides 35% of the gas; the Norwegian North Sea natural gas, which provides 38% of the supply; continental natural gas, which provides 15% of the supply; and imported liquified natural gas, which is 12% of the total.  The sources of our gas are therefore secure and safe and this bill will do nothing to change that.  The energy security argument is a red herring to try to justify continued exploration and use of fossil fuels.<br\/><br\/>If there was a large oil or gas find, we would be looking at a minimum of 15 to 20 years for that find to be used.  That source would last another 20-plus years.  Effectively, by continuing to explore for oil and gas, we are saying we will lock our energy and electricity systems into continued domination by fossil fuels and continued high levels of emissions.  Last year Providence Resources suggested it might find some 5 billion barrels of oil in our oceans; it did not but we can hypothesise that it did.  When burned, those 5 billion barrels would have resulted in approximately 1.5 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>.  The Druid and Drombeg field alone could, therefore, potentially have produced the equivalent of all Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at 2016 levels for at least the next quarter of a century.  That would have been a boon to the shareholders of a few companies but it would have simply added to the total levels of CO<sub>2<\/sub>in the atmosphere and undermined the switch to renewables and the needed investment in alternative policies to achieve that.  It would not have replaced Russian, Norwegian or North American gas but simply have added to them.  Is anyone seriously suggesting that we should keep looking for new sources of carbon while expecting or hoping that those areas with already proved reserves will just leave them in the ground?  That is not a serious proposition.  We need to leave 80% of known reserves of fossil fuels in the ground as searching for more will not aid our energy security.<br\/><br\/>The opponents of the Bill argue we need and will want more gas.  They say it is a transitional fuel, low in carbon emissions and can help us move to a carbon-neutral energy policy.  It us true that gas may emit less CO<sub>2<\/sub>than coal but it is not an environmentally or climate-friendly fuel.  It is a fuel with high emissions of CO<sub>2<\/sub>and a large-scale switch to gas is not a solution to climate change.  It is simply a way of the postponing the kind of radical action we need and continuing the fossil fuel infrastructure that is propelling us to catastrophic climate change.  I urge committee members to give serious consideration to the submission from Dr. John Broderick of Manchester University.  He and his colleague, Professor Kevin Anderson, who is one of world&rsquo;s leading climate scientists in the world, have argued that current levels of emissions will use up the EU's 2&deg; Celsius carbon budget in under nine years; that fossil fuels, including natural gas, have no substantial role in an EU 2&deg; Celsius energy system beyond 2035; and that within two decades fossil fuel use, including gas, must have all but ceased, with complete decarbonisation following soon after.  There is no room here for a substantial gas sector post 2035 but some submissions to the committee pretend otherwise.  If we are still extracting gas post-2035, exploring for it in the next decade and planning for it post 2050, we are saying goodbye to the Paris agreement and any hopes of achieving temperature rises under 2&deg; Celsius.  We would be admitting that we cannot stop catastrophic climate change.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font>Let us not pretend that gas is a solution to climate change when we know it is part of the problem.  Global trickery and pretence have largely been the hallmark of the response to climate change.  Carbon credits, offsets and capture and storage have all been used to avoid actually reducing fossil fuel use.  In the words of Bob Dylan, let us not talk falsely now for the hour is getting late.  We can falsify accounts for CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions all we like but the ultimate and accurate measure is the global level in the atmosphere.  We cannot fool nature.  Last year, the levels of CO<sub>2<\/sub>reached 411 parts per million, the highest in our history on the planet and the highest in perhaps over 2 million years.  Last year, we emitted the largest amounts of CO<sub>2<\/sub>from human sources in history after some 30 years of knowing the science and facts on climate change and carbon use.  It is time to stop the pretence and the falsehoods.  I put it to the committee that all these arguments on  energy security, gas as a bridging fuel, the possibility of new technology capturing and storing carbon are simply attempts to put off taking the necessary action to tackle climate change.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by saying that we in People Before Profit are open to working with all Deputies and Senators.  We are open to amendments that will strengthen the provisions of the Bill and ensure it does what it seeks to, which is to ban the exploration for fossil fuels in Ireland.  Finally, there is a small drafting error here that will need to be addressed.  The Bill refers to Part 3 of the Principal Act and it should refer to Part 2.  We are open to and welcome discussion that will see Ireland move from being a laggard, as described by the Taoiseach, to a leader in the fight against climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#B00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the overview of the Bill.

The Paris Agreement aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg; Celsius. The Paris Agreement does not specify that particular fossil fuels or other fuels must be either used or discontinued.  Its focus is on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, mitigation can be cost-effective if an integrated approach is used that includes measures to reduce the energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors and to decarbonise energy supply.  Most 2&deg; Celsius or less scenarios involve the majority of primary energy being supplied by low-carbon sources, such as renewable energy, biomass and nuclear fuel by 2050.  These scenarios also indicate declining use of oil and a wide range of usage of natural gas by 2050.<\/p> <p>  In this context, the IPCC also identified a key role for natural gas power generation as a bridge technology because energy supply greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced significantly by replacing coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas power plants.<\/p><p>The IPCC has not recommended a policy of prohibiting exploration for fossil fuels but it does advise that fugitive emissions from natural gas extraction and supply should be low or mitigated.  The committee will also recall last week's presentation by the International Energy Agency, IEA, which outlined its sustainable development scenario.  This scenario, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement, outlined the future growth in renewables, nuclear and natural gas in the global primary energy demand.  This scenario sees a need for continued investment in oil and gas projects to meet energy demand, even in deep decarbonisation scenarios.  It also identified a continuing and growing need for oil and gas as non-energy raw materials for many products. <\/p><p> The European Union has pursued an energy and climate strategy that is in line with the IPCC's advice on cost-effective mitigation.  It is a combined approach of reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and decarbonising electricity generation.  The EU is committed to reducing its emissions by 80 to 95% of 1990 levels by 2050 as part of a collective effort by developed countries.  Cost-effective ways of achieving reductions on this scale are described in the European Commission's roadmap for a low-carbon economy in 2050.  Under a range of scenarios in the roadmap, renewables reach 41% to 60% of primary energy by 2050.  At the same time, the oil and gas share of EU primary energy declines to a range of 33% to 41% of primary energy by 2050. <\/p><p> Nationally, Ireland has a long-term commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels, across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors and, in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  Our 2015 energy White Paper on Ireland's transition to a low-carbon energy future sets out a vision of a low-carbon energy system where emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95% by 2050.  The reduction will require a significant increase in the share of renewables in primary energy supply.  However, fossil fuels will still make a significant but progressively smaller contribution to Ireland's fuel mix.  Nonetheless, in this low-CO2 energy system scenario, oil and gas will account for around 24% to 48% of Ireland's primary energy supply in 2050.<\/p><p> In light of the ongoing and future requirement for oil and gas, the energy security objective remains important.  Between 1995 and 2015, the EU 28's dependence on oil imports increased from 74% to 89%.  The EU's dependence on natural gas imports increased from 43% to 69% over the same time.  Ireland has had one of the higher energy imports dependencies within the EU - for example, Ireland is 100% dependent on imports for oil.  However, the development of the Corrib gas field in 2015 demonstrates the positive impact that indigenous supplies can have on Ireland's import dependency.  Ireland went from an energy import dependency of 88% in 2015 to 69% in 2016.  In addition, this helped to lower our annual energy import bill from &euro;4.6 billion to &euro;3.4 billion in 2016.  However, gas production from the Corrib field has peaked and will decline from now on.<\/p><p> The clear message, as we transition to a low-carbon energy system compatible with the Paris Agreement, is that natural gas and oil will be significant but progressively smaller components in Europe's and Ireland's energy mix and that there will also be increasing non-energy uses for oil and gas.  The proposed ban on oil and gas exploration in Ireland can be evaluated in that context as well as against the three energy objectives of security, accessibility and sustainability.  The proposed exploration ban represents a poor policy choice for Ireland for a number of reasons.  A ban on Irish exploration fails to recognise that even as Ireland and Europe transition to a low-carbon, Paris Agreement-compatible energy system, we will still use oil and gas, most likely for aviation, marine and heavy goods transportation and for cleaner electricity, first without and later with carbon capture and storage.<\/p><p> Significantly, the proposed ban on exploration in Ireland would not reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  If the ban had already been law, it would not help Ireland reach its 2020 emissions and energy targets.  The proposed ban will not help Ireland reach its 2030 targets or the 2050 emissions reduction goal.  The proposal does not promote the decarbonisation of electricity generation as it does not encourage the use of renewable energy.  Countries with active petroleum exploration and production can also have high shares of renewable energy.  The proposed legislation would not support improved energy efficiency in any way.  A ban on Irish exploration also fails to recognise that oil and gas will continue to be used as raw materials for many useful products, such as agricultural fertiliser and pesticides, manufacturing materials, pharmaceutical and medical products and others.  In addition to the absence of any climate and energy benefits, the proposed legislation would worsen Ireland's energy security when the Corrib gas field goes into decline and leave Ireland more energy import dependent.  If an exploration ban had prevented the development of the Corrib gas field, Ireland would have spent an additional &euro;600 million on energy imports in 2016.<\/p><p> Ireland has been criticised for its lack of progress towards its 2020 targets.  However, this Bill offers nothing to reduce emissions, increase renewables, improve efficiency, increase energy security or keep our economy competitive.  In contrast, energy efficiency and renewable energy measures make essential contributions to all of the major objectives of climate and energy policies, including improved competitiveness, security of supply, sustainability and the transition to a low carbon economy.  Members will be aware that the Citizens' Assembly recently agreed a thought-provoking set of 13 recommendations to tackle climate change.  However, it was particularly notable that the Citizens' Assembly did not recommend a ban on Irish exploration for gas and oil.  Nonetheless, there is more that Ireland can do.  The national mitigation plan, the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040 represent a step-change in our approach to meeting the climate challenge.  Project Ireland 2040 sets out a &euro;22 billion climate focused investment plan over the next decade.  Actions will include a major expansion of renewable energy to produce 55% of our electricity, the removal of coal and peat fuels from electricity generation by 2030, and energy efficiency upgrades in homes, public buildings and commercial premises.<\/p><p> Finally, the Department looks forward to further consideration by the committee of achieving climate and energy objectives, including improved competitiveness, security of supply, sustainability, and the transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matthew Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Our second witness is Professor Pat Shannon from the Irish Offshore Operators Association, IOOA.

I will highlight some key points from that documentation which are particularly pertinent to today's discussion.  The IOOA recognises the need to move to a lower carbon future.  However, we believe, as is reflected in national policy, that this transition must be realistic, carefully planned and fully costed, and that gas and oil will play an important role in energy supply throughout that transition.  Overall, we believe the Bill, which proposes banning the granting of any further licences, undertakings or leases off Ireland's shores, would have no positive impact on Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p>  As a global backdrop, oil and gas provide 57% of the world's energy.  Forecasts suggest that by 2040, oil, gas, coal and the non-fossil fuels will each contribute approximately 25% of global energy.  In Ireland, the reality is we are hugely dependent on imported fuel resources.  The Bill would further increase our dependence on imported oil and gas and would threaten the security of Ireland's energy supply.  Its geographical location at the very edge of Europe makes Ireland extremely vulnerable to potential interruptions in energy supplies.  Some members of the committee may remember the impact the 1973 and 1979 oil shortages had on Ireland, with long queues for petrol and difficulties transporting goods.  The 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas dispute cut off gas supplies to south-eastern Europe for 13 days.<\/p><p>The risk has been highlighted in recent times by political instability and increasing uncertainly in both the Middle East and Russia, as well as by Brexit.  It is vital that we keep open all available energy supply options, especially indigenous oil and gas supplies, a view also recommended by the International Energy Agency.  Some 45% of our gas supplies is imported and this figure will rise if we do not find more gas.  The potential for gas supply interruptions will further increase when the United Kingdom which is a net oil and gas importer leaves the European Union.  During the cold spell earlier this year the United Kingdom, our only external source of natural gas via the gas interconnector came close to being unable to meet its own demand for gas.  Europe imports three quarters of its oil supplies and half of its gas requirements, with one third coming from Russia.  Interruptions of these supplies would be extremely damaging and costly for Ireland.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, estimates in a report that the cost of losing one day of gas-fired electricity in Ireland could be up to &euro;1 billion.  The cost of losing three months of gas-fired power could be up to &euro;80 billion, or 50% of Ireland's GDP.  These effects would be felt in all homes, schools, hospitals and throughout industry.<\/p><p> The Kinsale Head gas field which has stored strategic gas supplies will be decommissioned soon and Ireland will then hold no contingency gas reserves, further increasing the exposure to supply interruptions.  This highlights the vital role of an active exploration sector to provide indigenous supplies.  If the Bill proceeds, Ireland would lose the opportunity to have a significant revenue stream that could be used to support energy transition and job-creating opportunities in rural and maritime parts of the country.  It would undermine industry confidence in Ireland, both within and beyond the oil sector.  The use of Irish natural gas has transformed the energy and economic landscape of Ireland, being the catalyst for the creation of the national gas grid and making major contributions to regional and local economies.  Approximately &euro;30 million annually is spent in the local Cork economy as a result of the Kinsale Head gas field.  During the worst period of the recession in Ireland, the Corrib gas project provided more than 1,000 full-time jobs, while over &euro;1 billion was spent directly with over 300 Irish contracting companies.<\/p><p> Petroleum exploration and production can bring substantial benefits, foreign direct investment, jobs and income, to coastal regions away from the main urban centres.  Banning exploration will not lower greenhouse gas emissions, either in Ireland or globally.  They will probably rise owing to the need to import oil and gas from other countries, mostly outside the European Union.  Indigenous and European oil and gas resources emit 30% less CO2 than oil and gas imported from outside Europe owing to a combination of greater production efficiency and lower transport energy costs.  For Ireland, replacing such imports with indigenous gas and oil resources could result in significant emissions reductions.  The Irish Offshore Operators' Association, IOOA, believes it would be foolhardy to ban exploration when we have no realistic and reliable alternatives to the use of gas and oil.  Annual gas demand in Ireland is rising by approximately 10%, with gas being supplied to more than 26,000 businesses and over 650,000 homes throughout Ireland.  Many renewable energy forms such as wave energy are at an early stage of development, while some such as wind energy are inherently intermittent and must be supplemented by more reliable forms such as gas and oil.  Globally and in Ireland, there is clearly a requirement to replace high greenhouse gas emitting fuels such as coal with a range of cleaner natural resources and renewable energy forms, together with the deployment of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, CCS, to capture greenhouse gas emissions on a large scale.  Natural gas, in particular, has a major role to play in substituting for higher greenhouse gas emitting energy forms, while oil will continue to be important for international transport, including aviation, shipping and haulage, and in non-burning uses such as petrochemicals and feedstocks.<\/p><p> It is essential for Ireland which has a small and relatively isolated energy system to identify the appropriate energy mix that will guarantee reliability, security and affordability, while minimising damage to the economy or society.  Natural gas and oil will be required to play a key role in the security of affordable energy supplies, in addition to providing the necessary base load backup for intermittent renewable energy sources.  We are best placed to do this with indigenous gas and oil resources.  We often look for examples of countries from which we can learn to do things better.  Norway has one of the lowest low carbon economies in the world.  It is a good example of how to embrace a low carbon society, while also continuing to explore for and develop its own offshore oil and gas resources.  Revenues from oil and gas resources have played a crucial role in creating a modern Norwegian society which is a world leader in electric car sales, with continuous and significant investment in hydropower generation.<\/p><p> At a time when the outlook for Irish offshore exploration is excellent, with real momentum in investment in exploration, the IOOA believes that, by enacting this Bill, Ireland would be turning its back on the potential to have energy independence.  We would be embarking on a policy that would increasingly make us isolated from our European neighbours and more dependent on politically less stable countries to supply a significant proportion of our energy needs for the foreseeable future, in all likelihood causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by forgoing the opportunity to find and develop Irish natural resources to replace imports.  As Ireland's gas reserves deplete, it makes no sense to stop exploration and the opportunities and benefits that come with it.  Instead of banning exploration, we should, like Norway, encourage and support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Pat Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Shannon.

I am here with Dr. Neil Walker.  We are with the business group IBEC which is Ireland's largest business group.  It represents 7,000 members across a range of sectors that make up 70% of the private sector workforce in Ireland.  Its member companies are big, small, indigenous and international.  The one thing they all have in common is that they need access to a secure, affordable and sustainable energy supply.  I understand a copy of our submission has been circulated.  I will briefly talk through key concerns and why, in our view, this Bill will not have the intended environmental outcome.  It would not reduce fossil fuel consumption and could instead undermine national energy security.  We will be happy to take aquestions later.<\/p> <p>  A failure to address climate change and its main driver, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, will put the environment, our society and economic well-being at great risk.  A failure to decarbonise the energy system will lead to a continued over-reliance on energy imports.  For these reasons, IBEC fully supports the delivery of a low-carbon economy by 2050 and the transformation of the energy system.  In practice, this will mean a complete change in how we run businesses, how we get from A to B, how we heat our homes and factories and how we power the electricity system.  How we meet this objective with a growing economy and increasing population while also addressing concerns about energy security and affordability will be one of the biggest challenges of our time.  The Bill would be disruptive and affect all sectors and communities.  It is incumbent on us as a society to follow the most cost-effective route towards decarbonisation and prioritise evidence-based policy.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland we have access to world class energy and climate modelling in University College Cork which could give us an insight into how our future energy needs can be met within an increasingly constrained carbon budget, which is in keeping with the Paris Agreement and our obligations.  It is imperative that we use this resource and evidence base when making policy decisions.  I refer to the graphs on page 3 of our submission.  One can clearly see that in the modelling done to date, there is a role for natural gas in the transition and in a 2050 scenario.  Our key concern is that the Bill overlooks the important role natural gas plays today in the transition and the 2050 timeline.  It is used by over 800,000 households and businesses on the island of Ireland.  It is the primary fuel for electricity generation and also recognised as a transition fuel, both by the European Commission and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  That is because, while natural gas is a fossil fuel, it is the cleanest fossil fuel available.<\/p><p>It has application for the heat, transport and power generation sectors.  Due to its negligible levels of nitrous oxide and particulate matter, is an obvious bridging fuel for the transport sector, particularly for freight and heavy goods vehicles that make up 20% of our emissions in the transport sector, on which we have made very little progress, and particularly for vehicles and transport modes where electrification is not an option.  <\/p><p> In Ireland, natural gas plays an especially important role in electricity generation and ensuring that our electricity grid remains secure and safe.  As an island nation located on the periphery of Europe with no nuclear power generation, the flexible generation that gas provides is needed to supplement and accommodate the growing level of renewables, and intermittent renewables like solar and wind power, that we are bringing onstream.  At present there is no other obvious solution to this problem.  EirGrid has acknowledged that fact in its planning framework entitled Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios 2017 and UCC has acknowledged the same in its modelling work.<\/p><p> We need to maintain secure supplies of natural gas.  The existing Moffat interconnectors have been extremely reliable in giving us affordable natural gas.  The Corrib gas field has also given us great respite in terms of our over-reliance on imports.  However, when the Corrib field is exhausted and domestic sources cannot be used then we will have to rely on imports again.  That is a growing concern especially when we will have to increasingly look further afield for imports from non-EU and non-OECD country, particularly in a worsening geopolitical climate.  <\/p><p> As has been mentioned, the enactment of the Bill could lead to a net increase in global emissions because piped gas, which must travel long distances, and liquified natural gas have a higher carbon footprint than domestically produced gas.  <\/p><p> In summation, the security of our energy system is not just a matter for big business but is a matter for everybody as it affects local hospitals, schools, caf&eacute;s and libraries.  We must all bear this in mind and I ask the committee members to bear this fact in mind when considering the Bill.  Today, Ireland continues to have a worrying over-dependence on imported fossil fuels.  The delivery of a low carbon economy will help us to address both climate change and our over-reliance on imports.  During this transition the security of our natural gas supply still needs to be prioritised.  That is why we recommend that the Bill is not progressed at this time.  We ask the committee members to keep in mind the evidence and modelling that has been done when considering the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Minogue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I call our fourth witness who is Emeritus Professor John Sweeney from the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Unit in Maynooth University, County Kildare.

Aspirations no longer cut the mustard, in terms of our international obligations.<\/p> <p>  As members can see, the first diagram in my presentation that is displayed on screen shows the way in which Ireland's position on transitioning to a low carbon economy has lost international credibility.  This is the second of two reports.  The first report places Ireland at the lowest level, in terms of its performance in achieving its climate objectives.  The second report, which is more recent, ranked Ireland 28th out of 29 countries in Europe and just one place ahead of Poland.  These reports are important because it is quite clear that these criteria are an indication of our failure to meet the obligations that we freely entered into in 2008.  As members can see from reading what is written below the second diagram, Ireland received overwhelming support from all of the political parties represented in the European Parliament when the obligations were made.  <\/p> <p>  The Bill can help restore Ireland's credentials as well as make a significant contribution to the next hurdle, which is a very detailed national energy and climate plan.  The plan must be submitted to the Commission in draft form by the end of this year.  It is important that we consider the way in which Ireland's international reputation is at stake.  This is a litmus test.  If we want support from our European colleagues for other areas like Brexit, like a seat on the United Nations Security Council and even future relief from climate catastrophes then we must consider whether we are pulling our own weight. <\/p> <p>  The Bill makes a positive contribution to national and international climate obligations, some of which we have undertaken off our own bat and not at the behest of anybody else.  The national policy position is to have an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 of at least 80% compared with 1990 levels.  That is our national target and is one which must guide our policy. <\/p> <p>  Ireland's position is guided by our international obligations under the Paris Agreement.  The agreement has the status of an international treaty and we are obliged to conform with the objectives of the Paris obligations such as to keep warming below 2&deg; centigrade.  The diagram on the next page shows that we must have 50% global decarbonisation by the 2030s and we must move to 100% decarbonisation around the middle of this century.  Of course the Bill will not in itself achieve these goals.  Nevertheless, I believe that the Bill will encourage energy security based on renewable energy technologies.  I do not buy the arguments that we are moving into more energy and security than we had in the 1970s.  In fact, I believe that we have sufficient energy security from our existing gas field and also from the secure sources that we have in the three pipelines that connect us to the North Sea European Gas Transmission Network.  <\/p> <p>  The Corrib gas field has a lifetiime of between 15 and 20 years.  We will still be producing Corrib gas in the early 2030s and, possibly, in the late 2030s.  It is worth pointing out that North Sea oil and gas production, which we thought was depleting very quickly, has increased for the past three years.  There is a history of oil fields and gas fields having a much longer life when it comes to the crunch.  New fossil gas is incompatible with the plans to decarbonise the energy sector in Ireland.  However, it inhibits the development of new wind and solar energy.  For a while last Saturday, the UK generated the highest amount of its electricity demand from solar energy.  That is where we should be going energy wise rather than trying to return to the past.  Claims that gas supports renewable energy development are also not vindicated.  The cheapest gas generation technology is for baseload operation and not for intermittent peaking.<\/p> <p>  The Bill will position Ireland as an early mover in this area.  That stance is very important internationally for our credibility and reputation.  Ireland is no longer the fourth country after France, Belize and Costa Rica and is now the fifth because New Zealand has now joined that list of countries.<\/p> <p>  It is quite clear that coal and gas fields currently in production, without any new exploration or development, are enough to exceed our climate goals.  Therefore, we do not need to worry about new gas and oil if we want to stay below 2&deg; centigrade.  As members can see from perusing the next diagram, burning the reserves currently in operation, in terms of operating oil and gas fields alone, even without further coal combustion, will warm the world above the 1.5&deg; centigrade threshold that we are obliged to make efforts to remain below, under the Paris treaty organisation.<\/p> <p>  The exploration cycle has been mentioned here.  The Corrib gas field was discovered in 1996 or 22 years ago.  Therefore, we have a long cycle of exploration, development and production.  We are tying ourselves in to a very long period of continued fossil fuel extraction should we not pass this particular Bill.  There is a list of phases starting with exploration, appraisal, development, production and, finally, an abandonment phase.  Do we really think we can lock ourselves into these until the middle of the present century?<\/p> <p>  The global imperative of tackling climate change means that continued investment in fossil fuel runs the risk of creating stranded assets.  Investors are increasingly nervous about companies, in terms of how they will evolve to tackle the warming limit of 2&deg; centigrade for their business.  Financial regulators have endorsed the importance of the scenarios analysis for assessing climate risk.  I wish to draw the attention of members to a statement.<\/p><p>Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, stated that a carbon budget consistent with a 2&deg; Celsius target would render the vast majority of reserves stranded, meaning oil, gas and coal will be literally unburnable without expensive carbon capture technology.  We have no feasible carbon capture technology at the moment and we have had no demonstrable successes in that area.  We have very limited choices.  If we continue building fossil fuel extraction and have some success in limiting emissions, around which the noose will tighten fairly quickly, we will have only two ways out, that is, with stranded assets or climate chaos.  I would argue that managed decline is the best option in that regard.<\/p><p> The Bill will further accelerate trends which are emerging in society at a very fast rate in terms of divestment in fossil fuels, on which topic a Bill is going through these Houses.  The trend encompasses universities and foundations, including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, faith-based groups, pension funds, governmental organisations and NGOs.  It will mushroom in the next few years and we can be caught on the wrong side of history if we do not acknowledge it now.  In my submission, members will also see a statement from Bishop Tutu in which he talks about the urgent need to tackle this climate emergency.<\/p><p> Ireland spends &euro;386 million each year on fossil fuel subsidies, and this money could be much better spent on renewable technologies.  The Danish Parliament voted recently to go for 100% renewable power by 2030 and it is trying to export renewable energy.  That is very ambitious but Denmark is, in many respects, comparable to Ireland.  I will not have time to go into the details of clean air or safety, although members will see pictures of some of the problems oil and gas exploration has created in the past.  I urge the committee to seriously consider not just talking the talk but walking the walk towards a low-carbon society, as that will be the litmus test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Our fifth witness is Dr. Amanda Slevin from Queens University Belfast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#G00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530626400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>My research focuses on society-environment interactions and my PhD was the first academic study of the Irish State&rsquo;s management of gas and oil.  Subsequent publication and further research led to my book Gas, Oil and the Irish State.  I have conducted extensive research on Irish State hydrocarbon management, which has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of how things work in Ireland and the flaws in the State&rsquo;s approach.<br\/><br\/>Before focusing on hydrocarbon management, I wish to situate the Irish approach in the wider context of climate change and environmental degradation, which Professor Sweeney highlighted.  Research tells us that human activities, particularly the consumption of fossil fuels, are responsible for climate change through dangerous levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  Policies and legislation at international, European and national level seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to transition to a more sustainable future but is this enough?  Data on Ireland suggest not.  Ireland has the third highest <i>per capita<\/i>greenhouse gas emissions in EU.  This is based on 2013 figures but Professor Sweeney&rsquo;s submission suggests the performance is actually declining.  At the rate we are going we will be lucky to achieve a 1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, let alone the 20% to which we are committed.  Radical action is needed and role models for Ireland include France, New Zealand, Belize and Costa Rica, who are leading the way by banning oil and gas exploration on environmental grounds.<br\/><br\/>My written submission looks at the wider context to enable us to understand Irish hydrocarbon management and why it is problematic.  I will highlight some key features.  The State&rsquo;s approach has evolved since 1959 and has been shaped by a variety of social, economic, political ideological forces.  Four different fiscal systems apply to oil and gas exploitation, each with varying returns to the State.  The licensing system is similar that in fewer than half of the countries which have hydrocarbon exploitation globally.  This results in the privatisation of publicly owned resources in exchange for low rates of taxation.  These issues are compounded by flaws in licensing, policy and planning frameworks which cause social conflicts as so clearly demonstrated by the Corrib gas conflict.<br\/><br\/>I have provided a list of current authorisations.  Members will see there is an issue related to the length of time submissions are held by companies without bringing the resource into production.  The latest report shows that the authorisation for the Barryroe oil find remains a standard exploration licence with no reference to plans to transfer the authorisation to a petroleum lease or a lease undertaking.  That allows a private company, Providence, to maintain control over Irish resources without having expressed any plans to bring the resource into production.  Of the 18 significant discoveries identified by the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture in 2012, 15 are currently under licence and only four in production.  Of the 11 remaining authorisations or discoveries, Providence holds authorisations for seven.<br\/><br\/>These are small issues in comparison to some of the key issues surrounding the State&rsquo;s management of gas and oil.  The first big problem is Ireland&rsquo;s choice of regime.  The State, which owns the gas and oil, grants licences to and authorises oil companies to conduct exploration and production activities.  If hydrocarbons are discovered and produced, ownership of these resources are transferred from the State to companies in exchange for a pre-agreed return.  The licensing systems reflect the overall ideology toward privatisation of resources and shows a relaxed attitude towards State management and regulation.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s regime is at odds with those of other countries, which use production sharing and service contracts.  These represent the most popular approach to resource management globally.  Production sharing contracts and service contracts ensure strong State control and that the State retains full ownership while permitting companies to undertake exploitation as a service to the State, for which they are remunerated.<br\/><br\/>Some of the benefits of production sharing contracts include a higher share of taxes, royalties, associated onshore and offshore activities, and guaranteed supply.  These are benefits which Justin Keating sought to achieve in 1975 but are benefits which Norway sought from the very start of its approach to gas and oil management, when it refused to allow the transfer of State assets to private companies with very limited benefit.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s regime, companies are under no obligation to sell produced gas and oil back to the State and if they choose to do so it is at full market prices.  The Irish licensing regime for gas and oil does not guarantee security of supply.  If oil is produced offshore, the oil can be transported in tankers to other countries.  Similarly, plans for the Shannon liquid natural gas processing plant may mean gas supplies are exported to other countries without benefit to the State in terms of access to indigenous gas.<br\/><br\/>Security of supply fallacies need to be challenged, with recognition given to the weak position the State is in relating to gas and oil.  Globally, states are increasingly asserting stronger control and ownership of resources with national oil and gas companies bearing responsibility for production.  The Irish State should also reassert control over its resources, with the goal of keeping them unproduced on environmental grounds following the example of France, New Zealand, Belize and Costa Rica, particularly as the fiscal returns to the Irish State from hydrocarbon exploitation are among the lowest anywhere in the world.<br\/><br\/>The second issue with gas and oil management is the uniquely low tax terms.  The 1992 licensing terms apply to the Corrib and Seven Heads petroleum leases, six frontier exploration licences and two standard exploration licences.  Hydrocarbons produced through these authorisations are subject to a 25% tax rate against which all costs are offset.<\/p><p>This rate of taxation is one of the world's lowest.  Johnston's study of 45 fiscal regimes put Ireland's terms at the bottom of the list with the nearest terms resulting in 40% tax.  Following public outcry about these low tax rates, the 2007 terms were introduced.  These also apply a 25% tax rate with an additional between profit resource and tax of 5% to 15% which is applied to larger fields after costs have been offset.  There are two lease undertakings, 12 frontier exploration licences and four standard exploration licences which are subject to the 2007 terms.  A further two lease undertakings are also being considered on these terms and have been under consideration for a lengthy period as illustrated in the table provided.<\/p><p> In an international study of government take, which is the revenue states receive from their resources, I examined research on 153 fiscal systems and found that Ireland had the second lowest rate of return of the countries studied.  Of the countries studied, 79% demanded government take of at least 50%, which is twice the rate applied in the 1992 licensing terms and higher than the returns demanded under the 2007 terms.  The generosity of the State to oil companies is evidenced in a report of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service from 2011 which found that Ireland had the most generous tax and royalty regime.  A review of Ireland's regime in 2014 resulted in an increase of taxation for authorisations granted after 2014.  The 25% corporate tax regime rate remains joined by a petroleum production tax which can result in taxation up to 55% after costs have been accrued.  One frontier exploration licence, 31 licensing options and 18 petroleum prospecting licenses have been granted under those terms.  We have 79 outstanding authorisations at varying rates of take up to a complete maximum of 55% after costs have been offset.  That is not 55% of the value of the oil and gas, it is 55% potential tax.  Johnston estimated government take globally at approximately 70%, which is nearly three times the rate of government take under the 1992 terms and significantly higher than the 2007 and 2014 modifications.  The tax terms for Irish hydrocarbons remain low by international standards and eliminate the economic benefits from hydrocarbon exploitation.  As such, they cannot be used to justify continued hydrocarbon exploitation, in particular when one considers the environmental damage caused by hydrocarbon exploitation.  In the interests of sustainability, resources should be invested in renewable energy sources that would support Ireland's transition to a low-carbon economy.  Such changes must take place sooner rather than later if Ireland is to have any hope of meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets.<\/p><p> A third key issue involves the flaws in licensing policy and the planning framework.  Flaws in the Irish model of hydrocarbon management are further compounded by weaknesses in the licensing policy and planning frameworks as violently articulated through the Corrib gas conflict.  Deficiencies in Ireland's licensing policy and planning frameworks include a disjointed approach to sustainability, the facilitation of project splitting, the exclusion of communities from decision-making and the prioritisation of short-term economic interest over long-term societal and economic well-being.  A further issue surrounds the contradictory roles of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is tasked with promoting hydrocarbon exploitation, managing hydro-carbon activity, functioning as a resource owner and also, somehow, environmental protection in circumstances in which the production and consumption of hydrocarbon are associated with environmental degradation and contribute to climate change.  In other words, the State body responsible for responding to climate change also promotes hydrocarbon exploitation and transfers public resources to private interests, undertaking conflicting roles which do not correspond to any notion of sustainability.<\/p><p> My submission demonstrates that there are a range of interconnected issues surrounding hydrocarbon exploitation, consumption and climate change.  Given these interconnections, we must choose a pathway which is conducive to long-term sustainability.  That will involve complex topics and challenging decisions.  Ultimately, long-term sustainability will entail structural change.  In addition to the issues I have articulated in my written submission, decision makers must be cognisant of carbon lock-in which will make decarbonisation more difficult and, possibly, more expensive in the long term.  Indeed, some estimates suggest that continuing to invest in carbon-intensive technologies could increase long-term investment fourfold.  We are at an important crossroads and we need to take radical action to create a sustainable and healthy society for this and future generations.  Current production and consumption patterns cannot be sustained.  I have outlined in the table provided some of the interconnections to which I refer and will not go into detail on them.  I want to touch on a few brief issues before I conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amanda Slevin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>We are over time so Dr. Slevin might move to the wrap-up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#H00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530626400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I have challenged security of supply arguments.  They should not be used to justify the State's approach.  We have to question how we manage resources as the economic benefits are outweighed by the environmental damage.  The climate emergency measures Bill is essential as it can play a decisive role in the reduction of hydrocarbon production and consumption and encourage the redirection of investment towards renewable energy.  The Bill is complementary to and advances current climate change mitigation strategies and policies.  There is no second chance when it comes to climate change.  We must act now and we must act decisively.  Action must include banning further hydrocarbon exploitation, reducing energy consumption and properly resourcing the transition to renewable energy in a manner which is acceptable to all stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amanda Slevin"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Slevin.

I apologise for having to leave earlier but I had to speak in the D&aacute;il on the establishment of the climate action committee.  There is broad agreement now that we face a serious situation with regard to climate action and our use of fossil fuels.  With a few notable exceptions in south Kerry and the White House, we are all on board in recognising that we have a problem, which is good.  At this stage, it is about what to do.  The debate around fossil fuels and their extraction is one we have to face head on.  The approach of my party, which I have advocated, is that we have to change very quickly.  The disappointing thing is that we have not been putting the renewable industries in place to deal with this.  We have not been creating the new industries.  When I say \"we\", I refer to the State, private industry and the various sectors of the economy.  That is where we need to move to.  I have a question on alternatives to fossil fuel which the Department's representatives might like to answer.  It is about alternatives to fossil fuel in other areas like fertilisers.  Mr. Collins or one of his colleagues might address that.<\/p> <p>  Professor Sweeney highlighted that we may go into the 2030s with Corrib.  We are at least looking at 12 to 15 years of gas.  As such, we do not have security of supply there.  Of fossil fuels, it is possibly the best option in terms of current use but we need to move away from all fossil fuels.  Surely, our oversized agriculture sector and the problem we have with farm waste, food waste and other forms of waste are putting us in breach of EU regulations along with bad environmental practices.  As such, should we not be moving quickly towards biogas and biomass?<\/p><p>Do we know what potential there is in any oil or gas reserves off our shores?  Should we not recognise the potential of offshore wind?  I accept it is intermittent but it could be married with biogas and other renewable sources such as wave, wind and solar.<\/p><p> I heard the outline of IBEC's position and I have read its submission.  What concerns does IBEC have about being behind the curve in terms of not moving quickly enough into new industries, particularly with regard to stranded assets?  In other words, in a short period of time assets that are invested in old, dirty industries may not have a great value.  In fact, it might be hard to get people to invest in them as the smart investors see that the new game in town is renewables.<\/p><p> My last question is for Dr. Slevin.  She said in her presentation that gas exploration companies are under no obligation to sell the gas back to the State and that it is sold at full market price.  Obviously, there is the security of supply issue, which was highlighted by another speaker as well.  The suggestion is that we have security of supply because we have private companies drilling, but the reality is that they can sell it to whoever they wish on the world market.  How big an issue is that in terms of moving away from fossil fuels?  How much of a drag is it in moving industry and policymakers away from fossil fuels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#H00500","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530626400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Deputy Hildegarde Naughton resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eamon Ryan next.

Like Deputy Stanley, I must apologise for my absence.  It was due to an unfortunate timing circumstance as the motion on the climate committee had to be discussed and agreed in the D&aacute;il.  It is related to the debate here.  I have been frantically reading some of the submissions to prepare my questions.  I regret missing the presentations but I have a fair idea of the views after reading some of the material.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a few technical questions.  Perhaps Professor Shannon and Dr. Walker, who I know very well, or Mr. Collins from the Department will be able to help me.  Most of our oil and gas options, the licensed exploration locations, are in further distant waters.  Is that a fair summary?  My understanding is that we have searched every pocket in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea and found nothing aside from Kinsale and another pocket below.  Other than that most of our exploration is in the Porcupine and in deep distant waters.  Where do we think we will find oil and gas?  People were talking for years about how we have &euro;600 billion worth of oil and gas offshore but fortunately or unfortunately, and one can pick which is the right word, I do not believe we will strike oil or gas.  Relying on it as a security strategy is like relying on a gambler who is putting the last &euro;5 in the slot machines in Las Vegas.  That is the territory we are in.  Where do the witnesses think oil and gas might be found?  From which field will we get this great security?  If I were to offer the witnesses &euro;500 million to invest in offshore wind off the west coast or offshore oil and gas, in all honesty which economic investment would they make?<\/p> <p>  I have another question for the oil industry experts.  What is the estimated cost - I realise this depends on the field but it is possible to aggregate and estimate it - of a barrel of oil from the Atlantic?  What does the price need to be for it to come ashore?  We had an incredible demonstration from the International Energy Agency, a cheerleader for the oil and gas industry.  It mentioned figures such as $40 per barrel for shale gas in the United States.  I was amazed when the agency said it believed the cost of offshore was coming down so one could get oil or gas from the Gulf of Mexico or from Brazil for $30 or $40 per barrel.  What is the estimated cost of a barrel of oil from Irish waters?  What is the business projection of what that would have to be?<\/p> <p>  I have a final technical question.  I read IBEC's analysis in which it quotes the ESRI and UCC projection for natural gas consumption to remain steady out to 2050.  In the course of my research I was reading some of the other experts' projections for the future, an impossible task.  To take one example, the energy scenarios of Bloomberg New Energy Finance would be as good as any and are recognised by the industry as probably among the best.  Its wording refers to a dramatic fall in European gas production between now and 2050, and that is before we develop new battery technologies and take into account the ongoing contraction in the price of renewables.  However, its best summary analysis is a dramatic reduction in demand for European gas.  Why does IBEC think the ESRI and UCC are more accurate in terms of projecting that gas will continue at current levels?  That would shoot us through any climate targets we might have.  Why does it believe UCC and the ESRI versus the wider analysis?  I can cite some other examples.  An organisation in London, E3G, has done a great deal of work for the European Union examining projected gas demand.  It recognises that a massive overcapacity in gas infrastructure networks is likely, even with existing investment plans.  I can cite numerous reports showing overinvestment in gas.  In those circumstances I question the Department's analysis that gas is good.  It is bizarre that we have a climate action Department cheering on gas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#J00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Ryan, I must apologise.  We had to be in the D&aacute;il because we were speaking on the establishment of the climate change committee, which links in nicely to what we are discussing here.  I have read the documentation the witnesses provided in advance.  Perhaps they could help us understand the size of the oil and gas industry here.  How many people are employed directly in it?<\/p> <p>  Ireland is not part of a major oil and gas exploration industry.  Would the witnesses accept that if we are to set a standard in moving towards green energy we should be making a definitive statement that we are moving away from exploration for oil and gas?  The Department and others will suggest that transitioning over a prolonged period will still require the usage of a certain amount of gas as a base energy provider.  Is it not the case that a small country such as this, which has not really been involved in the exploration sector and notwithstanding the fact that we will have to import gas for a considerable amount of time into future, should be setting a standard in moving away completely from the use of fossil fuels?  Accepting that there is a transition period and that we will have to import gas, do the witnesses accept that making such a statement will force investment in the energy sector towards green energy in this country and the delivery of electricity in a far cleaner way?<\/p> <p>  The suggestion put forward by the industry and by some in the Department is that we will continue to use oil and gas for a prolonged period in any case and, therefore, we should not cut off that supply and access to energy security.  It must be accepted that we have never had enough oil or gas for security.  What we are extracting at present does not give us long-term security.  The information available to me does not lead me to believe that we are on the cusp of a major find that will ensure our security over the period to 2050, during which period everybody accepts we will still be using gas.<\/p><p>Would we not just be better off deciding here and now that, although we will still have to use fossil fuels as an energy source to an extent, we will move away from the exploration of fossil fuels in our waters?  This would force the investment sector to look to other greener technologies where we have an abundance of resources.  I am particularly taken by the research I have looked at on the potential to invest significantly in the capture of wind off our western shore.   For sure it is at an early stage and the technology is not yet there but it will never be there while we continue to focus on what looks like a less expensive and more easily accessible energy source.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan said, fossil fuel exploration is highly speculative.  The one thing we are sure of is that there is wind and that is likely to continue.  Let us set a standard that tells the investment community the State is up for this and wants to participate in developing green technologies.<\/p><p> There will be opportunities.  As we know, Statoil has invested significantly in other jurisdictions in capturing wind.  Given that the companies get it, why does the State not send a message that it is open to this type of investment and will support companies if they talk to us and tell us what they will need to get through the first phase of the considerable risk associated with developing offshore wind technology.  Let us look to ways the State can provide the grid.  For those in the renewable sector, including those attempting to develop offshore wind, the big question is how long access to the grid will take.  The State is a big participant in the development and provision of the grid.<\/p><p> I listened to the Minister tell us what great changes we have made in terms of climate change because we were the first in the world to state all cars would be electric by 2045.  I am not part of the Government, so I could make a prediction that if I am ever a Minister we will not have certain things in 2045.  For the current Minister to make this type of commitment is meaningless.  What we need is real action that will encourage the investment sector and community to develop green technologies.  One of the best ways to signal this particular opportunity would be to say we will get out of fossil fuel exploration, and that as soon as the current crop of extraction has reached its natural life we will draw it to a close.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#J00700","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I have a couple of comments to follow up on what has already been said.  For me, the stand-out figure from Professor Sweeney's presentation is that we come 28th out of 29 countries on climate change, which is a pretty poor position to be in.  That is pretty damning and it says a lot.  To follow what Deputy Dooley said, there appears to be a view in Government that it is better to engage in damage mitigation and manage fines than take radical steps to be proactive in addressing the substantive issue.  This approach is of concern.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Offshore Operators Association mentioned that Norway has renewables and fossil fuel exploration.  I am curious because if we juxtapose this with Sweden, my understanding is that Sweden has made a fairly radical departure and will go fossil fuel free in the very near future.  Sweden has access to great fossil fuel reserves in the North Sea but it will choose not to use them.  Other members of the committee and I recently visited Denmark, a country with a long-standing tradition in renewables.  What is Norway doing differently from Sweden and why did it go down that route?  Why does it not follow its neighbours in embracing a more renewable approach?<\/p> <p>  My next question is to Dr. Slaven, who has written a book that I have not read.  I will try to read it, however, so she has made a sale today.  Dr. Slaven made a very impressive presentation.  Something I have never understood during the many years I have studied this issue, and I was an observer long before I entered the Oireachtas, is how we have had three different reviews since 1992 but royalties from fossil fuels have been zero and State participation in these activities has been zero.  There are many other metrics we might have used to get some benefit for the State from all of these activities but we have not done so.  This has not been down to one particular Government or party.  We have had three successive reviews under three different Governments.  I have never been able to fathom this.  This is going a little bit against the grain with regard to renewables and supporting the Bill, but I am curious about it.  I know we cannot interfere with contracts that are assigned, but before it is too late is there anything that could or should be done in this regard?<\/p> <p>  I must confess to Professor Sweeney that I am a little biased because he teaches at my local university in Maynooth and my wife, who was one of his geography students some years ago, speaks very highly of him.  He spoke about stranded assets, which I thought was very interesting.  That is a type of financial penalty.  Funds do not make decisions that do not have good fiscal rewards and I understand they are beginning to distance themselves from fossil fuel-type funds.  I presume this is because of the risk that they may be stranded if the return is cut off and they will not drive a yield in five, ten or 15 years' time.  I ask Professor Sweeney to elaborate on that point because it is an interesting line of argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#K00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

I did not have much knowledge of seismic testing until I started to read about it.  What it does in seeking to find the precious resources of this country is damning.  Licences and the history of oil exploration in this country, if I may be excused the pun, are a very murky business.  Communities have been superseded by vested interests.  I ask the witnesses from the Department to comment on this.<\/p> <p>  Why are the detractors of the Bill against it?  The vast majority of people here and globally know oil production and consumption are unsustainable.  The way capitalism consumes natural resources is unsustainable.  Alarm bells ring with regard to companies involved in oil exploration.

To answer Deputy Stanley's question I will have to refer to some technical experts on fossil fuel replacements for the fertiliser industry.  On the more general point he made about recognising the potential for offshore wind, wave energy and other renewable energies, what is important about the approach the Department is taking is we want to see a portfolio of technologies.<\/p><p>We would not advocate that one technology should be excluded or is a failure.  There are many emerging technologies in the renewable area which we hope would have great potential as well.  The model suggests that we will need a range of different types of energy sources and the uses of different technology to deliver on the 1.5&deg; Celsius objectives.  It is not a case of either-or or one or the other.  What we need to do is develop a mixture of options.<\/p><p> There was a query about the renewable energy sector as well.  The point made in that regard was a good one.  One thing that we are working on in terms of the renewable energy systems, RES, policy is to help diversify the range of renewable options that can be brought into the system.  It is an important point that has been raised.  We are in the process of changing the policy in that area to encourage that.<\/p><p> Reference was also made to biomass, which was identified by University College Cork, UCC, as a potential energy source.  It is interesting because UCC is the only one to have looked at the local energy system in terms of the Irish energy system in the future, going forward to 2020 and 2050, so its work is particularly informative from that perspective because it is directly applicable to Ireland whereas many of the studies apply to regions or take a global perspective.  In recent years UCC has carried out quite a bit of work in that area which is very informative for the committee.  It has included biomass in long-term, ambitious scenarios that are compliant with the Paris Agreement.  Biomass is definitely another optional energy source for the future.  What we want to ensure is that we have a portfolio mix that provides resilience for the supply of energy in Ireland going forward.<\/p><p> Deputy Eamon Ryan asked about prospectivity and whether there is any oil or gas out there.  He mentioned the Celtic Sea.  It is important to recognise that there are ongoing exploration activities taking place in the Atlantic, the Celtic Sea and the north west, in the Slyne region near where the Corrib field is.  There are a number of regions in Ireland that are considered to have prospectivity in terms of future reserves.  We cannot predict where the reserves are going to be.

I would not say that the Department cheers on gas.  We are talking about a wide range of technologies and the transition from the existing fossil fuel dominated energy system to a much more diversified system.  We are going to have increased emphasis on energy efficiency, and a much greater role for renewable energies, but within that context there will be a role for fossil fuel and there are new technologies that will be emerging in that space as well.  It is important to put that in context.  If that is the future we are looking at in 2050, where different scenarios will exist and where there is an element of fossil fuel, we should be conscious of that when we are making the decision that we are not going to look for our own reserves in that area.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that has been raised is whether we are going to encourage renewable energy investment and the ability of Ireland to make a statement in terms of our commitment to a long-term transition change and investment in renewable energies.

It would leave Ireland in the same position because it would not change our consumption of energy.  The real actions that are going to demonstrate Ireland's long-term commitment to climate change include improving our efficiency, reducing our energy demand and increasing renewable energies.<\/p> <p>  If one thinks about some of the countries that have been ranked high, I understand Denmark is in the top ten, and while it is the second largest oil producer in the European Union, it is also one of the most ambitious countries in Europe for wind energy.  It is a country that sees that a portfolio of options is the best way forward.  It is exploring and producing in its offshore region and at the same time it is making commitments to achieve more renewables.  More than 50% of its electricity is generated from renewable energy.  Similarly, Portugal was ranked second or third in that list.  It is a country that has a very high ranking but it also has an active exploration policy while at the same time making significant investment in renewable energy.

I might then address some of the technical issues as well as the question of why we feel this Bill is not appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Norway is going down the route of continuing to explore for and produce oil and gas, but Sweden is not.  This is largely down to geology.  The prospectivity in the Swedish area is not deemed to be anything like that in the Norwegian area.  That is often the case with individual countries.  Many will take a stand and go down this or that route depending on their geology or other resources.<\/p> <p>  A number of countries have been mentioned.  France produces 50% of its total energy, and 75% of its electricity, through nuclear sources.  It is relatively easy and does not do much harm to the energy system for France to say that it will not explore for any further oil and gas when its oil and gas prospectivity is not great in any event.  There is no oil and gas production in Costa Rica and there have been few, if any, exploration wells.  Some 80% of its electricity comes from hydroelectric sources and 14% comes from geothermal energy, accounting for 94% of its electricity.  It is easy for Costa Rica to say that it does not need to explore for oil or gas.  In New Zealand, 57% of electricity generation comes from hydro power while 13% comes from geothermal sources.  It is one of the world's leading countries in terms of geothermal energy and was the second country ever to produce it.  It has a significant prospectivity for the production of energy in that regard.  As such, it is relatively easy for New Zealand to say it will not explore for anything further.<\/p> <p>  In many instances, existing resources and geology are factors.  I will stick with geology, then go through prospectivity and ideas.  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked whether the Celtic Sea had been gone through with a fine-tooth comb.  My answer is \"No\" because ideas and data change.  We have new seismic data that cause us to view prospectivity in a different way.  This kind of thing has happened in many parts of the world.  For example, very little exploration took place in particular parts of the geological column of the North Sea because it was believed at the time that there could be no prospectivity there.  In fact, there is significant prospectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Pat Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>With the Chairman's indulgence, I will ask a technical question.

It is a little difficult to be certain of break-even costs, but it is probably realistic to assume that they will be in the order of $50 per barrel even in Ireland's deep offshore waters.

We have tried to show today that even if we found the 5 billion barrels or whatever Providence boasted it might get last year, it would take between 25 and 40 years to be able to use it, which brings us right up to the middle of the century at which point we are supposed to be bringing our carbon emissions right down.

That is something we are quite concerned about.  I understand that the ESRI is doing a new model at the moment to measure the impact that decarbonisation will have on the Irish economy and on individual sectors.  From our members, there is an appetite for looking at renewable technologies and moving away from fossil fuels.  We need supports from Government and that is why in our budget submission this year we made a number of recommendations which I think are being discussed in the committee room next door.  We are looking at supports for renewable heat to help companies move away from fossil fuels.  The scheme is long overdue and we would like to see funding for it increased in 2019.  For renewable electricity, we made a detailed submission last year on the renewable electricity support scheme.  We see growth in renewable electricity but ideally with Exchequer funding to support premium cost technologies.  We would also like to see supports for low emissions and electric vehicles.

I want to come back on Deputy Eamon Ryan's question about why we would view one set of forecasts as more accurate than another.  All forecasts are wrong, almost by definition.  We tend to use the word \"projections\".  We project under business as usual and then constrain it.  Depending on the assumptions we make, the model will throw up different least-cost solutions.  We can tell it we want a reduction of 8% or 95%.  We can make assumptions on the roll-out of electrification of heat, deep retrofit, transport decarbonisation through electrification or gas fuel prices and the model will come up with different answers.  Generally, they run the model numerous times and identify the no-regrets measures.  Gas-fired generation is a no-regrets measure.<\/p> <p>  There is no obvious alternative.  It is worth pointing out, though, that even if we were somehow able to achieve 100% wind power generation on the system, which would fall over on day one when the winds start blowing, it would be very difficult to get beyond 50%.  We are leading the world in going up to 70% for short periods, but to get 50% on average through the year is an extraordinary technical achievement.  Denmark is hugely interconnected to Germany so it can produce a lot more because it is relying on fossil generation, indeed, coal-fired generation, from Germany to keep the lights on when the wind stops blowing.<\/p> <p>  One of the points about renewable heat is that it is grossly underfunded.<\/p><p>In recent years, we have spent &euro;300 million to &euro;350 per annum on renewable energy sources for electricity, RES-E, but almost nothing on renewable heat or transport.  That reflects policy measures that have been in place since Deputy Eamon Ryan was Minister.  The emphasis has been on renewable electricity which, unfortunately, makes no contribution to our national target.  Our 20% target excludes the power sector and was not intended to be met through domestic effort.  The European Commission ran a model which determined the most cost-effective approach.  It then weighted that because Ireland was regarded as a rich country - it was before the collapse of the economy.  Three years later, in 2012, the Commission realised the sums were incorrect and re-ran the model to determine what each country's cost-efficient effort would be if there were no boundaries in Europe and everything was done cost-effectively in the effort-sharing sector.  For Ireland, that would imply no reduction but we had a 20% target, with the implication that we would do whatever possible in terms of cost efficiency but would then have a significant shortfall and need to buy international credits.<\/p><p> Four or five years ago, it seemed likely that we would get at least halfway to the 20% target.  However, the economy has since boomed, more cars are being driven, more houses are being built and we are consuming more energy but do not have the renewable heat and transport incentives which should have been in place ten years ago.  We have strongly advocated for a significant increase in that expenditure.  There was a very cordial exchange at the national economic dialogue in the past week or so and there is a general understanding among many NGOs, the business community and even the farming community about what needs to be done to reduce emissions.<\/p><p> On the issue raised by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, I cannot comment on the figure of 30% less emissions for European and indigenous oil and gas but, because I used to advise the Commission for Energy Regulation on natural gas, I am aware of the very big compressors in Moffat which pump gas from Scotland to Ireland.  For every 100 therms that are shipped, approximately one to 1.5 therms must be burned.  That is a small amount but the gas only needs to travel 200 miles.  Proportionately more would have to be burned if the gas was travelling a far longer distance and far more so in the case of liquified natural gas, LNG.<\/p><p> Several years ago, the Economic and Social Research Institute pointed out the catastrophic consequences of a loss in gas, as might be caused by an issue at the connection point in Moffat, and welcomed the possibility of a backup source.  In the absence of piped gas from an indigenous field as a backup, it was determined that an LNG terminal would probably be needed.  LNG has a far bigger carbon footprint because the gas which comes out of the ground must be compressed in order to liquify it, which is very energy intensive.  It must then be transported, stored and evaporated, all of which uses energy.  The laws of physics mean that the production and delivery of LNG will always be more energy intensive than that of gas delivered through a long-distance pipeline.  That is why LNG is more expensive and the reason a terminal has not been built in Ireland.  Such a terminal would probably require a subsidy but the Department or regulator may decide that is what we need.  There is a premium on having diversity or security of supply.<\/p><p> In terms of whether we are importing Russian, Norwegian or British gas, one must identify which would be the marginal producer if we were consuming one more therm of gas.  Would Norway produce the extra therm or be producing flat out or constrained by the pipe?  Britain may have untapped supplies or the gas may come from the Continent.  If the additional therm of gas came from the Continent, one must seek its origin.  In the case of a country at the end of the pipe which is consuming more because less is being produced domestically, one must ask which marginal producer will cover the shortfall.  Russia may be that producer.  I have never investigated that issue but I suspect the gas probably originates in eastern Europe or beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#N01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Neil Walker","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>It works the other way.

The two scenarios chosen by IBEC, one of which is based on the research of Dr. Alessandro Chiodi and others, are non-Paris-compliant scenarios.  However, the model is very sensitive to the input assumptions which are made.  As Dr. Walker stated, one will get different answers depending on the weapons one chooses as inputs.

I note Dr. Walker is not very keen on the 20% target for 2020 and I suspect he would not be very happy about a 44% target for 2030.

For the record, the idea of stranded assets emerged initially from a growing movement for divestment which started with Professor Bill McKibben in Vermont in 2010.  Since then, the universities have taken up the challenge, including Stanford and Georgetown.  The first UK university was Glasgow and the first Irish university was Maynooth, which has now been followed by Trinity College.<\/p> <p>  I point also to the foundations.  The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is divesting.  Given what we have heard about the investment of oil revenues in Norway, that is very significant.  Of the total divestment, 26% has come from faith-based groups.  The Church of Ireland announced a divestment policy recently while the Catholic Church is also undertaking a rigorous investigation and will probably announce a divestment policy in advance of the papal visit.  The movement is accelerating and it is being driven by young people who see the writing on the wall in terms of intergenerational equity.  They see that if we continue on the path of \"drill, baby, drill\", we will disenfranchise and disadvantage the next generation.  There is an issue of equity which we must recognise in what is proposed in the continuation of a fossil-fuel economy.

There does not seem to be a drag on companies like Statoil which has announced that it will move to more renewable energy development.  We see massive international companies announcing these plans and smaller ones are acting too.  Statoil is a semi-state company and there is an impetus for Norway to move to renewable energy.  The state faces contradictions in that it is very dependent on oil and gas production.  Nevertheless, there is a recognition that it wants to move in a more sustainable direction.<\/p> <p>  There is little impetus in Ireland for oil companies operating here to move given the largely supportive policy framework.  The Bill would change that and companies would be obliged to move to renewable energy or at least consider it more deeply.  They are not forced to do it now as there is a great deal of leniency around authorisations and there is a great deal of support from the State.  To encourage companies to move towards renewable energy development, changes in supports are needed for both companies and communities.  One of things hampering renewable energy development has been the policy framework excluding communities from decision-making.  That has exacerbated conflicts and caused communities to resist renewable energy developments.  We need to look at how we properly resource renewable energy development and how we ensure that communities are part of the decision-making.  That must be the core approach.  It will involve changes to planning legislation.  It is not enough simply to change guidelines for companies.  There must be a statutory obligation to involve communities in the process.  What is stopping companies is that they are not forced to do that in Ireland.  They are not made to move towards renewable energy and our planning process creates conflict.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lawless asked why we still do not have any royalties after three reviews of licensing terms nor do we have any State participation.  He asked if there was anything that could be done.  There is a great deal that could be done.  However, we need to go back to where this started.  In 1959, we had an authorisation which granted all rights to Irish territory, onshore and offshore, to an American oil company for &pound;500.  In 1962, a different American company went to the Norwegian state and said it wanted all rights to a particular acreage offshore.  It offered $200,000 but the Norwegian state said it would not do it because the resources belonged to its people.  Norway said that decisions around oil and gas exploitation would be made in such a way as to maximise the benefit for the state.<\/p> <p>  The issue with the Irish approach is ideological in that resources are not seen as belonging to the people, despite what the Constitution says.  Policy decisions have not reflected that provision.  We have also had a strong influence from the oil industry historically in its resistance to change.  Justin Keating's 1975 terms went against that.  He introduced royalties and State participation.  He saw oil and gas exploitation as a matter for the State for the benefit of the people.  That was successfully changed by the State in subsequent reviews.<\/p> <p>  We have a problem with the influence of the oil industry on decision-making and we have a problem with ideology which does not see resources as the property of the State.  That can be changed.  If we were to have hydrocarbon exploitation in future, we could place the licensing regime on a production-sharing footing.  Norway developed its approach on the basis of production sharing with the state placing an obligation on oil companies to carry the state's costs.  That allowed the state to develop activity offshore while maximising its benefits.  There are plenty of lessons to learn from Norway, including how to manage resources to maximise benefits for our State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amanda Slevin"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I want to address a question Deputy Gino Kenny asked.

Deputy Smith raised a broad set of issues.  She is quite correct when she says this is not just about Ireland.  Ireland's energy policy and climate policy is grounded within European Union policy.  In the context of European emissions reductions of the order of 80% to 95%, the scenarios indicate that approximately one third of primary energy within the EU will be oil and gas in 2050.  As such, a solution must be found to meet that requirement.  That is in the context of significant emissions reductions.  Europe as a whole faces energy security issues.  These issues have been discussed at ministerial level and policy has been developed.  The EU dependence on imported natural gas is almost 70%.<\/p><p>Security at a European level is important and we are part of that market.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to a seismic testing study.  The scientific view is that it is a limited study.  I believe six samples were carried out daily over two days.  It was conducted in an estuary in Australia in an area of about 30 m.  Seismic activity takes place in deeper areas in Ireland so the data are not usefully comparable.  Further research would have to be done and further academic studies carried out in that area.  It does not tell us much about the impact of seismic surveys in the area because of the different circumstances and the limited nature of that one study undertaken.  <\/p><p> All the licensed activity that happens in Ireland is subject to the application of the environmental impact assessment directive and the implementation of the birds and habitats directives.

I had the great privilege of visiting High Island of the west coast, near Clifden where they were monitoring Manx shearwater, but it is the same with the puffin population or any other sea birds.  They had to fly out hundreds of miles to their feeding grounds.  It is complex.  It may be changing because of climate or overfishing, for instance, but the ecologists and biologists who spoke to me described a crisis in the north Atlantic.<\/p><p>Those birds are a very good indicator of what is happening.  Real alarm was raised about the distances they had to fly just to get food.  <\/p><p> I want to ask technical questions around the exploration.  The issue of climate is one thing, but I want to focus on the issue of security.  I was involved for many years in the Corrib project, and was told at the time that it was an ecological fluke.  It was explained that there was a particular salt deposit that acted as a cap, that it was a constrained geological formation and that it was a relatively small field, which is why we were lucky with it.  There was one other prospective field nearby, which was drilled in 2010 or 2011.  Everyone expected that it would be the same as the first but it was completely dry.  Perhaps new discoveries have been made in the field of geology, but I believe it is much more likely that because all of the easy to reach stuff has been found we are now looking for the really hard to reach stuff.  <\/p><p> Deep water is hard to work in, especially in the north Atlantic, and the costs are higher.  If it is a massive field, perhaps providing 50 barrels, an investment might be justified.  From memory though, when I asked during the Corrib gas exploration how gas would be brought ashore if it was found further out to sea, I was told that it is quite difficult to pipe gas ashore.  Floating storage technology could be used; perhaps Professor Shannon could indicate if that is likely.  I was told at the time that there was nothing like the Corrib field anywhere nearby and that we would have to go 100 miles or more further out to start looking for other such fields.  If we found a gas field 200 miles out, in deep water, with no other existing field or pipeline, does the Professor believe that floating collection technology could be used rather than running a pipeline for 200 km?  It would serve a single field only, and does not compare to the North Sea, where one could link up to an existing massive network of infrastructure.  At a first exploration of a 100 to one shot field in the North Atlantic, for example, would the Professor think it preferable to use a mobile floating collection system instead of running a pipeline all the way to the west coast of Ireland?  Would that not make more economic sense?  If that was done, where is the security?  Why would one bring it to shore in Ireland, instead of to Norway or the Shetland Islands, wherever the gas could be treated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#Q01800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530626400,"counter":428,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  One concerned discoveries and geological thinking.  There have been major advances in geological thinking over the past decade or so.  That has been backed up by new ways of thinking about how oil and gas are generated and trapped.  New data has allowed us to see some of the sub-surface in three dimensions.  For many years companies tried to find analogues to discoveries in the North Sea.  It was mentioned earlier in the debate that in recent years people have begun to think that perhaps the real comparators are on the other side of the Atlantic, off the Jeanne D'arc and the Flemish Pass basins, where new discoveries have been made.  Our thinking has changed radically.  It is not true to say that everything has been looked for.  Evidence for that is that in the last licensing round a significant number of new, major companies came to Ireland for the first time.

Last week the IEA outlined how Europe would have a deficit of 80% of its gas needs by 2040.  In the context of meeting the obligations of the Paris Agreement, there will still be a need within Europe for gas and oil, which will carry on beyond 2050.  While the projects will come on stream before that, there will be an ongoing need for the provision of fossil fuels, both within the energy system and for feed stock.  It is important that we do not ignore what the models and scenarios are indicating to us.  When we make plans we expect to see a level of need for those energy sources.  The project timelines are consistent with that.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Ryan for his appreciation of the ObSERVE programme.  It is quite a major programme.  A number of queries were raised about the energy needs of Ireland in the future.  I do not want to speak on behalf of University College Cork, UCC, but it would probably benefit the committee to have UCC respond to some of the questions raised, in terms of whether its scenarios are compliant with the Paris Agreement.  It could address that important question.  It provides a lot of information about how we we can develop our energy system in a manner compliant with the Paris Agreement obligations, which is very informative.  It is important to remember, when we are talking about the Paris Agreement commitments, that the agreement does not seek to prohibit fossil fuels.  It has a temperature objective, and the focus is on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The aim is not to eliminate fossil fuels, but rather to eliminate the emissions of greenhouse gases that have an impact on the temperature objective.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#R01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matthew Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Dr. Slevin may have already answered this question.<\/p><p>A number of witnesses have said that banning exploration would be a threat to our energy security.

I did not make myself sufficiently clear.  If we go back to reliance on a single source, which comes through Britain, a decision may be made as a result of regulatory issues or of the Department that public support in the form of a public service obligation, PSO, levy would apply in order to make LNG viable in order to reduce the risk of a catastrophic loss of supply.  There are different economic issues.  Huge investment costs are involved in land-based terminals, which are not viable.  There is a new technology called floating storage in which a ship containing liquified gas is brought in and just parked in Cork Harbour.  They have used this in Israel for a number of years.  The investment costs are somewhat less.  It may not even be shipped ashore.  It might be brought into the harbour and be allowed sit there in case of a failure.  There are different technologies but the point is that LNG has to be produced and then compressed with huge compressors in order to liquify and refrigerate it.  It then has to be stored, perhaps for weeks and weeks.  Small amounts may escape unless it can be recompressed.  This results in methane which has a higher potential for global warming.  Finally, when it is desirable to use it, it has to be brought back up to room temperature, which also consumes energy.  It is a less environmentally friendly fuel because it starts with piped gas and then all of these things have to be done to it.  It is costlier and has a higher carbon footprint, but it is better than the lights going out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#S01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Neil Walker"},{"type":"speech","time":1530626400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>That implies that IBEC would be opposed the LNG terminal at Shannon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018070300002#S01200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530626400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>We are not opposed to any particular project.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Paul O'Neill and Ms Louise Mulcahy.<\/p> <p>  The NDFA's mandate is set out in the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.  It has two main roles.  The NDFA is the statutory financial adviser to certain State bodies as listed in the Act on all public investment projects of scale.  At present, we are providing financial advice on projects with a value in excess of &euro;5.5 billion, including public private partnership projects with a value in excess of &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p> <p>  The NDFA's mandate includes responsibility for the procurement and delivery of public private partnership projects in sectors other than transport and the local authorities.<\/p><p>Within this mandate, the NDFA&rsquo;s exposure to Carillion is confined to the schools PPP bundle 5 project, SB5.  Carillion was new to the Irish market, in contrast to its presence in the British market where Carillion was engaged in up to 450 projects at the time of its collapse.  We are not aware of Carillion having been involved in any other Irish Government infrastructure project.<\/p><p> The SB5 PPP project was announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s 2012 PPP stimulus package.  The NDFA managed and provided financial advice on the procurement of the SB5 project on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The project comprises six facilities: five replacement schools and one replacement institute of further education.  Following a competitive tendering process and financial, technical and legal due diligence, a contract was awarded to the Inspired Spaces consortium PPP Company in July 2016.  PPP Company comprises two shareholders: Carillion Private Finance and the Dutch Infrastructure Fund, DIF.  Under the contract, the construction works were subcontracted by PPP Company to Carillion Construction and the post-construction services to Carillion AMBS.  The contractual structure is set out in appendix 1 to our submitted paper.<\/p><p> Funding for the project was secured by PPP Company in the form of a 90:10 debt-equity ratio.  The bank debt financing was provided by MUFG, at 50%, and Helaba Landesbank, at 50%.<\/p><p> The PPP Company, under the direction of its shareholders, is responsible for managing the overall process, including the making of payments to the main works contractor.  Since the collapse of Carillion, DIF has taken responsibility for the management of Carillion&rsquo;s stake in the project with the oversight of the funders.  The NDFA, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in close contact with all parties.<\/p><p> Following intensive efforts by all parties in the intervening months, an announcement was made on 28 June 2018 that DIF and the project lenders were putting in place arrangements for the appointment of a replacement contractor, Woodvale, to facilitate the completion of the three most advanced schools: Loreto College, Wexford, Col&aacute;iste Raith&iacute;n, Bray, and Ravenswell primary school, Bray, by the end of August, and undertake survey and preliminary work at the other three buildings in the bundle: Tyndall College, Carlow, Carlow Institute of Further Education, and Eureka school, Kells.  This survey and preliminary work will be undertaken during the summer and will provide a detailed scope of works to enable the contract management arrangements to be finalised for the completion of these schools by the end of December.  The arrangements, which follow a retendering process, provide for a contractor to be mobilised in the coming days and for work to commence on site in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> By way of an update since I submitted this statement, I can confirm that, as of yesterday morning, in Bray there were a team of construction workers and a landscape contractor on site.  As of this morning, in respect of the Wexford school, I can confirm there are a team of contract workers there.  Both sites are now active.<\/p><p> As of today, in accordance with the PPP contract, the State has not made payments in respect of the schools&rsquo; construction other than an amount in respect of preparatory site advance works.  Payments from the State under the PPP contract are made monthly and will commence upon completion of the schools, which were at various stages of completion on the date of liquidation.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I will be happy to address questions relating to the Carillion liquidation to the extent that it has impacted NDFA-procured projects.  I am, however, limited in two respects.  I am not in a position to discuss third parties that are not counterparties of the NDFA nor am I free to discuss details of the procurement of the replacement contractor which has progressed but has yet to conclude fully.

They did hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of euro worth of work that they are unlikely to get paid for.  The State will benefit from that through the use of these schools in September, and nobody wants to prevent that.  They tell me there is no way whatsoever that an independent assessor can verify the work, the solution and the bonds.

It is not engaging and the people concerned are being left high and dry.  That is the point.  We are in a situation where the company can cherry-pick and it is doing it for some but not for others.  It is doing it for some because it is expedient and it has to do so because there is no way the NDFA's independent inspector can sign off on that type of work.  However, the others who slogged it out with their shovels and picks are being left high and dry and their companies are going to close down.  That is the reality.  Given the amount of money on the hook as we are emerging from a recession and with things picking up at a time when we need labour and so forth, it is a sin that potentially we will have companies closing down.  The companies have been in family hands for generations and built or partly built other schools in the State.  The pitches on which children will be playing, the floors on which they will walk and the classrooms in which they will be taught were constructed by them.  It is not right.<\/p> <p>  The NDFA is the authority that must sanction the quality assurance in that regard.  It is simply not the case that the NDFA has no role when it comes to the subcontractors.  It has absolutely no role in the payment of the subcontractors, but it does have a role in ensuring the work the subcontractors did was up to the appropriate standards, as laid down by law.  The way to do that is to ensure the contractor the NDFA has engaged receives the necessary certification from the subcontractors.  How it does that is up to the contractor.  We all know the way it will have to do it, which is through paying them, just as it will have to do with the subcontractors that were involved in the design.  I cannot see why the NDFA will not do that.  The only argument Mr. O'Neill has given is that they will have a claim against the Salmon Group which is in liquidation, but subcontractors that also have a claim against the Salmon Group in liquidation are involved with the new company.  They have to be owing to the design element.<\/p> <p>  Why not do it for everybody?  It would give the NDFA quality assurance.  It knows that the schools would be safe and that they would be insured, as would all of the products that were used.  It would also provide us with the right conclusion, which is that the companies that constructed the schools were all paid at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070300002#H00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530621000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>This is an industry-wide problem and if a solution is to be found, we will have to consult the industry as a whole and find a solution that would apply to all sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1530621000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>There is a serious risk that the NDFA is in breach of the law with regard to what is to happen.
