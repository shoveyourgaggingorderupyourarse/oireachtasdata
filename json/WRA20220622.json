The\u00a0Climate Planning Fund for Business\u00a0is therefore available to all Enterprise Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta clients and potential clients, with certain programmes such as the GreenStart also available through the Local Enterprise Offices, which support all\u00a0businesses with less than 10 employees.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Enterprise Emissions Reduction Investment Fund\u00a0provides grant aid to reduce the payback period on carbon reducing technologies in manufacturing processes, and is designed very specifically to achieve\u00a0a core measure in the enterprise chapter of the Climate Action Plan 2021 to &ldquo;accelerate the uptake of carbon-neutral heating in industry&rdquo;. It is therefore targeted only at manufacturing businesses, the vast majority of which are, or are eligible to be, clients of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. The Enterprise Emissions Reduction Investment Fund will provide manufacturing businesses the foundations they require to begin their transition to low carbon production processes and assist them to invest in carbon abating capital equipment and technologies.<\/p>  <p>  To help all businesses get started on the transition to a low carbon economy, my Department, with Minister Ryan's Department, launched the\u00a0Climate Toolkit 4 Business last year, which can assist all SMEs and microenterprises. The Toolkit provides an estimate of the carbon footprint of the business based on some simple information input and generates a tailored action plan and highlights relevant state programmes and funding that can assist in implementing the recommended actions. These actions will be in the areas of energy use, water use, materials use and transport. By implementing them, businesses will be well on their way to a greener future. I would encourage all enterprises that do not qualify for the Green Transition Fund to engage with the Climate Toolkit for Business as it will help them get started on their low carbon journey.<\/p>  <p>  Our Local Enterprise Offices recently re-launched the &ldquo;Green4Micro&rdquo; programme. This programme offers green transition advice and technical support to micro-enterprises. The Green for Micro programme is open to all micro-enterprises, and not just agency clients, with up to ten employees. This programme is particularly suited to businesses in construction and the built environment, retail, manufacturing, textiles and fashion, food, electronics, plastics, and packaging. Qualifying SMEs receive two days of intensive mentoring, including a sustainability audit, and design an action plan to reduce their carbon footprint. With climate change, changing regulations, rising resource costs and changing customer expectations adopting an eco-friendlier approach is the best way forward for business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200060#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200060#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[32992\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200060#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if section 137 of The Companies Act 2014 will be amended to allow for directors in Northern Ireland to establish and register a company with the Companies Registration Office without having to lodge a non-resident directors bond revenue bond; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>At the outset, I should clarify that there is no restriction under company law on residents of Northern Ireland either establishing or being directors of Irish registered companies.

In general, the Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT. Ireland currently operates two reduced rates of VAT, 13.5% and 9%, as permitted by the Directive. <\/p>  <p>  Building materials are not included in the categories of goods and services on which the EU Directive allows a lower rate of VAT or an exemption to be applied, and so they are liable to VAT at the standard rate. By way of special derogation from the general rule though, Ireland is permitted to continue its long-standing practice of applying a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks but there are strict restrictions on this derogation, including that the rate cannot be reduced below 12%.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive the supply of construction services is liable to VAT at the standard rate generally across the EU but Ireland applies a 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, again subject to strict restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  Construction services that consist of the &ldquo;renovation and repairing of private dwellings, excluding material which account for a significant part of the value of the service supplied&rdquo; can benefit from the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%. This means that where a building contractor carries out home improvements and the material cost does not exceed two-thirds of the costs of the improvements then the reduced rate of 13.5% applies to the total construction service. A consequences of this is that a VAT registered building contractor will generally be entitled to recover VAT at the standard rate on most building materials purchased while the contractor is only liable to change VAT at the 13.5% reduced rate on the total supply (including the materials and labour elements of the job) to the homeowner. The difference in rates between the 23% input VAT and the 13.5% output VAT should normally be reflected in the VAT inclusive costs to the homeowner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200061#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[33171\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200061#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will share the Department&rsquo;s fiscal contingency plan in the event multinational companies leave the Irish market on foot of the implementation of the global and or European minimum tax rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>Ireland is very supportive of the two-pillar solution for the taxation of the digital economy reached globally at the OECD, an agreement to which we signed up to along with over 130 other countries in October 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My long-standing position is that the international tax system needs to adapt to keep pace with changes in how business is conducted internationally. This is a global issue which requires global action to solve in a coordinated way. The OECD agreement will ultimately bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework based on a shared understanding of where value is created in digital business models. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been very active in recent years in implementing international tax reforms. I published Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap (2018 and 2021 update) to set out our commitments made and the significant, concrete actions we have taken in response. My Department facilitates extensive engagement with stakeholders in advance of new legislative measures being introduced and this collaborative, transparent process provides certainty to businesses situated here and those considering investing.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, Ireland is still a small open economy and certain risks exist in relation to corporation tax. In relation to concentration risk, the latest data show that around &euro;1 in every &euro;8 of overall tax revenues collected arises from just 10 large corporate tax payers.\u00a0 This concentration means total tax receipts are vulnerable to the business decisions of a handful of large companies, albeit that many of those have had a significant presence in Ireland for decades. While the strong growth in corporation tax over the last several years is, in many respects, welcome and a reflection of the success of our industrial policy in attracting high quality multinational firms and high wage jobs to Ireland, we must be careful not to craft long-term budgetary policies on the basis of these volatile and unpredictable corporate tax receipts.\u00a0 As a result, the Government has frequently cautioned against building permanent expenditure commitments on the basis of corporation tax receipts.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Proposed changes to the international tax regime from the OECD agreement also represent a risk to the CT revenue stream. My Department&rsquo;s central estimate at present is that c.&euro;2 billion could be lost in corporate tax by 2025 relative to baseline. I would stress that there is significant uncertainty attached to this technical assumption; the final figure could be considerably different. However it is my view that the benefits of current OECD and EU tax reforms outweigh the negatives. The reforms achieve a fine balance that will provide the certainty and stability required by businesses here for future economic growth and employment creation. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The government has taken actions to address the risks associated with the concentration and volatility of CT receipts, including prioritising the reduction of debt and continuing to broaden the tax base.  Finally, last year I established the\u00a0Commission on Taxation and Welfare\u00a0to analyse the structure of our public finances and to propose reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of our tax and welfare systems.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management manages fire service issues in my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Fire services in Ireland are provided by the local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide deliver local authority fire services, 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms\/ standards established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.  The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, 'Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach, which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires that occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.  <\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;Retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association.  <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options that will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.  <\/p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group.  <\/p>  <p>  That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including Local Government, fire service management\/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. It is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management before the end of the year.  At that time, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management will make a determination on the publication of the report. <\/p>  <p>  Following the delivery of the Retained Fire services review report, any recommendations made to National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management&rsquo;s Board, to address the issues raised in relation to the recruitment and retention of Retained Firefighters, will need to be considered with stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  In regards to retained fire stations that were unable to deploy appliances or crews on foot of an emergency call due to manning levels. Detailed data on the interruption of service at individual stations, whether due to staffing, unavailability of appliances, crew engagement in training or for other reasons, is not collected by, and consequently is not available in, my Department. The relevant information may be available from individual local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  The Fire Service operate a pre-determined attendance model, enabling very high levels of resilience within the Fire Service. This enabled full service delivery throughout the Covid-19 public health emergency, with next nearest stations being deployed immediately in any situation where a station was unavailable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200063#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":182,"content":"<p>Question No. 63 answered with Question No. 62.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":183,"content":"<p>Question No. 64 answered with Question No. 62.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200063#WRD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[33145\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200063#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the actions taken by his Department on foot of formal complaints regarding alleged planning irregularities in County Wicklow; if any engagement has taken place between his Department and Wicklow County Council, the garda&iacute; or the Office of the Planning Regulator on the allegations; if he will commit to carrying out an investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>My Department has received correspondence relating to a number of allegations regarding certain matters in County Wicklow.

over the past two years.<\/p><p>The Passport Service continues to outperform its previous busiest year, 2019, by over 20%. Over 623,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022. This is 105,000 more passports than were issued at this point of the year in 2019. In the past four weeks, the Passport Service has issued an average of 30,000 passports per week.<\/p><p>99% of all child and adult online renewal applications are issued within the standard turnaround time and almost half of all adults who renew their passports online will receive their new passport in the post within 2 working days.<\/p><p>Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In the space of three months, processing time for first-time applications has been reduced by almost 40%.<\/p><p>My Department has been proactively planning for this significant increase in demand for many months and have made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.<\/p><p>A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway since 2021. In addition, the Passport Service has run its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs).  The Department has also been working with the HSE to provide opportunities to contact tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. As of 20 June, these staff have begun to be assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which will further increase the number of staff answering customer queries. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the Passport Service to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the Passport Service in June of last year.<\/p><p>Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p><p>Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified. This new system assists in reducing the number of applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.<\/p><p>I am satisfied overall that Passport Service operations are meeting the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements are allowing the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined below in tabular form, for online applications.

First time registrations and renewals for customers outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network. The allocation of appointments with GNIB is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, nine temporary extension of immigration and international protection permissions were provided to 31 May 2022. These extensions were available to all persons required to register and allowed them the opportunity to renew their registration, either online with my Department if residing in Dublin, or nationally with their local immigration office. <\/p>  <p>  Permissions were extended on the same terms and conditions as the permission already held. Any non-EEA national whose Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card had expired was allowed to rely on each of the published notices on my Department's website to prove their immigration permission was renewed in line with them.<\/p>  <p>  These extensions were made in the context of an uncertain health and international travel situation to provide assistance and assurance to people who use our immigration services.<\/p>  <p>  Now that those circumstances are returning to normal, it is important that we also return to a more normal way of doing business. This includes in relation to first-time registrations and renewals, and processes and procedures are in place to allow customers to do so.<\/p>  <p>  At present, there are no plans to introduce a helpline as suggested by the Deputy. However, there is already a Helpdesk system in place where Dublin based customers experiencing difficulties or who have urgent requirements can email my Department at immigrationsupport@justice.ie. This is staffed by the Registration Office customer service team,  who are available to support and process their requests. <\/p>  <p>  Customers residing elsewhere should contact their local Garda Immigration office for supports and advice.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a number of measures in order to support all applicants through the registration process with detailed guidance notes and videos, in several languages, available on my Department's immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie).<\/p>  <p>  Since July 2020, Dublin based customers who are seeking to renew their permission and receive a new IRP card can do so fully online at: inisonline.jahs.ie\/user\/login. Since its introduction, more than 138,000 renewal applications have been completed.  Customers can now apply up to 12 weeks in advance of their current permission&rsquo;s expiration date and I have significantly increased staff capacity to process the applications on hand due to high demand. <\/p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 741 741) was introduced for customers. The current operating hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and all appointments for Dublin based customers to register their immigration permission for the first time are now issued through this service. Operators offer one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group.<\/p>  <p>  To date the service has provided 27,428 appointments with a further 7,499 appointments booked to early August and applications are currently being processed on a seven days a week basis.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and in particular staff of our frontline immigration services are doing all that we can to continue to provide a quality service to our customers during this period of unprecedented demand.  The situation will continue to be monitored, in the weeks and months ahead in order to maintain and further improve on service delivery to our customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200068#WRJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":428,"content":"<p>Question No. 158 answered with Question No. 157.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200068#WRJ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[33036\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200068#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1348 of June 14 2022, when she expects the appropriate mechanism to facilitate cooperation to be in place; if she will that ensure victims and their families are informed of progress beforehand directly by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>The Deputy refers to Operation Denton, which is  an ongoing UK independent analytical review into the activities of what was known as the Glenanne Gang in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Operation Denton forms part of the work of the Kenova Investigation Team with regard to a series of Northern Ireland legacy cases.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to cooperating to the greatest extent possible with Kenova and already has in place a High Level Agreement which supports mutual co-operation and exchange of information with the Operation Kenova Investigation Team in the context of criminal investigations.

The Department of Health, in conjunction with its partners, is committed to supporting and facilitating these wishes and preferences in the years ahead. A clear demonstration of this is in the investment of &euro;195 million, allocated in Budget 2022, to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme as well as the continuation of the &euro;150m allocation made in 2021, which is delivering an unprecedented expansion of home support provision. The Department of Health and the HSE also support a number of complementary Support-Coordination models which will help our older citizens to age in place and reduce the rate of older people transferring to long-term residential care.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is also committed to delivering the vision of the 2019 policy statement on 'Housing Options for Our Ageing Population', jointly published with the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage. The central aim of the policy statement is to increase the housing options available to older people and to facilitate the integration of supports in a more coherent way, particularly between the housing and health sectors, with a view to facilitating people to live at home with dignity and independence for longer.   <\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland&rsquo; also commits to expanding the housing options available for older persons and sets out specific actions on housing for older people, including a commitment to implementing the 40 actions that were contained in the Housing Options for Our Ageing Population policy statement. A successful housing outcome for older people requires an effective blending of housing and health policy and the cooperation of a range of stakeholders in order to plan productively for the delivery of services to meet the needs of older people.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Housing has advised my Department that it provides housing supports for older people through capital funding provided directly to local authorities for the provision of older persons specific housing. In addition, by way of the Capital Assistance Scheme and the Capital Advance Leasing Facility, the Department of Housing has advised that it provides funding to Approved Housing Bodies who provide housing for older persons. In the case of the housing for older people provided directly by local authorities the rent paid is a &lsquo;differential rent&rsquo; based on the income of the older person.   <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health, alongside the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is currently supporting a housing with supports &lsquo;demonstrator project&rsquo; in Inchicore in Dublin. Housing with support is defined as purpose-built, noninstitutional accommodation, where older people have their own front door and where support or care services are available. This is a collaborative, cross-sectoral, and cross-departmental project that recognises the need for a joined-up approach to addressing the critical issue of creating housing choice for our ageing population.  <\/p>  <p>  This project will deliver 52 homes and is intended to set a new standard for the future of housing provision for older people and to act as an exemplar for others to follow. The &lsquo;Housing with Support&rsquo; model brings together a range of services and supports &ndash; principally relating to housing, community, social and care needs. It will enable older persons to live full lives in their own homes within their own community with independence and reduces the need to move into long term residential care. The total CAS funding approved for the project is &euro;22m (subject to conditions) as well as a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the Department of Health towards additional communal facilities.  The HSE will provide revenue funding for the provision of supports for the tenants when they are in situ. The project has received Stage 4 approval recently and Dublin City Council expect that it will be commencing on site by mid-year year 2022 with a 2024 completion date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[32914\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average length of time from application that it takes for a professional (details supplied) with qualifications from abroad to register with CORU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":476,"content":"<p>CORU is Ireland's multi-profession health regulator, being responsible for regulating certain health and social care professions. CORU&rsquo;s role is to protect the public by regulating the health and social care professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended). This role includes setting the standards that health and social care professionals must meet to be eligible for registration and maintaining registers of persons who meet those standards. <\/p><p>There are two forms of application to CORU: applications for the recognition of qualifications received outside the State and applications for registration. Professional qualifications awarded outside the State are assessed through a process of &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; which involves expert assessment of a qualification&rsquo;s alignment with the standards of proficiency required in Ireland, and assessment of professional experience and lifelong learning where required.  Where a health and social care professional qualifies outside the State and applies to register in Ireland, they must apply for the recognition of their qualification. EU\/EEA applicants have the right to have their qualifications assessed in accordance with the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and Directive 2005\/36\/EC on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications and the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2017 (SI No 8 of 2017).

Following our discussion, several measures have been initiated by CORU aimed at further reducing timeframes. <\/p><p>Until last year applicants were required to complete the recognition process before initiating the registration process unless they had confirmed job offers. All applicants are now invited to initiate an application for registration as soon as they have submitted a complete application file to the recognition department.

Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. <\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. <\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK03500"},{"type":"question","counter":496,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[33028\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the case of a child (details supplied) will be examined and an effective care plan expedited.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[33029\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062200069#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to recruit additional neurology nurse specialists for a hospital (details supplied);

It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<\/p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<\/p><p>2.

The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.<\/p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided in 2022 to support this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Both current and capital funding totalling &euro;17.43 million has been approved for this initiative. The plan will result in an additional 67 spinal fusions and 28 spinal other procedures for children with Scoliosis, as well as an additional 141 procedures for children with Spina Bifida. The plan also allocates substantial paediatric orthopaedic procedures at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital, with 720 additional procedures planned for the year.<\/p>  <p>  By using the capacity provided by Cappagh for less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites. The impact of the plan has already been recorded with increased activity year to date. Year to date by the end of May 2022, 197 scoliosis procedures had been carried out, compared to 156 for the same period in 2019.

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie\/eng\/staff\/resources\/hr-circulars\/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html <\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE\/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision.

It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<\/p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<\/p>  <p>  2.
