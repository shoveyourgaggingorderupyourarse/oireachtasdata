I am also fully confident that my Department and the enterprise agencies under my remit are doing everything they can to capitalise on any opportunities that Brexit presents.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 a further additional &euro;3m in pay funding was provided to the enterprise agencies to support recruitment and assist in their response to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  That additional &euro;3 million will support the recruitment of 40-50 staff across the Department and its Agencies to meet the Brexit challenge.  This brings the number of new Brexit related staff posts to around 100 in the last two years and demonstrates the Department&rsquo;s determination to ensure that it, together with its Offices and Agencies, are sufficiently resourced to meet the Brexit challenge.<\/p>  <p>  As per its Brexit-strategy, IDA Ireland has continued to engage with its clients - supported by a targeted marketing campaign - to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s advantages in a post-Brexit context.  The reasons why companies invest in Ireland are well-known: the availability of talent, the ease of doing business, a competitive and transparent taxation regime, positive demographics, a common law system and, critically, Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to EU markets.  This approach has worked well as IDA Ireland has secured a substantial number of Brexit-related investments in 2017 and 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s mid-year results for 2018 clearly indicate that we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland so attractive in the first place.  In fact, the Agency has indicated that in excess of 40 companies across the Financial Services, Life Sciences, Technology and Engineering sectors have chosen Ireland as a result of Brexit.  I can state with certainty that as Brexit negotiations intensify in the time ahead, IDA Ireland will be continuing its efforts to attract mobile investment by highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s suitability as a location for international business and by constantly engaging with clients across its entire portfolio. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of Brexit.  In 2018, the agency has reorganised its European footprint, with the United Kingdom now being treated as a separate territory from the rest of Europe and continental European business being managed from the Frankfurt office. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also provides a range of supports that exist to help companies plan for both the opportunities and risks that Brexit poses.  While the outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain, Enterprise Ireland is actively supporting Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit and to take the necessary steps to ensure they are more innovative, competitive and market diversified to tackle the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 also contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; including the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme which will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  It will be open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500 people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000065#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Disputes","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000065#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[30631\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000065#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on an industrial dispute (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>I understand that the dispute at the company referred to by the deputy relates to certain terms and conditions of employment, including that of pay and contractual security which the trade union Mandate is seeking to negotiate on behalf of its members.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I must emphasise that Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For its part, the State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms i.e. the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.\u00a0 This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This particular dispute was\u00a0the subject of a Labour Court recommendation last April\u00a0which urged the parties to engage with each other in order to seek agreement in relation to the matters at issue. \u00a0Furthermore, the Court recommended that if, following such engagement, matters remained unresolved, the parties should avail of the services of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Court in furthering efforts to secure resolution.  In line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland, recommendations of the Labour Court made under industrial relations legislation are not binding on the parties.<\/p>  <p>  I understand it is\u00a0the company's position that it\u00a0does not recognise trade unions but has in place an internal mechanism for employee engagement.  Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise\u00a0trade unions.  However, successive Governments have\u00a0committed to\u00a0the concept of collective bargaining and to this end,\u00a0legislation was introduced\u00a0in 2015 in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 to strengthen the ability of workers to collectively engage with employers. <\/p>  <p>  The 2015 legislation\u00a0allows\u00a0for application to be made to\u00a0the Labour Court to\u00a0examine the issue of\u00a0independence of internal employee engagement mechanisms\u00a0in instances where it is contested\u00a0that such mechanism is\u00a0not genuinely\u00a0independent of the employer. \u00a0If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent\u00a0it can\u00a0then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the need for workers and employers to\u00a0make every effort to reach a resolution\u00a0in this dispute which presents a significant inconvenience for\u00a0members of the public. The dispute handling mechanisms of the State are of course\u00a0willing, where possible,\u00a0to assist\u00a0the parties in coming to a\u00a0resolution.

Research undertaken by Enterprise Ireland in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates, and it developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which Enterprise Ireland supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.\u00a0 The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012, and since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.<\/p>  <p>  The demand is there.

This commitment was reiterated in Innovation 2020 in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on Innovation, Research &amp;amp; Development consists of both public and private expenditure. Gross investment in R&amp;D\u00a0was &euro;3.2 billion in 2016.  This is an increase of over half a billion euro since 2011.  The estimated expenditure on R&amp;D by Government Departments in 2017 is &euro;768 million.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;40 million over 2016 and is the highest level of public expenditure on R&amp;D since 2012.<\/p>  <p>  A very significant part of our innovation policy has been to align public investment efforts in a manner that leverages R&amp;D activity in the enterprise sectors.  While private spending on R&amp;D slowed during the financial crisis, it has been increasing steadily since 2011.  Business Expenditure on RandD rose to &euro;2.3 billion in 2016 from &euro;1.7 billion in 2011, an increase of over 35%.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the fact that overall expenditure in R&amp;D has increased every year since committing to Europe 2020 targets, reaching the 2.5% of GNP intensity rate target presents a very\u00a0significant challenge.  In 2016 our GNP intensity level stood at 1.43%, down from 1.91% in 2012.  Even when using GNI* as a complementary indicator (GNI* removes globalisation impacts on the Irish economy), the R&amp;D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This is in part due to the strength of our economic performance and subsequent increases in GNP growth rates year on year over the last number of years.  Our challenge is to increase the level of investment in R&amp;D to keep pace with GNP growth rates, in the context of significant demands on the public purse.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of the R&amp;D intensity rate, I am pleased to note that Ireland performs well in international comparison tables.

Suffice to say that, as it stands, there is no clarity on what approach will be taken.<\/p>  <p>  It is therefore not possible to determine the impact on employment.\u00a0 it\u00a0is likely that any changes to how digital businesses are taxed will impact Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax receipts as the changes would likely see greater taxing rights in larger countries.  The Summer Economic Statement published sets out that the Government will be prudent in its approach in 'setting aside some of the historically high levels of Corporation Tax for the purpose of creating the Rainy Day Fund'.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of the final outcome, it must be borne in mind that Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.\u00a0 Crucially, our regime is underpinned by substance.

The first one, a Digital Services Tax (DST), proposes a &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; solution of a 3% levy on turnover from certain digital service activities.  The thresholds for application is for a global turnover of &euro;750m and EU turnover of at least &euro;50m.  The second, \"comprehensive solution\", requires an overhaul of international taxation, establishing the concept of a \"digital permanent establishment\", allowing countries taxing rights over the digital business carried out by a company in that country, even where the company has no physical presence in the country.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, the OECD had released their interim Report on the Digital Economy, which acknowledges the lack of consensus in the area and that further analysis is required in order to achieve an agreed evidence backed solution focussed on the alignment of taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission proposals are now being debated and it would seem that there is now a widespread acceptance among Member States that the value of these EU discussions is primarily to give impetus to the OECD debate.  This is illustrated by the recently issued joint statement from the Finance Ministers of Sweden, Denmark and Finland calling for the EU to abandon plans for a digital tax based on turnover and to support reform of digital taxation at OECD.<\/p>  <p>  While a number of Member States remain committed to the interim proposal of a Digital Services Tax on turnover, it should be recalled that the OECD&rsquo;s Task Force on the Digital Economy found that there is no consensus on the merit or need for such short-term measures which it is widely acknowledged can be economically damaging. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seeker Employment","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[30460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the role her Department has played in providing opportunities for asylum seekers to work here; if the information available to her, her Department and the agencies under her remit has contributed to decisions on the way in which asylum seekers can access employment and help to fill skills gaps; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>Policy responsibility for asylum seekers rests with\u00a0my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Minister Flanagan.<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court judgement in NVH v MJE of 30 May 2017 declared that an absolute ban on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to Article 40.1 of the Constitution.\u00a0 Under section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act 2015, an applicant was prohibited from accessing or seeking to access the labour market while their application is being determined.

The IDA\u00a0shares this objective and\u00a0I am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that its results for 2017 show that 45% all jobs created last year were for locations outside Dublin.  Every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year and there are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies outside of Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  Employment numbers\u00a0for 2018 will not be available until\u00a0my Department's\u00a0Annual\u00a0Employment Survey is carried out in November 2018. \u00a0In the last year IDA client companies\u00a0conducted two site visits to County Cavan and one site visit to County Monaghan.  Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0want to stress that\u00a0IDA Ireland\u00a0is working hard to promote Counties Cavan and Monaghan to potential investors.  The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East\/North West Region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre.\u00a0 As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area, it is focusing on sectors including agrifood, manufacturing, tourism, internationally traded services and cleantech.  The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.\u00a0 IDA Ireland also owns lands in both Cavan and Monaghan that are being\u00a0actively marketed to\u00a0its clients.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that foreign direct investment\u00a0only forms one part of investment in regional locations.  Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.\u00a0 My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across this country. <\/p>  <p>  The success of this Government's strategy for regional job creation is reflected in Combilift's new &euro;50 million Research and Development and Testing Centre in County Monaghan.  This new investment will create 200 jobs and is an example of a home-grown Monaghan success story.  The positive impact that Combilift has on the county, the border region and Ireland cannot be underestimated. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Enterprise Ireland supported companies\u00a0employed 10,817 people\u00a0in Cavan and Monaghan in 2017.\u00a0 Companies supported by the LEOs in Cavan and Monaghan employ a total of 2304 people, representing a net increase of 239 over the previous year.  I think that these numbers clearly reflect the growing domestic industries which are so important to both counties.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We recognise that there is room for improvement in\u00a0Cavan and Monaghan\u00a0and we are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the region.  The Enterprise Agencies\u00a0under my remit will\u00a0continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Relations","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[30986\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the contingency planning which has been undertaken in respect of the recent actions of the US Administration in seeking to undermine WTO rules and imposing tariffs on EU imports; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>The Irish Government, along with the rest of the EU Member States, is deeply disappointed with the current direction of US trade policy.  We &ndash; all 28 EU Member States and the EU Commission &ndash; are clear that these tariffs are not justifiable on national security grounds.  We fully subscribe to the EU position that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission, which leads on Trade Policy for the Member States under the Treaties, and working in full consultation with the Member States, has\u00a0prepared a measured, proportionate, and WTO-compatible response, which Ireland has\u00a0fully\u00a0supported.  These measures include the launching of proceedings by the EU against the US at the WTO, the introduction of rebalancing tariff measures by the EU\u00a0and the possible\u00a0imposition of provisional safeguard measures comprising import quotas or tariffs to shield EU producers from a sudden influx of steel or aluminium into the EU market which would ordinarily have been destined for the US market.<\/p>  <p>  EU leaders have also endorsed a positive agenda for dialogue on trade issues with the US, once the steel and aluminium tariffs against the EU are lifted.  Ireland is of the view that the EU should not negotiate under threat, and that any talks must be preceded by a permanent exemption.  The EU and its Member States are also working with other like-minded countries &ndash; such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico &ndash; to develop an agreed approach to issues of concern.  We continue, of course, to keep open the lines of communication with the US Administration and other key &lsquo;influencers&rsquo;.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The US has sought to use the threat of tariffs as leverage to obtain trade concessions from the EU.  The EU&rsquo;s united approach that we are willing and able to respond when necessary in the face of such unilateral non-WTO-compliant actions is vital.  We believe the US Administration is resolute on these issues at this time and, therefore, we believe the EU must remain as resolute and stay united.  The alternative is to accept such action in breach of WTO rules as the EU understands them.  Over the past number of months, the EU has engaged with the US at all possible levels, and with other partners, to find a solution to the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.  Indeed, I met with Secretary Ross in Washington to discuss these and related matters in May.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, we continue to monitor potential impacts of the trade measures being taken by the US, as well as those being contemplated.  We remain alive to the fact that while certain actions may have limited impact at macro level, this could possibly mask individual firm level impacts.  To this end, my Department and its agencies are keeping the situation under review.  Indeed, I convened a meeting of my Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges last week to discuss our strategy and hear, first hand, from a variety of representative bodies, their issues and concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[30537\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he met the Mayor of New York when he visited the city.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[30076\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to New York on 1 July 2018; the persons who travelled with him; and the meetings he attended.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[30692\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent trip to the United States of America and the meetings he had there.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 112 and 120 together.<\/p><p>I travelled to New York on Sunday 1 July to take part in a series of events marking the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s election campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term. <\/p><p>I was joined at a number of these events by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, Minister of State Kehoe, Minister of State Cannon, and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Mark Mellett.  <\/p><p>I was accompanied by a small delegation from my Department which included my Chief of Staff, an Assistant Secretary General, the Assistant Government Press Secretary, my Private Secretary, and a Security Officer from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p>Since joining the UN in 1955, Ireland has made a sustained contribution to the international community&rsquo;s efforts to tackle important global challenges like peace and security, human rights, international development, climate change and sustainable development.<\/p><p>We have always sought to be an active and fair member of the international community and we have a responsibility to actively engage with the UN. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for the UN Security Council will deepen our UN engagement.

A short-list is drawn up based on the specific criteria set out by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience.  However, the final decision rests with the inviting body, usually the OSCE or the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The recent call for Election Observers to participate in the upcoming EU EOM to Zimbabwe attracted a high volume of applications with a total of twenty four Short-Term and eight Long-Term Observer applications.

The area is inhabited by members of the Jahalin tribe, which was expelled from its home in the Negev to the West Bank in the 1950s.  One village in particular, that of Khan Al Ahmar, home to some 181 Palestinian Bedouin, 95% of whom are Palestinian refugees, has been under threat of demolition for many years.<\/p>  <p>  The communities are located in a particularly sensitive part of Area C in the West Bank, an area which is critical for the viability of a future Palestinian state.  Any attempt to develop the land for illegal settlements is therefore a threat to the Two State solution.  There is no doubt that the removal of the Bedouin community to another site, to which they have not agreed, is illegal under international law.<\/p>  <p>  These plans have been subject to a number of legal proceedings.  Many in the international community, including Ireland, have raised our concerns on numerous occasions with the Israeli authorities.  As a result of international pressure and legal actions plans for the demolition had been delayed. However, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in May 2018, the Israeli authorities were given permission by that court to proceed with the demolition.<\/p>  <p>  The UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process has said that the proposed demolition in Khan Al Ahmar is contrary to international law and has called on Israel to halt the demolitions.<\/p>  <p>  I have made two public statements in relation to Khan al Ahmar specifically, on 31 May and most recently on 4 July, calling on the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.  I also condemned the demolitions and the forced evictions of the neighbouring Palestinian community of Abu Nuwar.  The Irish Representative in Ramallah has visited Khan al Ahmar on a number of occasions, along with other European Missions, as a show of support for the villagers.  Ireland has also pressed strongly for EU action on this, and the EU has issued statements in Brussels and at local level calling on the Israeli authorities to reverse the decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Following Palestinian petitions last Thursday, the Israeli High Court has issued a temporary restraining order freezing the demolition of Khan Al Ahmar.  The Court has ordered the Israeli authorities to respond to the Palestinian claims by 11 July before making a decision whether to accept or reject the petition. <\/p>  <p>  I again call upon the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.

Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including 1.5 million people trapped in hard-to-reach and besieged areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &quot;starve or surrender&quot; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. <\/p><p>I am particularly concerned by the recent escalation of violence in the south west, including air strikes by the regime and its allies, which forced over 300,000 civilians from their homes and destroyed critical infrastructure including several health facilities.  I am aware of the report to which Deputy Shortall refers which highlights some of the shocking attacks that have taken place in Daraa province in recent weeks.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I take this opportunity to call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the respect of the de-escalation agreement and full humanitarian access to all Syrians in need.<\/p><p>I have frequently called on all regional actors, and all those involved in the Syria conflict, to show restraint and avoid any escalation, which could further undermine regional stability, as well as adding to the suffering of civilians.  I have also called on all parties with influence on the Syrian regime to exert that influence to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. <\/p><p>It is clear that Russia's support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people.  Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians.  Ireland's has communicated its concerns directly to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions.  In October 2017, I met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov.  I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s condemnation of the ongoing attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the use of chemical weapons.  I called on Russia to ensure civilians are protected, and to exert its influence on other parties to the conflict to do the same.  These messages have also been relayed to the Russian Ambassador on numerous occasions at Ministerial and official level.<\/p><p>I am aware of the issue related to property rights to which Deputy Shortall refers.  Ireland recently co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council that &quot;deplores the existence and application of national legislation, in particular 'Syrian Law Number 10\/2018', which would have a significant detrimental impact on freedom of movement and the right of Syrians displaced by the conflict to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it, and calls for their repeal&quot;.<\/p><p>Ireland and the EU believe that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict.  The human suffering caused by the Syrian conflict can only be brought to an end by reaching a sustainable political solution.  Ireland and the EU fully support UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in his efforts to lead political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.<\/p><p>Ireland and the EU also provide political and financial support to a broad range of measures which aim to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the UN Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN.  Last month, Ireland co-sponsored the decision adopted by the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention introducing an attribution mechanism to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria and elsewhere.<i><\/i>In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures.<\/p><p>The EU and its Member States constitute the largest single donor to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis and have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.6 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.  The EU hosted two international donors&rsquo; conferences for Syria in April 2017 and April 2018 at which pledges totalling over &euro;9 billion were made.<\/p><p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million in humanitarian assistance to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, making this Ireland&rsquo;s largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years.  In 2017 alone, Ireland provided almost &euro;25.5 million to the humanitarian response.  At the 2018 Brussels Donor conference, Ireland pledged to contribute a further &euro;25 million in 2018 and almost &euro;22 million of this has been disbursed so far.  Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Election Monitoring Missions","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02100"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[30793\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if all members of election monitoring panels are informed of the make-up of each election monitoring delegation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>International election monitoring missions play an important role in the promotion of democracy and human rights.

Conditions are likely to deteriorate over the coming months as the monsoon season progresses.<\/p>  <p>  This exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts by the international community to address this crisis have focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis, promoting a political solution and pressing for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred.<\/p>  <p>  While efforts aimed at achieving accountability and a political solution to the crisis are vitally important, there is an immediate need for a coherent humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh.  To this end, Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1 million allocated for 2018. Our support has focused on food, shelter, water and sanitation.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response facility, we have provided 37 tonnes of hygiene, sanitation and shelter kits and deployed experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination on the ground.  In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland's estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.<\/p>  <p>  In Northern Rakhine, Ireland provided funding to the Red Cross at the end of 2017 to provide cash transfers to 10,000 households and food and non-food items to 20,000 households; first health and assisted childbirth services; access to sanitation for 5,000 households; and reunification of separated families in Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  Elsewhere in Myanmar, over the course of 2017-18, Ireland is providing over &euro;3.5 million to humanitarian and development NGOs, primarily to Tr&oacute;caire for its work on gender equality, resource rights and humanitarian assistance to conflict affected communities.<\/p>  <p>  Humanitarian access in Northern Rakhine has been extremely limited since the start of this crisis.  Only the Red Cross Movement and to a lesser extent the World Food Programme have access.  As a result it has not been possible to provide adequate lifesaving assistance to the estimated 100,000-150,000 Rohingya that remain in Rakhine, or to other affected persons in that region.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has strongly and consistently pressed for humanitarian access to Myanmar and has added its voice to that of the international community in pushing for this crucial first step in addressing the humanitarian crisis.  I repeat that call here and for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.  The report of the Commission urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full and unimpeded humanitarian access &ndash; for both national and international staff &ndash; at all times and to all communities in Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  An intensive political response by the international community continues to be pursued and on 6 June, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been agreed between the Myanmar government, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the UN Development Programme, to establish a framework for cooperation between the parties aimed at creating conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of these refugees from Bangladesh to their places of origin.  The MoU also aims to help create improved and resilient livelihoods for all communities living in Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively engage with our international partners in supporting these efforts through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses including at the recent 38th Session of the Human Rights Council.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position including in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Council Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February last.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, support the mandates of the Fact Finding Mission and Special Rapporteur and provide for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for these acts.  Targeted sanctions have since been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassies in Thailand and in Hanoi who are closely monitoring the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Security Council","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[30812\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of staff who have been designated to work on Ireland's bid for a seat at the UN Security Council; if staff have been seconded from other Departments or outside agencies to work on the bid; if so, the number seconded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[30813\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the budget allocated for Ireland's bid to win a seat on the UN Security Council; the breakdown of the budget allocated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[30814\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if other events have been planned for Ireland's bid to win a seat on the UN Security Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[30848\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the cost of Ireland's campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council; the reason the campaign has not focused on Ireland's history and policy of neutrality in international affairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 to 156, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is seeking election to a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.

One secondment is currently envisaged to assist with the implementation of the Global Ireland initiative and this will include support to the Security Council campaign among other tasks.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to Dublin based staff, Ireland&rsquo;s Mission to the UN in New York is also fully engaged on the election effort.  I would also stress that the campaign is a whole of Department, and whole of Government, undertaking.  Thus messaging and activities relevant to Ireland&rsquo;s candidature are being integrated into the work of all sections and offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as that of other Government departments.<\/p>  <p>  Up to this point Ireland&rsquo;s UN Security Council campaign has been managed within existing resources by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As we move forward there will be a need for additional resources to promote Ireland&rsquo;s candidature as we seek to secure support from UN Member States.<\/p>  <p>  Over the coming two years until the election in June 2020, Ireland will seek to build awareness of our achievements and experience globally.  This will be realised through the use of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network, engagement on substantive policy issues at the UN, and the organisation of events on a range of themes which will highlight Ireland&rsquo;s track record globally and our principled commitment to the value of multilateralism.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality goes hand in hand with our promotion of international peace and security, including our obligations as members of the United Nations.  This aspect of our history and track record as a UN Member State is one which has resonated across the membership of the UN since we joined in 1955 and we continue to highlight it.  The themes of empathy, partnership and independence are intended to capture Ireland&rsquo;s lived experience and outlook, giving primacy to cooperation, agreement and reasonable compromise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":238,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, answered with Question No. 148.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[30887\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will request Jordan and Israel to urgently provide safe haven to civilians fleeing military attack; his views on the creation of UN managed humanitarian corridors to facilitate the evacuation of civilians; if unilateral funding will be provided immediately for the creation of camps for potentially 750,000 persons fleeing the attacks; and if he will request that adequate EU funding is provided for same in the longer term.","asker":"1222","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>I am deeply concerned about the recent upsurge in violence in south-western Syria, which has led to the displacement of over 300,000 people.  This is a further deterioration of the terrible situation inside Syria, where over 13 million people require humanitarian assistance.  An additional 5.6 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. Ireland recognises that countries in the region have more than played their part.  Jordan as an example, is the second-largest refugee hosting country in the world when compared to the size of its population.<\/p>  <p>  The safety and protection of civilians inside Syria is an utmost priority and I call on all parties to respect their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I reiterate my call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and respect for the de-escalation agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Crucially, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access must be facilitated. UN agencies and partners are providing support to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to respond to the urgent needs of the displaced.  This includes health, water and sanitation, food, shelter and other core relief items as well as ensuring the protection of civilians. In addition, UN convoys, in cooperation with the Government of Jordan, have in recent days transported assistance for the tens of thousands of Syrians near the Jordanian border.  These efforts must be sustained and increased.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million towards the Syria crisis since 2012.  Our humanitarian assistance responds to those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in neighbouring countries.  During a recent visit to a refugee camp in Jordan, where I witnessed first-hand the impact of Ireland's humanitarian assistance, I announced a further &euro;1.25 million in funding for the valuable work of UNICEF and UNHCR.<\/p>  <p>  At the recent meeting of EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Development on June 25th I discussed with my EU counterparts the issue of Syrian refugees from south-western Syria and possible solutions.  Last April, the EU hosted the Brussels II Conference for Syria and the Region, which included a focus on sustaining and increasing humanitarian assistance to all those affected by the crisis in Syria, including Syrian refugees and vulnerable communities in neighbouring countries.  The EU and its Member States contributed &euro;4.8 billion out of the total &euro;6.2 billion pledged until 2020, to support both immediate assistance and longer term response.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for sustained European response to this crisis.  Ultimately, only a political solution to the conflict will end the suffering of the Syrian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":243,"content":"<p>Question No. 161 answered with Question No. 148.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH00300"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[31549\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of public sector jobs offered as internal competitions or restricted to existing civil service or public service staff in his Department in 2017 and to date in 2018;

Prior to 1 July 2013, collection of the original &euro;100 HHC was the responsibility of the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on behalf of the Local Authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  With regards to the Local Property Tax, the Government decided that a liability to the LPT should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions.  As a matter of Government policy, and in order to keep the rate of the tax low, the Government agreed that reliefs should be targeted at owner occupiers where there is inability to pay the tax.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or qualifying cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not, \"as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date\" exceed these thresholds in that year.  <\/p>  <p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons\/civil partners\/cohabitants.  The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting.  The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT are available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances.  The LPT can be paid by way of phased payments rather than in a single payment; it can also be paid by direct debit; or through payment service providers such as An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0have initiated a review of the LPT which is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments.  It includes an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax.  It is expected that the review will be completed at the end of August and that the review report will provide a number of policy choices for consideration.  The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.  It also included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[30100\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has identified laws which are dependent on or in place as a consequence of Article 41.2 of the Constitution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1310","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is probably aware of,\u00a0a constitutional referendum\u00a0has been proposed to amend or repeal Article 41.2 of the Constitution.

The Commission was set up as an independent body with its own vote and Accounting Officer and is a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant additional resources have\u00a0been applied to the TAC since its inception with the staffing levels more than doubling over its first two years of operation.  Where additional resources have been sought to date, my Department have engaged with each request received.  Indeed the budget for the TAC has almost quadrupled between 2014 and 2018 despite the fact that in 2016 and 2017 the TAC did not spend its full budget allocation.  <\/p>  <p>  The following information relates to staffing requests received from the TAC.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2016 the TAC proposed the re-engagement of two former Commissioners on a temporary basis.  This was followed in July 2016 by a request to recruit two additional temporary clerical staff.  The re-engagement of the former Commissioners was not considered to be in keeping with the mandate of openness and transparency, so in July 2016 sanction was instead given for the appointment of 5 temporary Appeal Commissioners, to be appointed by a competitive process, and 2 full-time clerical staff.  <\/p>  <p>  An amended request was received from the TAC in August 2016\u00a0for 4 clerical staff (to include the 2 clerical staff sanctioned in July), and this was sanctioned in August 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In February 2017, following the return to D\/Finance of an experienced Principal Officer on secondment to assist with the set-up of the TAC, the TAC requested the secondment of another experienced Principal Officer from my Department.  The position was filled by the appointment of a Principal Officer on secondment from the Department of Finance in May 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In August 2017 a request was made by the TAC for 2 additional tax qualified staff at Assistant Principal level to act as case managers and this request was sanctioned.  In parallel to commencing the recruitment process via the Public Appointments Service (PAS) the TAC requested that my Department consider filling some of these positions by sending further staff to the TAC on secondment.  This was not possible as my Department has a limited number of staff with the requisite qualifications\/skills and experience and is also dealing with staffing challenges caused by an annual turnover rate of over 23% (including resignations, retirements and staff that have moved to other Departments through promotions etc.).  My officials offered assistance with the process of recruitment via PAS, including the provision of interview board members if required.  The assistance of my Department's HR manager to provide advice and guidance has also been offered to the TAC, but the TAC to date have not availed of this offer.  <\/p>  <p>  The TAC's 2018 Estimates were submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in September 2017, noting that the required additional staffing from January 2018 would be 2 Assistant Principal case managers (the 2 case managers requested in August for which recruitment had commenced), 1 Assistant Principal, 1 Higher Executive Officer and 1 temporary Clerical Officer.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0This request was sanctioned, and my Department facilitated the transfer of an experienced Higher Executive Officer on secondment to the TAC in October 2017.  I understand that the 2 Assistant Principal case managers were appointed in January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2018, the Accounting Officer of the Commission submitted a request to my Department for significant additional\u00a0resources\u00a0to meet the increased caseload of the Commission, including an additional 10 administrative staff.  The addition of these resources\u00a0would involve an effective doubling of the Commission&rsquo;s budget for 2018 from &euro;1.626 million to an estimated &euro;3.226 million which includes extra resources for ICT and new office space.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Due to the substantial increase in public resources now being sought by the TAC,\u00a0my officials requested further information to support the resource request to ensure that the proposed balance of administrative staff and the existing Commissioners would be effective in addressing\u00a0that workload.  The TAC informed\u00a0my Department in early March of this year that it had commenced commissioning a review of its resources and operations.  I am awaiting receipt of this report and, in the meantime, I have commissioned an\u00a0independent reviewer with significant experience of civil service bodies and operations to assess the current position and advise how best to address the TAC's resource needs.  This review has been expedited in order that resourcing decisions, based on a sound business case for the resolution of the current backlog, can be made as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[30865\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to have a bilateral meeting with his Canadian counterpart, Mr. Bill Morneau; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>I have no bilateral meeting currently scheduled with Minister Morneau.

of the remaining 49 deadlines, 40 have been met.\u00a0 Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in parallel with those from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.\u00a0 It is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations from both Reports cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive motor insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  I believe however that it is important to acknowledge that the average cost of motor insurance has been consistently falling since the middle of 2016, with the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicating that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.\u00a0 While it is accepted that premiums are still at a very high level for many people, such statistics indicate at the very least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis.\u00a0 I believe that the endeavours of the Working Group have contributed to this positive trend in pricing, as well as putting in motion much needed reform in other related areas, such as data transparency, the interaction between insurance companies and consumers, and the personal injuries claims environment.\u00a0 While there is still much work to be done, I consider that the Cost of Insurance Working Group project has already proven to be a worthwhile and fruitful exercise overall.\u00a0 In addition, I am of the view that its work must continue to be a priority for Government and would urge all relevant Departments to continue prioritising the implementation of the recommendations of the Reports.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would recommend drivers who are seeking or renewing insurance to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website, which has a highly informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.\u00a0 One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000071#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000071#WRJ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[31547\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000071#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of public sector jobs offered as internal competitions or restricted to existing Civil Service or public service staff in his Department in 2017 and to date in 2018;

This amendment will give the Minister the power to compel a school to open a special class or classes where the National Council for Special Education has identified a need for such provision within an area.<\/p><p>These proposed measures would further enhance the ability of my Department and the NCSE to plan for special class provision and to address issues in provision that may arise from time in time at local levels.<\/p><p>Guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes are available to download from <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[30330\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an agreement to develop a project (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>A\u00a0copy of a business case in relation to the project referred to by the Deputy has been received and is being\u00a0considered by my Department.<\/p><p>Funding for such centres in the Education and\u00a0Training Board sector\u00a0is approved on the basis that they are self-financing and that their financial activities would be separate from the overall ETB finances.<\/p><p>My Department is considering the\u00a0business case received and any implications that might arise from it and will engage with the body concerned in relation to same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[30346\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of extending the medical card waiver to all students eligible for concessionary school transport.","asker":"1266","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Currently over 116,000 children, including\u00a0over 12,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.

This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.).

The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers and cleaners) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.

This pilot project was funded by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).<\/p>  <p>  According to TII, an analysis of driver behaviour carried out in October 2015 confirmed that 58% of drivers using the Dublin Port Tunnel exceeded the 80 km\/h speed limit, and 20% exceeded this limit by more than 10 km\/h. <\/p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the average speed camera system at the Dublin Port Tunnel, the percentage of drivers exceeding the limit by more than 10 km\/h has fallen to 0.15%. This suggests that the system has had a significant effect on driver behaviour. TII also emphasises that this reduction in excessive speed is particularly notable, occurring, as it does, against the backdrop of increasing weekday traffic volumes, with Monday-Friday traffic volumes rising by 40% over the past five years.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of this system, speed checks at the Dublin Port Tunnel were conducted using handheld laser-based technology, and required a Garda presence to identify and intercept speeding vehicles. For safety reasons, these checks could only be conducted outside the tunnel and, therefore, could not influence driver behaviour inside the tunnel itself. <\/p>  <p>  The average speed camera system allows the enforcement of the speed limit within the tunnel itself, with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) used to identify vehicles that have exceeded the speed limit and the relevant fixed charge notices (FCNs) are issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without the vehicle being intercepted.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that TII has recommended the extension of the average speed camera project for an additional four years and has committed to continuing its funding and operation of the system during the extension period.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of speed enforcement on other roads, I would remind the Deputy that this is accomplished by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the use of both intercept and non-intercept methods, with safety cameras being used in specific locations, known as speed enforcement zones, around the country in order to provide non-intercept detection of speeding vehicles. <\/p>  <p>  The overall impact of the safety cameras can be seen in the impact on the fatal collisions in the designated speed enforcement zones. The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones. In 2015, this figure had reduced to 16% (or 24 road deaths) in safety camera zones.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the deployment of Garda resources is, of course, a matter for the Garda Commissioner, and I, Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in such operational matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000077#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000077#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[30031\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000077#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is a cut-off point for a person who has had a deportation order for a number of years (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the information requested by the Deputy is\u00a0as set out below.<\/p><p>The statutory criteria which must be considered in relation to a decision to make a deportation order under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 include national security and public policy, the character and conduct of the person concerned and the common good.

The reasons for this are genuine.  It is a complex Bill, both in drafting terms and on the substance.

That administrative reform requires significant updating and is not yet ready to proceed.

It will also extend the legal aid provisions, introduced for certain inquests in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, to a family member of the deceased at an inquest into a maternal death. <\/p>  <p>  This will ensure clarity for responsible persons, including hospital authorities, and will support the development of transparent and accountable oversight for checking and investigating certain types of death.

More broadly, the Bill will also update and strengthen the legal powers available to coroners regarding reporting, post-mortem and inquest of unnatural deaths; and including more robust powers to compel attendance by witnesses and the production of documents at inquest.  The Bill will also allow a wider scope for inquests, from investigating the immediate cause of death to establishing the circumstances in which the death occurred. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The public importance of effective and transparent independent investigation in such cases is obvious.

However,\u00a0I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to take all forms of anti-social and drug-related behaviour very seriously. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities, particularly in the summer months and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.<\/p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in\u00a0Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.<\/p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society. For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which\u00a0inter alia supports\u00a0Garda\u00a0activity to tackle these types of problems.<\/p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are\u00a0raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.\u00a0To this end, the House will be aware that 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting recently. The new recruits are visible proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 including 15,000 Garda members. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Provision","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR02600"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[30860\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if additional funding will be provided to purchase additional Garda vehicles between July 2018 and year end; if so, the number of vehicles that will be purchased; when those vehicles will be brought into the fleet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.\u00a0This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.

There are also 558 Garda Reserves and more than 2,300 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.

They are also matters on which I can assure the Deputy both my Department and the Authority are in ongoing discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  As had been reflected in my Written Reply to Question No. 404 of 13 July 2017, the Authority has been supported in this endeavour by an advance of &euro;1 million during each of the years 2016 and 2017 from my Department's Vote and a similar allocation of &euro;1 million has been made for the current year. These advances are being made, as provided under section 32 of the 2015 Act, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the purposes of expenditure by the Authority in the performance of its functions. As also reflected in that Written Reply and since set out in more detail in the Authority's published Annual Report for 2017, the Authority spent its first year completing a series of statutory and time-bound reports and public consultations while also establishing a start-up office and recruiting its first full-time Chief Executive who was appointed in November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the 2015 Act, a number of legal and technical issues have arisen in relation to the practical application of the funding framework that the Act provides. These provisions were intended, from a policy perspective, to provide the means whereby the Authority, having been funded for an initial and short start-up period on a recoupable basis, could then become self-funding in the longer term. This would be achieved by means of a levy based on actual expenditure by the Authority in the immediately preceding financial year and raised from those legal practitioners being regulated in the terms currently set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act. The fact that the effective roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions will require substantially more time than initially considered and that the levy also needs time to generate actual income have revealed a potential gap in the original model of recoupability that now needs to be reconsidered and resolved. This is made more complex because the levy is also intrinsically linked, in its application, to a number of other measures including the current work of the Authority in setting-up the Roll of Practising Barristers in support of which I recently commenced the necessary provisions of Part 9 of the 2015 Act. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, therefore, acknowledged the Authority's position, which it has reflected in its risk register, that the levy provisions as drafted in the 2015 Act may not, in their practical implementation and in the transpiring circumstances of the start-up, provide an adequate source of funding to the Authority and may not similarly provide for the recoupability of advances as may originally have been foreseen. My Department has also been informed by the Authority that it has engaged a financial consultant to examine the current levy provisions and to provide an expert economic\/financial opinion on them. This is expected to be provided soon and will be given early and detailed consideration by my Department and the Authority in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are, as I have said, aware of the issues concerned. Both my Department and the Authority are committed, on that basis, to the prompt and robust analysis and examination of the funding provisions within the 2015 Act to ensure that there is a sustainable levy-based framework under which the Authority is sufficiently funded going forward to fulfil its broad remit as a new regulatory body. We also wish to ensure that there is no setback to the progress it has made to date and to the important programme of reform it has undertaken under its Strategic Plan for 2018-2020. Along with the relevant officials of my Department I will, therefore, be giving detailed consideration to any necessary measures proposed including legislative amendments or refinements, if any, that may be considered appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":753,"content":"<p>Question No. 341 answered with Question No. 332.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Statelessness Determination Process","counter":754,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06700"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[31046\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of individual applications for recognition of statelessness that have been received.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[31047\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of individual applications for recognition of statelessness that were granted in each of the years 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":757,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[31048\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR07000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the average time to make a determination on an application for the recognition of statelessness.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":758,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 to 344, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Statelessness results from the complex interaction of many legal and other factors.

This analysis can include the identification of any reasons for shortages or barriers to participation in particular sectors. Its follow up work involves engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, Higher Education Authority, SOLAS and other relevant bodies to produce an agreed action plan to address the skills needs identified. <\/p>  <p>  Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or skills implications relevant to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, trade related skill sets in the context of Brexit and digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the new national skills architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills, which, together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and information on employment permit trends, provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates the prioritisation of investment in identified skills needs, and enhancing the responses by education and training providers to provision and delivery of those needs.<\/p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and the SLMRU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit. This Unit has the responsibility for the employment permits system which is managed by the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and the Ineligible Categories List. The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill skills shortages. The objective is balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is a genuine one. The rationale underpinning the inclusion or omission from the occupation lists is informed by EGFSN, the SLMRU and is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions. This process is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is operating efficiently. <\/p>  <p>  The analysis of the Expert Group on Future Skills has been reflected in the overarching strategies for the education and training system published in recent years.

EI&rsquo;s Strategy 2017-20 &ldquo;Build Scale-Expand Reach&rdquo; looks to increase the reach of its client company exports, with two-thirds of exports going beyond the UK.\u00a0 To broaden the export footprint across the globe, the EI Strategy focuses on training and supports to enhance management capability, leadership and productivity, marketing\/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D, access to funding to help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Sustaining and growing jobs and diversifying the export base is a challenge when aligned with the key objective of reducing the overall dependence on the UK market as a percentage of overall exports.

This will drive export growth to international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK. <\/p>  <p>  There is now a major focus on directing resources and expertise to the Eurozone markets where EI sees opportunities, targeting a 50% increase in exports by 2020. A new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; communications campaign is targeting Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.<\/p>  <p>  There are also significant opportunities in various other international markets for quality Irish goods and services. The future relative importance and forecasted growth rates of China, India, the South-East Asian countries, the Gulf States, Latin America and Africa combined with the scale of these markets means we will support Irish companies to continue to work to build exports in these markets. In January of this year, EI launched its new Market Discovery Fund to help more Irish companies accelerate their market diversification efforts. <\/p>  <p>  EI is undertaking 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of EI clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets. The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, reflecting the serious challenge that Brexit poses for Irish businesses.<\/p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs.\u00a0 I will continue to work with my Department and EI to ensure Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agrifood, will continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically. <\/p>  <p>  Innovation remains at the forefront of any business to ensure that they grow and expand to ensure they are at a level to compete on the EU and global markets effectively.\u00a0 Innovation involves helping companies improve competitiveness by developing new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.\u00a0 Innovation is an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in overseas markets.\u00a0 EI has a suite of supports available to assist client companies innovate and develop their enterprise.\u00a0 These supports help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable export growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland","counter":803,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS04800"},{"type":"question","counter":804,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[30997\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS04900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which business expansion can rely on innovation as a means of improving efficiency and competitiveness in the global marketplace; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[31006\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS05000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which innovation remains an integral part of Ireland's campaign to maximise its industrial impact in terms of effective trading, efficiency and modernisation with particular reference to competing on EU and world markets; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 and 367 together.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland drives innovation in Irish industry by developing in-company capabilities and by leveraging all external assets, such as the higher education system, the investor community, the Foreign Direct Investment Multinational base and international funding\/expertise to support company innovations.  <\/p>  <p>  Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) are essential components in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in global markets. Supporting research and innovation will therefore continue to remain an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to maximise impact in EU and global markets.

At the same time Enterprise Ireland has supports in place to help companies maximise the funding they can receive from the European Union through programmes such as Horizon 2020.  These supports all help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is forcing Irish companies employ RDI in a bid to protect their current exports in the UK and to explore different markets and innovation will continue to play a central role in this regard.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s annual business results survey shows that companies that invest in innovation are higher performing in terms of employment, export sales and are more sustainable through recessionary and other economic shocks such as Brexit.  It is essential that Irish companies produce products and services that are more novel than their competitors, better performing, more efficiently delivered, and cost effective for their customers.   <\/p>  <p>  There are a wide range of Enterprise Ireland RD&amp;I Programmes available to companies and they all contribute hugely to company development, growth and expansion, some of which are outlined below: <\/p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I<\/p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I supports the development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes which will have a competitive advantage in their target market. The Agile Innovation Fund launched in Quarter 4 2017 now facilitates fast track approval of such awards. <\/p>  <p>  Commercialisation Fund <\/p>  <p>  The Commercialisation Fund is aimed at improving the competitiveness of Irish industry through both the creation of technology-based companies and through the development of licenses.  It is available for projects that address a gap or need in the market by developing innovations that will ideally be ready for licensing to Irish industry or may form the basis of a new start-within 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  Innovation Vouchers <\/p>  <p>  The Innovation Voucher initiative provides vouchers worth &euro;5,000 to small businesses to introduce them to research, development and innovation, linking them with a network of knowledge providers, North and South of the border.  <\/p>  <p>  Innovation Partnerships <\/p>  <p>  The Innovation Partnership programme helps industry to engage in collaborative research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology to develop new products and services.<\/p>  <p>  Technology Gateways <\/p>  <p>  The Technology Gateway Programme provides Business Development resources to the Institutes of Technology to help them interact with industry on a local, regional and national basis.<\/p>  <p>  Technology Centres<\/p>  <p>  Technology Centres are organised to respond rapidly to industry defined needs and conduct market-relevant R&amp;D in partnership with collaborating groups of companies.<\/p>  <p>  Campus Incubators <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland funding has supported the development of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities. Incubators now exist on every university and Institute of Technology Campus in the country. Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology intensive start-ups. They are also an important driver of regional development with the majority of companies remaining in their region after they have completed their incubation period.  <\/p>  <p>  EU Funding<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to lead the Horizon 2020 National Support Network in order to secure as much Irish engagement with this funding programme as possible.  This assistance available from the European Union for new enterprises, is the instrument which supports collaborative R&amp;D in Europe and provides an important source of non-exchequer funding for companies. Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation, exports and sales.<\/p>  <p>The Horizon 2020 SME Instrument   is available and is specifically for single or groups of highly innovative SMEs with international ambitions, determined to turn strong, innovative business ideas into winners on the market.  The instrument provides full-cycle business innovation support from the stage of business idea conception and planning over business plan execution and demonstration to commercialisation. <\/p>  <p>The research and innovation supports provided by Enterprise Ireland and other agencies of my Department will be complemented by the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund  .  This new Fund is specifically targeted at game-changing innovations that will have a significant impact on the ability of companies in Ireland to compete in global markets. Expressions of Interest are now invited from consortia wishing to apply for funding under this new Fund. The type of projects that will receive funding will be:<\/p>  <p>  - Collaborative enterprise-driven partnerships that will develop, deploy and commercialise disruptive technologies to transform business;<\/p>  <p>  - Impactful projects focused on &ldquo;industrial research&rdquo; and seeking at least &euro;1 million in funding over 3 years and involving enterprises and research partners;<\/p>  <p>  - Projects with at least one SME partner &ndash; this is an essential requirement in every consortium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":808,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 360 to 362, inclusive, answered with Question No. 358.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":809,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":810,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[31002\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which enterprise led by women continues to be supported and promoted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":811,"content":"<p>Female founders have traditionally been under-represented in start-ups, and that is why my Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives aimed at supporting women to start and scale businesses that provide quality jobs throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is committed to supporting cohorts of ambitious, capable founders, and placing them on faster growth trajectories.  Research undertaken by EI in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates and developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which EI supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.\u00a0 The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012.  Since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these targeted Funds is to accelerate the growth of female founded start-up companies that have the potential to employ more than 10 people and achieve &euro;1 million in export sales within three years.  This is achieved by putting a &euro;50,000 equity investment in the company.  The Funds are designed to enable companies to reach key commercial and technical milestones, which will ensure the delivery of their product or service to an international audience. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.  EI received over 100 funding applications for this Fund and the final selection for funding is currently taking place.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, 46 per cent of all companies who received CSF investment from Enterprise Ireland were female founded.<\/p>  <p>  Another key Enterprise Ireland initiative is the Going for Growth programme.  Currently in its 10th cycle, the initiative supports female entrepreneurs who have been trading for at least two years and are strongly focussed on growth.  For zero fee, participants are offered a unique learning environment with a peer-led approach based on the shared experiences of both the Lead Entrepreneur and the other participants facing similar challenges.  Feedback shows that participants&rsquo; businesses experienced a growth in sales over the 9th cycle of over &euro;20million and employment rose by 17.5%.<\/p>  <p>  Every year EI holds a Fuelling Ambition Roadshow, which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs (existing and new) nationally by showcasing thriving Irish female entrepreneurs.  A total of 7 roadshow events were held in 2018, attended by c600 female entrepreneurs, across the country during March, April and May in Waterford, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Killarney, Monaghan and Roscommon.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  Last year we saw the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day rolled out on a regional basis.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) Programme, run by the LEOS, has also been strongly supportive of female entrepreneurs.  Since it began in 2014 over 1430 applicants (over 37% of total applicants) have been female.<\/p>  <p>  We are making progress.  The number of female founded start-ups supported by EI has increased from 12 in 2011 to 67 in 2017.\u00a0 This includes a significant increase in the proportion of female founded High Potential Start-ups supported by EI which accounted for 28% of EI HPSUs in 2017 compared to 7% in 2011.  In addition, 61% of participants attending LEO training programmes in 2017 were female while 46% of the LEO mentoring participants were female. <\/p>  <p>  I feel confident that with continued support we will continue to see increases in female led businesses in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[31003\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which the appropriate authorities at EU level continue to offer support by way of innovation, technology or other expertise in anticipation of Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>Horizon 2020 is the current EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.

The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I recently brought a Memorandum to Government for proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet agenda on 8 May last.  I intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussion at Cabinet, in due course.<\/p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on the specific proposals under consideration, I can confirm that the proposals seek to ensure that:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT03900"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[30883\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the basis upon which public sector recruitment may be restricted to existing staff, including the basis for the common recruitment competition pools operated by the HSE; and his plans to amend legislation to prevent the use of such pools.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":845,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04200"},{"type":"question","counter":846,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[30949\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when and the way in which an organisation (details supplied) decided not to provide therapies in a school in view of the fact it received funding to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":847,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

2026&rsquo; was published in January 2016.  In addition to population needs, international trends and the findings of a public consultation process, the development of the Strategy was informed by previous reports and experiences of our maternity services, both positive and negative. Indeed, the development of the Strategy delivered on a recommendation from the report, Investigation into the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway, and as reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavar.  Consequently, many recommendations made in past reports are addressed in the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised - are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  It recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.  <\/p>  <p>  The phased implementation of the Strategy is being led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, which has been established in the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care.  One of the Programme's objectives is to ensure, where relevant, that learning from individual sites is disseminated to all maternity hospitals\/units nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  Additional development funding of &euro;4.15 million is being allocated to maternity services this year.  The Programme has prioritised improving quality and safety, establishing community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans.  Such initiatives represent essential building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service and will continue to deliver tangible benefits for the 80,000 families who access maternity care each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000083#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":908,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000083#WRV01000"},{"type":"question","counter":909,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[30066\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000083#WRV01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if general practitioner cards will be extended to all carers in receipt of the respite care support grant.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":910,"content":"<p>In December 2017, the Government  announced that additional funding would be provided to enable all carers in receipt of Carer's Allowance to qualify for a GP visit card.

Majority of those with the disease are seen in the two centres of expertise - Our Lady's Children Hospital in Crumlin and St. James's Hospital. To ensure an early diagnosis and prevent early deaths, the team at Crumlin, over many years, organised a neo-natal screening in the majority of maternity hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  Sickle cell disease, among many other rare diseases, is addressed as part of the generic policy framework in the National Rare disease plan which was published in 2014.  The scope of the plan is broad given that there are 8,000 rare diseases approximately affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare.<\/p>  <p>  One of the achievements of the Rare Disease Plan was to encourage designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients. Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patient' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations in the national plan related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process. It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June 2016 during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs and two were approved.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings. It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries. This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. At the EU level, the Joint Research Centre is developing a joint European Platform on Rare Disease Registration which will promote EU level standards for data collection and contribute to the development of rare disease registries across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister I consider meeting any organisation that requests to do so.

It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. The new scheme will also be designed to support family\/unpaid carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social-care services such as long-term residential care (including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme), primary and community services and hospital services. <\/p>  <p>  As an initial step in the development of the new scheme, the Department of Health commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home-care systems in place in four European countries. The review, which was published last April, will help to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s new home-care scheme and system of regulation is informed by international experience. In addition a public consultation on the financing and regulation of home-care was undertaken last year. The purpose of this consultation, to which approximately 2,600 submissions were received, was to enable the Department to find out about the views of service-users, their families and healthcare workers on current and future home-care provision. A report on the findings of the consultation was published on 26   June and will inform the development of the new scheme. Further consultation with service-users will take place later this year, in addition to which the Department is actively engaging with the key NGOs and representative groups. <\/p>  <p>  The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-care services is a complex undertaking. While the publication of the HRB review and of the report on the findings of the public consultation represent important milestones in the process of developing the new scheme, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of the home-care scheme and system of regulation. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. The Department will continue to prioritise its work in developing the new scheme and every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible. However a realistic timeframe for the establishment of the new scheme on a statutory basis is 2&ndash;3 years.<\/p>  <p>  While the new home-care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive are continuing efforts to improve existing home-care services. In 2018 the HSE brought the funding for home help and Home Care Packages together into a single home support service for older people. As well as simplifying the application-process for home-care, the new service will be more responsive to service-users' changing needs. More broadly the HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and to build appropriate care-pathways, in particular for people with complex needs. A consumer-directed approach to home-support provision will be introduced, giving service-users greater choice in relation to when they receive services and their selection of a service-provider. This enhancement of current service-provision is being supported by increased investment in home-care services.

Pending the completion of this work, there may be a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.<\/p><p>  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26th June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications.

The programme includes a number of facilities in Donegal. Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Furthermore, the National Development Plan, published earlier this year as part of the Ireland 2040 policy initiative, acknowledges the need for additional capacity requirements and it is expected that 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds will be required across the public system in Community Nursing Units and other step-down facilities, as identified by the Health Capacity Review.<\/p>  <p>  Under the NDP, health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue -  including the Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units.  These major priority projects and programmes will require the bulk of the notified capital allocation over the initial period of the Plan, 2018-2022.  It is important to recognise that the NDP is a long-term plan, which will roll out over ten years and includes provision for a large number of developments across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Mental Health and Older People Jim Daly TD is aware of local concerns that have been raised relating to the future of long-stay residential care provision in the East Donegal area.

This provides clear guidelines and procedures for staff to follow both in cases of suspected abuse and of neglect of vulnerable adults (including older people).
