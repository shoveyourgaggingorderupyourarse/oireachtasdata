I am also fully confident that my Department and the enterprise agencies under my remit are doing everything they can to capitalise on any opportunities that Brexit presents.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 a further additional &euro;3m in pay funding was provided to the enterprise agencies to support recruitment and assist in their response to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  That additional &euro;3 million will support the recruitment of 40-50 staff across the Department and its Agencies to meet the Brexit challenge.  This brings the number of new Brexit related staff posts to around 100 in the last two years and demonstrates the Department&rsquo;s determination to ensure that it, together with its Offices and Agencies, are sufficiently resourced to meet the Brexit challenge.<\/p>  <p>  As per its Brexit-strategy, IDA Ireland has continued to engage with its clients - supported by a targeted marketing campaign - to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s advantages in a post-Brexit context.  The reasons why companies invest in Ireland are well-known: the availability of talent, the ease of doing business, a competitive and transparent taxation regime, positive demographics, a common law system and, critically, Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to EU markets.  This approach has worked well as IDA Ireland has secured a substantial number of Brexit-related investments in 2017 and 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s mid-year results for 2018 clearly indicate that we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland so attractive in the first place.  In fact, the Agency has indicated that in excess of 40 companies across the Financial Services, Life Sciences, Technology and Engineering sectors have chosen Ireland as a result of Brexit.  I can state with certainty that as Brexit negotiations intensify in the time ahead, IDA Ireland will be continuing its efforts to attract mobile investment by highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s suitability as a location for international business and by constantly engaging with clients across its entire portfolio. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of Brexit.  In 2018, the agency has reorganised its European footprint, with the United Kingdom now being treated as a separate territory from the rest of Europe and continental European business being managed from the Frankfurt office. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also provides a range of supports that exist to help companies plan for both the opportunities and risks that Brexit poses.  While the outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain, Enterprise Ireland is actively supporting Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit and to take the necessary steps to ensure they are more innovative, competitive and market diversified to tackle the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 also contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; including the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme which will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  It will be open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500 people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000065#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Disputes","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000065#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[30631\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000065#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on an industrial dispute (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>I understand that the dispute at the company referred to by the deputy relates to certain terms and conditions of employment, including that of pay and contractual security which the trade union Mandate is seeking to negotiate on behalf of its members.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I must emphasise that Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For its part, the State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms i.e. the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.\u00a0 This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This particular dispute was\u00a0the subject of a Labour Court recommendation last April\u00a0which urged the parties to engage with each other in order to seek agreement in relation to the matters at issue. \u00a0Furthermore, the Court recommended that if, following such engagement, matters remained unresolved, the parties should avail of the services of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Court in furthering efforts to secure resolution.  In line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland, recommendations of the Labour Court made under industrial relations legislation are not binding on the parties.<\/p>  <p>  I understand it is\u00a0the company's position that it\u00a0does not recognise trade unions but has in place an internal mechanism for employee engagement.  Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise\u00a0trade unions.  However, successive Governments have\u00a0committed to\u00a0the concept of collective bargaining and to this end,\u00a0legislation was introduced\u00a0in 2015 in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 to strengthen the ability of workers to collectively engage with employers. <\/p>  <p>  The 2015 legislation\u00a0allows\u00a0for application to be made to\u00a0the Labour Court to\u00a0examine the issue of\u00a0independence of internal employee engagement mechanisms\u00a0in instances where it is contested\u00a0that such mechanism is\u00a0not genuinely\u00a0independent of the employer. \u00a0If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent\u00a0it can\u00a0then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the need for workers and employers to\u00a0make every effort to reach a resolution\u00a0in this dispute which presents a significant inconvenience for\u00a0members of the public. The dispute handling mechanisms of the State are of course\u00a0willing, where possible,\u00a0to assist\u00a0the parties in coming to a\u00a0resolution.

Research undertaken by Enterprise Ireland in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates, and it developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which Enterprise Ireland supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.\u00a0 The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012, and since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.<\/p>  <p>  The demand is there.

This commitment was reiterated in Innovation 2020 in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on Innovation, Research &amp;amp; Development consists of both public and private expenditure. Gross investment in R&amp;D\u00a0was &euro;3.2 billion in 2016.  This is an increase of over half a billion euro since 2011.  The estimated expenditure on R&amp;D by Government Departments in 2017 is &euro;768 million.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;40 million over 2016 and is the highest level of public expenditure on R&amp;D since 2012.<\/p>  <p>  A very significant part of our innovation policy has been to align public investment efforts in a manner that leverages R&amp;D activity in the enterprise sectors.  While private spending on R&amp;D slowed during the financial crisis, it has been increasing steadily since 2011.  Business Expenditure on RandD rose to &euro;2.3 billion in 2016 from &euro;1.7 billion in 2011, an increase of over 35%.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the fact that overall expenditure in R&amp;D has increased every year since committing to Europe 2020 targets, reaching the 2.5% of GNP intensity rate target presents a very\u00a0significant challenge.  In 2016 our GNP intensity level stood at 1.43%, down from 1.91% in 2012.  Even when using GNI* as a complementary indicator (GNI* removes globalisation impacts on the Irish economy), the R&amp;D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This is in part due to the strength of our economic performance and subsequent increases in GNP growth rates year on year over the last number of years.  Our challenge is to increase the level of investment in R&amp;D to keep pace with GNP growth rates, in the context of significant demands on the public purse.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of the R&amp;D intensity rate, I am pleased to note that Ireland performs well in international comparison tables.

Suffice to say that, as it stands, there is no clarity on what approach will be taken.<\/p>  <p>  It is therefore not possible to determine the impact on employment.\u00a0 it\u00a0is likely that any changes to how digital businesses are taxed will impact Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax receipts as the changes would likely see greater taxing rights in larger countries.  The Summer Economic Statement published sets out that the Government will be prudent in its approach in 'setting aside some of the historically high levels of Corporation Tax for the purpose of creating the Rainy Day Fund'.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of the final outcome, it must be borne in mind that Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.\u00a0 Crucially, our regime is underpinned by substance.

The first one, a Digital Services Tax (DST), proposes a &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; solution of a 3% levy on turnover from certain digital service activities.  The thresholds for application is for a global turnover of &euro;750m and EU turnover of at least &euro;50m.  The second, \"comprehensive solution\", requires an overhaul of international taxation, establishing the concept of a \"digital permanent establishment\", allowing countries taxing rights over the digital business carried out by a company in that country, even where the company has no physical presence in the country.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, the OECD had released their interim Report on the Digital Economy, which acknowledges the lack of consensus in the area and that further analysis is required in order to achieve an agreed evidence backed solution focussed on the alignment of taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission proposals are now being debated and it would seem that there is now a widespread acceptance among Member States that the value of these EU discussions is primarily to give impetus to the OECD debate.  This is illustrated by the recently issued joint statement from the Finance Ministers of Sweden, Denmark and Finland calling for the EU to abandon plans for a digital tax based on turnover and to support reform of digital taxation at OECD.<\/p>  <p>  While a number of Member States remain committed to the interim proposal of a Digital Services Tax on turnover, it should be recalled that the OECD&rsquo;s Task Force on the Digital Economy found that there is no consensus on the merit or need for such short-term measures which it is widely acknowledged can be economically damaging. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seeker Employment","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[30460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the role her Department has played in providing opportunities for asylum seekers to work here; if the information available to her, her Department and the agencies under her remit has contributed to decisions on the way in which asylum seekers can access employment and help to fill skills gaps; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>Policy responsibility for asylum seekers rests with\u00a0my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Minister Flanagan.<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court judgement in NVH v MJE of 30 May 2017 declared that an absolute ban on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to Article 40.1 of the Constitution.\u00a0 Under section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act 2015, an applicant was prohibited from accessing or seeking to access the labour market while their application is being determined.

The IDA\u00a0shares this objective and\u00a0I am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that its results for 2017 show that 45% all jobs created last year were for locations outside Dublin.  Every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year and there are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies outside of Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  Employment numbers\u00a0for 2018 will not be available until\u00a0my Department's\u00a0Annual\u00a0Employment Survey is carried out in November 2018. \u00a0In the last year IDA client companies\u00a0conducted two site visits to County Cavan and one site visit to County Monaghan.  Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0want to stress that\u00a0IDA Ireland\u00a0is working hard to promote Counties Cavan and Monaghan to potential investors.  The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East\/North West Region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre.\u00a0 As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area, it is focusing on sectors including agrifood, manufacturing, tourism, internationally traded services and cleantech.  The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.\u00a0 IDA Ireland also owns lands in both Cavan and Monaghan that are being\u00a0actively marketed to\u00a0its clients.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that foreign direct investment\u00a0only forms one part of investment in regional locations.  Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.\u00a0 My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across this country. <\/p>  <p>  The success of this Government's strategy for regional job creation is reflected in Combilift's new &euro;50 million Research and Development and Testing Centre in County Monaghan.  This new investment will create 200 jobs and is an example of a home-grown Monaghan success story.  The positive impact that Combilift has on the county, the border region and Ireland cannot be underestimated. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Enterprise Ireland supported companies\u00a0employed 10,817 people\u00a0in Cavan and Monaghan in 2017.\u00a0 Companies supported by the LEOs in Cavan and Monaghan employ a total of 2304 people, representing a net increase of 239 over the previous year.  I think that these numbers clearly reflect the growing domestic industries which are so important to both counties.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We recognise that there is room for improvement in\u00a0Cavan and Monaghan\u00a0and we are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the region.  The Enterprise Agencies\u00a0under my remit will\u00a0continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Relations","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[30986\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the contingency planning which has been undertaken in respect of the recent actions of the US Administration in seeking to undermine WTO rules and imposing tariffs on EU imports; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>The Irish Government, along with the rest of the EU Member States, is deeply disappointed with the current direction of US trade policy.  We &ndash; all 28 EU Member States and the EU Commission &ndash; are clear that these tariffs are not justifiable on national security grounds.  We fully subscribe to the EU position that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission, which leads on Trade Policy for the Member States under the Treaties, and working in full consultation with the Member States, has\u00a0prepared a measured, proportionate, and WTO-compatible response, which Ireland has\u00a0fully\u00a0supported.  These measures include the launching of proceedings by the EU against the US at the WTO, the introduction of rebalancing tariff measures by the EU\u00a0and the possible\u00a0imposition of provisional safeguard measures comprising import quotas or tariffs to shield EU producers from a sudden influx of steel or aluminium into the EU market which would ordinarily have been destined for the US market.<\/p>  <p>  EU leaders have also endorsed a positive agenda for dialogue on trade issues with the US, once the steel and aluminium tariffs against the EU are lifted.  Ireland is of the view that the EU should not negotiate under threat, and that any talks must be preceded by a permanent exemption.  The EU and its Member States are also working with other like-minded countries &ndash; such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico &ndash; to develop an agreed approach to issues of concern.  We continue, of course, to keep open the lines of communication with the US Administration and other key &lsquo;influencers&rsquo;.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The US has sought to use the threat of tariffs as leverage to obtain trade concessions from the EU.  The EU&rsquo;s united approach that we are willing and able to respond when necessary in the face of such unilateral non-WTO-compliant actions is vital.  We believe the US Administration is resolute on these issues at this time and, therefore, we believe the EU must remain as resolute and stay united.  The alternative is to accept such action in breach of WTO rules as the EU understands them.  Over the past number of months, the EU has engaged with the US at all possible levels, and with other partners, to find a solution to the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.  Indeed, I met with Secretary Ross in Washington to discuss these and related matters in May.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, we continue to monitor potential impacts of the trade measures being taken by the US, as well as those being contemplated.  We remain alive to the fact that while certain actions may have limited impact at macro level, this could possibly mask individual firm level impacts.  To this end, my Department and its agencies are keeping the situation under review.  Indeed, I convened a meeting of my Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges last week to discuss our strategy and hear, first hand, from a variety of representative bodies, their issues and concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000066#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[30537\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he met the Mayor of New York when he visited the city.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[30076\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to New York on 1 July 2018; the persons who travelled with him; and the meetings he attended.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[30692\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000067#WRE00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent trip to the United States of America and the meetings he had there.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 112 and 120 together.<\/p><p>I travelled to New York on Sunday 1 July to take part in a series of events marking the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s election campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term. <\/p><p>I was joined at a number of these events by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, Minister of State Kehoe, Minister of State Cannon, and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Mark Mellett.  <\/p><p>I was accompanied by a small delegation from my Department which included my Chief of Staff, an Assistant Secretary General, the Assistant Government Press Secretary, my Private Secretary, and a Security Officer from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p>Since joining the UN in 1955, Ireland has made a sustained contribution to the international community&rsquo;s efforts to tackle important global challenges like peace and security, human rights, international development, climate change and sustainable development.<\/p><p>We have always sought to be an active and fair member of the international community and we have a responsibility to actively engage with the UN. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for the UN Security Council will deepen our UN engagement.

A short-list is drawn up based on the specific criteria set out by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience.  However, the final decision rests with the inviting body, usually the OSCE or the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The recent call for Election Observers to participate in the upcoming EU EOM to Zimbabwe attracted a high volume of applications with a total of twenty four Short-Term and eight Long-Term Observer applications.

The area is inhabited by members of the Jahalin tribe, which was expelled from its home in the Negev to the West Bank in the 1950s.  One village in particular, that of Khan Al Ahmar, home to some 181 Palestinian Bedouin, 95% of whom are Palestinian refugees, has been under threat of demolition for many years.<\/p>  <p>  The communities are located in a particularly sensitive part of Area C in the West Bank, an area which is critical for the viability of a future Palestinian state.  Any attempt to develop the land for illegal settlements is therefore a threat to the Two State solution.  There is no doubt that the removal of the Bedouin community to another site, to which they have not agreed, is illegal under international law.<\/p>  <p>  These plans have been subject to a number of legal proceedings.  Many in the international community, including Ireland, have raised our concerns on numerous occasions with the Israeli authorities.  As a result of international pressure and legal actions plans for the demolition had been delayed. However, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in May 2018, the Israeli authorities were given permission by that court to proceed with the demolition.<\/p>  <p>  The UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process has said that the proposed demolition in Khan Al Ahmar is contrary to international law and has called on Israel to halt the demolitions.<\/p>  <p>  I have made two public statements in relation to Khan al Ahmar specifically, on 31 May and most recently on 4 July, calling on the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.  I also condemned the demolitions and the forced evictions of the neighbouring Palestinian community of Abu Nuwar.  The Irish Representative in Ramallah has visited Khan al Ahmar on a number of occasions, along with other European Missions, as a show of support for the villagers.  Ireland has also pressed strongly for EU action on this, and the EU has issued statements in Brussels and at local level calling on the Israeli authorities to reverse the decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Following Palestinian petitions last Thursday, the Israeli High Court has issued a temporary restraining order freezing the demolition of Khan Al Ahmar.  The Court has ordered the Israeli authorities to respond to the Palestinian claims by 11 July before making a decision whether to accept or reject the petition. <\/p>  <p>  I again call upon the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.

Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including 1.5 million people trapped in hard-to-reach and besieged areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &quot;starve or surrender&quot; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. <\/p><p>I am particularly concerned by the recent escalation of violence in the south west, including air strikes by the regime and its allies, which forced over 300,000 civilians from their homes and destroyed critical infrastructure including several health facilities.  I am aware of the report to which Deputy Shortall refers which highlights some of the shocking attacks that have taken place in Daraa province in recent weeks.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I take this opportunity to call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the respect of the de-escalation agreement and full humanitarian access to all Syrians in need.<\/p><p>I have frequently called on all regional actors, and all those involved in the Syria conflict, to show restraint and avoid any escalation, which could further undermine regional stability, as well as adding to the suffering of civilians.  I have also called on all parties with influence on the Syrian regime to exert that influence to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. <\/p><p>It is clear that Russia's support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people.  Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians.  Ireland's has communicated its concerns directly to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions.  In October 2017, I met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov.  I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s condemnation of the ongoing attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the use of chemical weapons.  I called on Russia to ensure civilians are protected, and to exert its influence on other parties to the conflict to do the same.  These messages have also been relayed to the Russian Ambassador on numerous occasions at Ministerial and official level.<\/p><p>I am aware of the issue related to property rights to which Deputy Shortall refers.  Ireland recently co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council that &quot;deplores the existence and application of national legislation, in particular 'Syrian Law Number 10\/2018', which would have a significant detrimental impact on freedom of movement and the right of Syrians displaced by the conflict to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it, and calls for their repeal&quot;.<\/p><p>Ireland and the EU believe that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict.  The human suffering caused by the Syrian conflict can only be brought to an end by reaching a sustainable political solution.  Ireland and the EU fully support UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in his efforts to lead political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.<\/p><p>Ireland and the EU also provide political and financial support to a broad range of measures which aim to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the UN Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN.  Last month, Ireland co-sponsored the decision adopted by the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention introducing an attribution mechanism to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria and elsewhere.<i><\/i>In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures.<\/p><p>The EU and its Member States constitute the largest single donor to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis and have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.6 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.  The EU hosted two international donors&rsquo; conferences for Syria in April 2017 and April 2018 at which pledges totalling over &euro;9 billion were made.<\/p><p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million in humanitarian assistance to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, making this Ireland&rsquo;s largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years.  In 2017 alone, Ireland provided almost &euro;25.5 million to the humanitarian response.  At the 2018 Brussels Donor conference, Ireland pledged to contribute a further &euro;25 million in 2018 and almost &euro;22 million of this has been disbursed so far.  Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Election Monitoring Missions","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02100"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[30793\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if all members of election monitoring panels are informed of the make-up of each election monitoring delegation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>International election monitoring missions play an important role in the promotion of democracy and human rights.

Conditions are likely to deteriorate over the coming months as the monsoon season progresses.<\/p>  <p>  This exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts by the international community to address this crisis have focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis, promoting a political solution and pressing for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred.<\/p>  <p>  While efforts aimed at achieving accountability and a political solution to the crisis are vitally important, there is an immediate need for a coherent humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh.  To this end, Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1 million allocated for 2018. Our support has focused on food, shelter, water and sanitation.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response facility, we have provided 37 tonnes of hygiene, sanitation and shelter kits and deployed experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination on the ground.  In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland's estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.<\/p>  <p>  In Northern Rakhine, Ireland provided funding to the Red Cross at the end of 2017 to provide cash transfers to 10,000 households and food and non-food items to 20,000 households; first health and assisted childbirth services; access to sanitation for 5,000 households; and reunification of separated families in Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  Elsewhere in Myanmar, over the course of 2017-18, Ireland is providing over &euro;3.5 million to humanitarian and development NGOs, primarily to Tr&oacute;caire for its work on gender equality, resource rights and humanitarian assistance to conflict affected communities.<\/p>  <p>  Humanitarian access in Northern Rakhine has been extremely limited since the start of this crisis.  Only the Red Cross Movement and to a lesser extent the World Food Programme have access.  As a result it has not been possible to provide adequate lifesaving assistance to the estimated 100,000-150,000 Rohingya that remain in Rakhine, or to other affected persons in that region.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has strongly and consistently pressed for humanitarian access to Myanmar and has added its voice to that of the international community in pushing for this crucial first step in addressing the humanitarian crisis.  I repeat that call here and for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.  The report of the Commission urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full and unimpeded humanitarian access &ndash; for both national and international staff &ndash; at all times and to all communities in Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  An intensive political response by the international community continues to be pursued and on 6 June, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been agreed between the Myanmar government, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the UN Development Programme, to establish a framework for cooperation between the parties aimed at creating conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of these refugees from Bangladesh to their places of origin.  The MoU also aims to help create improved and resilient livelihoods for all communities living in Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively engage with our international partners in supporting these efforts through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses including at the recent 38th Session of the Human Rights Council.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position including in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Council Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February last.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, support the mandates of the Fact Finding Mission and Special Rapporteur and provide for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for these acts.  Targeted sanctions have since been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassies in Thailand and in Hanoi who are closely monitoring the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Security Council","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[30812\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of staff who have been designated to work on Ireland's bid for a seat at the UN Security Council; if staff have been seconded from other Departments or outside agencies to work on the bid; if so, the number seconded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[30813\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the budget allocated for Ireland's bid to win a seat on the UN Security Council; the breakdown of the budget allocated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[30814\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if other events have been planned for Ireland's bid to win a seat on the UN Security Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[30848\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the cost of Ireland's campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council; the reason the campaign has not focused on Ireland's history and policy of neutrality in international affairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 to 156, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is seeking election to a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.

One secondment is currently envisaged to assist with the implementation of the Global Ireland initiative and this will include support to the Security Council campaign among other tasks.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to Dublin based staff, Ireland&rsquo;s Mission to the UN in New York is also fully engaged on the election effort.  I would also stress that the campaign is a whole of Department, and whole of Government, undertaking.  Thus messaging and activities relevant to Ireland&rsquo;s candidature are being integrated into the work of all sections and offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as that of other Government departments.<\/p>  <p>  Up to this point Ireland&rsquo;s UN Security Council campaign has been managed within existing resources by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As we move forward there will be a need for additional resources to promote Ireland&rsquo;s candidature as we seek to secure support from UN Member States.<\/p>  <p>  Over the coming two years until the election in June 2020, Ireland will seek to build awareness of our achievements and experience globally.  This will be realised through the use of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network, engagement on substantive policy issues at the UN, and the organisation of events on a range of themes which will highlight Ireland&rsquo;s track record globally and our principled commitment to the value of multilateralism.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality goes hand in hand with our promotion of international peace and security, including our obligations as members of the United Nations.  This aspect of our history and track record as a UN Member State is one which has resonated across the membership of the UN since we joined in 1955 and we continue to highlight it.  The themes of empathy, partnership and independence are intended to capture Ireland&rsquo;s lived experience and outlook, giving primacy to cooperation, agreement and reasonable compromise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":238,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, answered with Question No. 148.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[30887\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will request Jordan and Israel to urgently provide safe haven to civilians fleeing military attack; his views on the creation of UN managed humanitarian corridors to facilitate the evacuation of civilians; if unilateral funding will be provided immediately for the creation of camps for potentially 750,000 persons fleeing the attacks; and if he will request that adequate EU funding is provided for same in the longer term.","asker":"1222","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>I am deeply concerned about the recent upsurge in violence in south-western Syria, which has led to the displacement of over 300,000 people.  This is a further deterioration of the terrible situation inside Syria, where over 13 million people require humanitarian assistance.  An additional 5.6 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. Ireland recognises that countries in the region have more than played their part.  Jordan as an example, is the second-largest refugee hosting country in the world when compared to the size of its population.<\/p>  <p>  The safety and protection of civilians inside Syria is an utmost priority and I call on all parties to respect their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I reiterate my call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and respect for the de-escalation agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Crucially, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access must be facilitated. UN agencies and partners are providing support to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to respond to the urgent needs of the displaced.  This includes health, water and sanitation, food, shelter and other core relief items as well as ensuring the protection of civilians. In addition, UN convoys, in cooperation with the Government of Jordan, have in recent days transported assistance for the tens of thousands of Syrians near the Jordanian border.  These efforts must be sustained and increased.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million towards the Syria crisis since 2012.  Our humanitarian assistance responds to those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in neighbouring countries.  During a recent visit to a refugee camp in Jordan, where I witnessed first-hand the impact of Ireland's humanitarian assistance, I announced a further &euro;1.25 million in funding for the valuable work of UNICEF and UNHCR.<\/p>  <p>  At the recent meeting of EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Development on June 25th I discussed with my EU counterparts the issue of Syrian refugees from south-western Syria and possible solutions.  Last April, the EU hosted the Brussels II Conference for Syria and the Region, which included a focus on sustaining and increasing humanitarian assistance to all those affected by the crisis in Syria, including Syrian refugees and vulnerable communities in neighbouring countries.  The EU and its Member States contributed &euro;4.8 billion out of the total &euro;6.2 billion pledged until 2020, to support both immediate assistance and longer term response.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for sustained European response to this crisis.  Ultimately, only a political solution to the conflict will end the suffering of the Syrian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000069#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":243,"content":"<p>Question No. 161 answered with Question No. 148.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH00300"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[31549\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of public sector jobs offered as internal competitions or restricted to existing civil service or public service staff in his Department in 2017 and to date in 2018;

Prior to 1 July 2013, collection of the original &euro;100 HHC was the responsibility of the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on behalf of the Local Authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  With regards to the Local Property Tax, the Government decided that a liability to the LPT should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions.  As a matter of Government policy, and in order to keep the rate of the tax low, the Government agreed that reliefs should be targeted at owner occupiers where there is inability to pay the tax.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or qualifying cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not, \"as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date\" exceed these thresholds in that year.  <\/p>  <p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons\/civil partners\/cohabitants.  The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting.  The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT are available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances.  The LPT can be paid by way of phased payments rather than in a single payment; it can also be paid by direct debit; or through payment service providers such as An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0have initiated a review of the LPT which is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments.  It includes an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax.  It is expected that the review will be completed at the end of August and that the review report will provide a number of policy choices for consideration.  The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.  It also included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[30100\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has identified laws which are dependent on or in place as a consequence of Article 41.2 of the Constitution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1310","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is probably aware of,\u00a0a constitutional referendum\u00a0has been proposed to amend or repeal Article 41.2 of the Constitution.

The Commission was set up as an independent body with its own vote and Accounting Officer and is a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant additional resources have\u00a0been applied to the TAC since its inception with the staffing levels more than doubling over its first two years of operation.  Where additional resources have been sought to date, my Department have engaged with each request received.  Indeed the budget for the TAC has almost quadrupled between 2014 and 2018 despite the fact that in 2016 and 2017 the TAC did not spend its full budget allocation.  <\/p>  <p>  The following information relates to staffing requests received from the TAC.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2016 the TAC proposed the re-engagement of two former Commissioners on a temporary basis.  This was followed in July 2016 by a request to recruit two additional temporary clerical staff.  The re-engagement of the former Commissioners was not considered to be in keeping with the mandate of openness and transparency, so in July 2016 sanction was instead given for the appointment of 5 temporary Appeal Commissioners, to be appointed by a competitive process, and 2 full-time clerical staff.  <\/p>  <p>  An amended request was received from the TAC in August 2016\u00a0for 4 clerical staff (to include the 2 clerical staff sanctioned in July), and this was sanctioned in August 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In February 2017, following the return to D\/Finance of an experienced Principal Officer on secondment to assist with the set-up of the TAC, the TAC requested the secondment of another experienced Principal Officer from my Department.  The position was filled by the appointment of a Principal Officer on secondment from the Department of Finance in May 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In August 2017 a request was made by the TAC for 2 additional tax qualified staff at Assistant Principal level to act as case managers and this request was sanctioned.  In parallel to commencing the recruitment process via the Public Appointments Service (PAS) the TAC requested that my Department consider filling some of these positions by sending further staff to the TAC on secondment.  This was not possible as my Department has a limited number of staff with the requisite qualifications\/skills and experience and is also dealing with staffing challenges caused by an annual turnover rate of over 23% (including resignations, retirements and staff that have moved to other Departments through promotions etc.).  My officials offered assistance with the process of recruitment via PAS, including the provision of interview board members if required.  The assistance of my Department's HR manager to provide advice and guidance has also been offered to the TAC, but the TAC to date have not availed of this offer.  <\/p>  <p>  The TAC's 2018 Estimates were submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in September 2017, noting that the required additional staffing from January 2018 would be 2 Assistant Principal case managers (the 2 case managers requested in August for which recruitment had commenced), 1 Assistant Principal, 1 Higher Executive Officer and 1 temporary Clerical Officer.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0This request was sanctioned, and my Department facilitated the transfer of an experienced Higher Executive Officer on secondment to the TAC in October 2017.  I understand that the 2 Assistant Principal case managers were appointed in January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2018, the Accounting Officer of the Commission submitted a request to my Department for significant additional\u00a0resources\u00a0to meet the increased caseload of the Commission, including an additional 10 administrative staff.  The addition of these resources\u00a0would involve an effective doubling of the Commission&rsquo;s budget for 2018 from &euro;1.626 million to an estimated &euro;3.226 million which includes extra resources for ICT and new office space.  <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Due to the substantial increase in public resources now being sought by the TAC,\u00a0my officials requested further information to support the resource request to ensure that the proposed balance of administrative staff and the existing Commissioners would be effective in addressing\u00a0that workload.  The TAC informed\u00a0my Department in early March of this year that it had commenced commissioning a review of its resources and operations.  I am awaiting receipt of this report and, in the meantime, I have commissioned an\u00a0independent reviewer with significant experience of civil service bodies and operations to assess the current position and advise how best to address the TAC's resource needs.  This review has been expedited in order that resourcing decisions, based on a sound business case for the resolution of the current backlog, can be made as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[30865\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000070#WRH04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to have a bilateral meeting with his Canadian counterpart, Mr. Bill Morneau; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>I have no bilateral meeting currently scheduled with Minister Morneau.

of the remaining 49 deadlines, 40 have been met.\u00a0 Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in parallel with those from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.\u00a0 It is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations from both Reports cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive motor insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  I believe however that it is important to acknowledge that the average cost of motor insurance has been consistently falling since the middle of 2016, with the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicating that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.\u00a0 While it is accepted that premiums are still at a very high level for many people, such statistics indicate at the very least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis.\u00a0 I believe that the endeavours of the Working Group have contributed to this positive trend in pricing, as well as putting in motion much needed reform in other related areas, such as data transparency, the interaction between insurance companies and consumers, and the personal injuries claims environment.\u00a0 While there is still much work to be done, I consider that the Cost of Insurance Working Group project has already proven to be a worthwhile and fruitful exercise overall.\u00a0 In addition, I am of the view that its work must continue to be a priority for Government and would urge all relevant Departments to continue prioritising the implementation of the recommendations of the Reports.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would recommend drivers who are seeking or renewing insurance to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website, which has a highly informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.\u00a0 One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000071#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000071#WRJ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[31547\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000071#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of public sector jobs offered as internal competitions or restricted to existing Civil Service or public service staff in his Department in 2017 and to date in 2018;

This amendment will give the Minister the power to compel a school to open a special class or classes where the National Council for Special Education has identified a need for such provision within an area.<\/p><p>These proposed measures would further enhance the ability of my Department and the NCSE to plan for special class provision and to address issues in provision that may arise from time in time at local levels.<\/p><p>Guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes are available to download from <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[30330\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an agreement to develop a project (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>A\u00a0copy of a business case in relation to the project referred to by the Deputy has been received and is being\u00a0considered by my Department.<\/p><p>Funding for such centres in the Education and\u00a0Training Board sector\u00a0is approved on the basis that they are self-financing and that their financial activities would be separate from the overall ETB finances.<\/p><p>My Department is considering the\u00a0business case received and any implications that might arise from it and will engage with the body concerned in relation to same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[30346\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000073#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of extending the medical card waiver to all students eligible for concessionary school transport.","asker":"1266","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Currently over 116,000 children, including\u00a0over 12,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.

This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.).

The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers and cleaners) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.

This pilot project was funded by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).<\/p>  <p>  According to TII, an analysis of driver behaviour carried out in October 2015 confirmed that 58% of drivers using the Dublin Port Tunnel exceeded the 80 km\/h speed limit, and 20% exceeded this limit by more than 10 km\/h. <\/p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the average speed camera system at the Dublin Port Tunnel, the percentage of drivers exceeding the limit by more than 10 km\/h has fallen to 0.15%. This suggests that the system has had a significant effect on driver behaviour. TII also emphasises that this reduction in excessive speed is particularly notable, occurring, as it does, against the backdrop of increasing weekday traffic volumes, with Monday-Friday traffic volumes rising by 40% over the past five years.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of this system, speed checks at the Dublin Port Tunnel were conducted using handheld laser-based technology, and required a Garda presence to identify and intercept speeding vehicles. For safety reasons, these checks could only be conducted outside the tunnel and, therefore, could not influence driver behaviour inside the tunnel itself. <\/p>  <p>  The average speed camera system allows the enforcement of the speed limit within the tunnel itself, with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) used to identify vehicles that have exceeded the speed limit and the relevant fixed charge notices (FCNs) are issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without the vehicle being intercepted.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that TII has recommended the extension of the average speed camera project for an additional four years and has committed to continuing its funding and operation of the system during the extension period.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of speed enforcement on other roads, I would remind the Deputy that this is accomplished by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the use of both intercept and non-intercept methods, with safety cameras being used in specific locations, known as speed enforcement zones, around the country in order to provide non-intercept detection of speeding vehicles. <\/p>  <p>  The overall impact of the safety cameras can be seen in the impact on the fatal collisions in the designated speed enforcement zones. The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones. In 2015, this figure had reduced to 16% (or 24 road deaths) in safety camera zones.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the deployment of Garda resources is, of course, a matter for the Garda Commissioner, and I, Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in such operational matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000077#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000077#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[30031\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000077#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is a cut-off point for a person who has had a deportation order for a number of years (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the information requested by the Deputy is\u00a0as set out below.<\/p><p>The statutory criteria which must be considered in relation to a decision to make a deportation order under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 include national security and public policy, the character and conduct of the person concerned and the common good.

I expect to bring the Bill to Government very shortly for agreement to publish.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree that it has taken\u00a0considerably longer than I had wished or intended, to finalise the Bill for publication.  The reasons for this are genuine.  It is a complex Bill, both in drafting terms and on the substance.  The Deputy will be aware that this Bill will, among other matters, make provision regarding coronial investigation of maternal deaths, in response to the Private Member's Bill tabled by Deputy Clare Daly in that regard.\u00a0Both\u00a0Deputy Daly's Bill, and much of the work done by my Department on the reform of coronial law, refer\u00a0to the text of the\u00a0Coroners Bill 2007, which\u00a0provided for a comprehensive reform of coronial law and of the administrative structure of the coroner service in Ireland.  That administrative reform requires significant updating and is not yet ready to proceed.

However,\u00a0I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to take all forms of anti-social and drug-related behaviour very seriously. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities, particularly in the summer months and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.<\/p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in\u00a0Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.<\/p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society. For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which\u00a0inter alia supports\u00a0Garda\u00a0activity to tackle these types of problems.<\/p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are\u00a0raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.\u00a0To this end, the House will be aware that 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting recently. The new recruits are visible proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 including 15,000 Garda members. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Provision","counter":728,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR02600"},{"type":"question","counter":729,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[30860\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if additional funding will be provided to purchase additional Garda vehicles between July 2018 and year end; if so, the number of vehicles that will be purchased; when those vehicles will be brought into the fleet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":730,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.\u00a0This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.

There are also 558 Garda Reserves and more than 2,300 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.

Changes to the Scheme will be subject to further consultations with the Office of the Attorney General and other relevant Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The key element of the Government Decision of 10 January 2018 is the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality. <\/p>  <p>  This approach to independent regulation is, I believe, critical for the development of modern gambling legislation. It mirrors the situation in most EU Member States and would bring Ireland in line with best international practice.<\/p>  <p>  An independent regulator would offer assurance that decision-making would be free from any potentially undue influence. <\/p>  <p>  Effective modern licensing, regulation and enforcement of the gambling industry will require additional significant resources, primarily for the operation of the new regulatory authority. Similar authorities in other EU Member States involve significant staff numbers and IT provision.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of reviewing and updating the General Scheme in all necessary aspects, a Working Group, chaired by myself, comprising all stakeholder Departments, relevant Offices and the Office of the Attorney General has been meeting since February 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  I expect the Group to submit its report to Government in early Autumn, with work on a revised General Scheme to follow thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the media report referred to by the Deputy and I am confident that the measures I will bring forward will help to address the issues contained therein.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Accommodation","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR05100"},{"type":"question","counter":754,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[30919\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is a budget allocation to refurbish and make habitable official Garda living accommodation.","asker":"1276","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

They are also matters on which I can assure the Deputy both my Department and the Authority are in ongoing discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  As had been reflected in my Written Reply to Question No. 404 of 13 July 2017, the Authority has been supported in this endeavour by an advance of &euro;1 million during each of the years 2016 and 2017 from my Department's Vote and a similar allocation of &euro;1 million has been made for the current year. These advances are being made, as provided under section 32 of the 2015 Act, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the purposes of expenditure by the Authority in the performance of its functions. As also reflected in that Written Reply and since set out in more detail in the Authority's published Annual Report for 2017, the Authority spent its first year completing a series of statutory and time-bound reports and public consultations while also establishing a start-up office and recruiting its first full-time Chief Executive who was appointed in November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the 2015 Act, a number of legal and technical issues have arisen in relation to the practical application of the funding framework that the Act provides. These provisions were intended, from a policy perspective, to provide the means whereby the Authority, having been funded for an initial and short start-up period on a recoupable basis, could then become self-funding in the longer term. This would be achieved by means of a levy based on actual expenditure by the Authority in the immediately preceding financial year and raised from those legal practitioners being regulated in the terms currently set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act. The fact that the effective roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions will require substantially more time than initially considered and that the levy also needs time to generate actual income have revealed a potential gap in the original model of recoupability that now needs to be reconsidered and resolved. This is made more complex because the levy is also intrinsically linked, in its application, to a number of other measures including the current work of the Authority in setting-up the Roll of Practising Barristers in support of which I recently commenced the necessary provisions of Part 9 of the 2015 Act. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, therefore, acknowledged the Authority's position, which it has reflected in its risk register, that the levy provisions as drafted in the 2015 Act may not, in their practical implementation and in the transpiring circumstances of the start-up, provide an adequate source of funding to the Authority and may not similarly provide for the recoupability of advances as may originally have been foreseen. My Department has also been informed by the Authority that it has engaged a financial consultant to examine the current levy provisions and to provide an expert economic\/financial opinion on them. This is expected to be provided soon and will be given early and detailed consideration by my Department and the Authority in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are, as I have said, aware of the issues concerned. Both my Department and the Authority are committed, on that basis, to the prompt and robust analysis and examination of the funding provisions within the 2015 Act to ensure that there is a sustainable levy-based framework under which the Authority is sufficiently funded going forward to fulfil its broad remit as a new regulatory body. We also wish to ensure that there is no setback to the progress it has made to date and to the important programme of reform it has undertaken under its Strategic Plan for 2018-2020. Along with the relevant officials of my Department I will, therefore, be giving detailed consideration to any necessary measures proposed including legislative amendments or refinements, if any, that may be considered appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":768,"content":"<p>Question No. 341 answered with Question No. 332.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Statelessness Determination Process","counter":769,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06700"},{"type":"question","counter":770,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[31046\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of individual applications for recognition of statelessness that have been received.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[31047\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR06900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of individual applications for recognition of statelessness that were granted in each of the years 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[31048\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000079#WRR07000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the average time to make a determination on an application for the recognition of statelessness.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":773,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 to 344, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Statelessness results from the complex interaction of many legal and other factors.

This analysis can include the identification of any reasons for shortages or barriers to participation in particular sectors. Its follow up work involves engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, Higher Education Authority, SOLAS and other relevant bodies to produce an agreed action plan to address the skills needs identified. <\/p>  <p>  Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or skills implications relevant to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, trade related skill sets in the context of Brexit and digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the new national skills architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills, which, together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and information on employment permit trends, provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates the prioritisation of investment in identified skills needs, and enhancing the responses by education and training providers to provision and delivery of those needs.<\/p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and the SLMRU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit. This Unit has the responsibility for the employment permits system which is managed by the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and the Ineligible Categories List.

The objective is balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is a genuine one. The rationale underpinning the inclusion or omission from the occupation lists is informed by EGFSN, the SLMRU and is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions. This process is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is operating efficiently. <\/p>  <p>  The analysis of the Expert Group on Future Skills has been reflected in the overarching strategies for the education and training system published in recent years.

This will drive export growth to international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK. <\/p>  <p>  There is now a major focus on directing resources and expertise to the Eurozone markets where EI sees opportunities, targeting a 50% increase in exports by 2020. A new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; communications campaign is targeting Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.<\/p>  <p>  There are also significant opportunities in various other international markets for quality Irish goods and services. The future relative importance and forecasted growth rates of China, India, the South-East Asian countries, the Gulf States, Latin America and Africa combined with the scale of these markets means we will support Irish companies to continue to work to build exports in these markets. In January of this year, EI launched its new Market Discovery Fund to help more Irish companies accelerate their market diversification efforts. <\/p>  <p>  EI is undertaking 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of EI clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets. The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, reflecting the serious challenge that Brexit poses for Irish businesses.<\/p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs.\u00a0 I will continue to work with my Department and EI to ensure Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agrifood, will continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically. <\/p>  <p>  Innovation remains at the forefront of any business to ensure that they grow and expand to ensure they are at a level to compete on the EU and global markets effectively.\u00a0 Innovation involves helping companies improve competitiveness by developing new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.\u00a0 Innovation is an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in overseas markets.\u00a0 EI has a suite of supports available to assist client companies innovate and develop their enterprise.\u00a0 These supports help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable export growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS04800"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[30997\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS04900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which business expansion can rely on innovation as a means of improving efficiency and competitiveness in the global marketplace; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":820,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[31006\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS05000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which innovation remains an integral part of Ireland's campaign to maximise its industrial impact in terms of effective trading, efficiency and modernisation with particular reference to competing on EU and world markets; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":821,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 and 367 together.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland drives innovation in Irish industry by developing in-company capabilities and by leveraging all external assets, such as the higher education system, the investor community, the Foreign Direct Investment Multinational base and international funding\/expertise to support company innovations.  <\/p>  <p>  Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) are essential components in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in global markets. Supporting research and innovation will therefore continue to remain an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to maximise impact in EU and global markets. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s support for research, development and innovation involves helping companies improve their competitiveness through the development of new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland's core objective is to help companies start, grow, innovate and win export sales in global markets and there are financial and non-financial supports available at every stage of that journey to the point where companies are in a position to export to new markets. Enterprise Ireland supported clients have grown and achieved total exports of over &euro;21bn per annum and achieved the benefits of same such as increased profits and company growth. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic aim is to increase this figure to &euro;26bn per annum by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of innovation, more specifically, Enterprise Ireland supports and de-risks RDI by supporting companies to do RDI in-house, by supporting collaboration with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); or by sourcing\/licensing new technologies from HEIs which can provide a step change in their innovative capabilities.  At the same time Enterprise Ireland has supports in place to help companies maximise the funding they can receive from the European Union through programmes such as Horizon 2020.  These supports all help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is forcing Irish companies employ RDI in a bid to protect their current exports in the UK and to explore different markets and innovation will continue to play a central role in this regard.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s annual business results survey shows that companies that invest in innovation are higher performing in terms of employment, export sales and are more sustainable through recessionary and other economic shocks such as Brexit.  It is essential that Irish companies produce products and services that are more novel than their competitors, better performing, more efficiently delivered, and cost effective for their customers.   <\/p>  <p>  There are a wide range of Enterprise Ireland RD&amp;I Programmes available to companies and they all contribute hugely to company development, growth and expansion, some of which are outlined below: <\/p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I<\/p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I supports the development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes which will have a competitive advantage in their target market. The Agile Innovation Fund launched in Quarter 4 2017 now facilitates fast track approval of such awards. <\/p>  <p>  Commercialisation Fund <\/p>  <p>  The Commercialisation Fund is aimed at improving the competitiveness of Irish industry through both the creation of technology-based companies and through the development of licenses.  It is available for projects that address a gap or need in the market by developing innovations that will ideally be ready for licensing to Irish industry or may form the basis of a new start-within 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  Innovation Vouchers <\/p>  <p>  The Innovation Voucher initiative provides vouchers worth &euro;5,000 to small businesses to introduce them to research, development and innovation, linking them with a network of knowledge providers, North and South of the border.  <\/p>  <p>  Innovation Partnerships <\/p>  <p>  The Innovation Partnership programme helps industry to engage in collaborative research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology to develop new products and services.<\/p>  <p>  Technology Gateways <\/p>  <p>  The Technology Gateway Programme provides Business Development resources to the Institutes of Technology to help them interact with industry on a local, regional and national basis.<\/p>  <p>  Technology Centres<\/p>  <p>  Technology Centres are organised to respond rapidly to industry defined needs and conduct market-relevant R&amp;D in partnership with collaborating groups of companies.<\/p>  <p>  Campus Incubators <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland funding has supported the development of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities. Incubators now exist on every university and Institute of Technology Campus in the country. Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology intensive start-ups. They are also an important driver of regional development with the majority of companies remaining in their region after they have completed their incubation period.  <\/p>  <p>  EU Funding<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to lead the Horizon 2020 National Support Network in order to secure as much Irish engagement with this funding programme as possible.  This assistance available from the European Union for new enterprises, is the instrument which supports collaborative R&amp;D in Europe and provides an important source of non-exchequer funding for companies. Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation, exports and sales.<\/p>  <p>The Horizon 2020 SME Instrument   is available and is specifically for single or groups of highly innovative SMEs with international ambitions, determined to turn strong, innovative business ideas into winners on the market.  The instrument provides full-cycle business innovation support from the stage of business idea conception and planning over business plan execution and demonstration to commercialisation. <\/p>  <p>The research and innovation supports provided by Enterprise Ireland and other agencies of my Department will be complemented by the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund  .  This new Fund is specifically targeted at game-changing innovations that will have a significant impact on the ability of companies in Ireland to compete in global markets. Expressions of Interest are now invited from consortia wishing to apply for funding under this new Fund. The type of projects that will receive funding will be:<\/p>  <p>  - Collaborative enterprise-driven partnerships that will develop, deploy and commercialise disruptive technologies to transform business;<\/p>  <p>  - Impactful projects focused on &ldquo;industrial research&rdquo; and seeking at least &euro;1 million in funding over 3 years and involving enterprises and research partners;<\/p>  <p>  - Projects with at least one SME partner &ndash; this is an essential requirement in every consortium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000080#WRS05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":823,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 360 to 362, inclusive, answered with Question No. 358.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":824,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":825,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[31002\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which enterprise led by women continues to be supported and promoted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":826,"content":"<p>Female founders have traditionally been under-represented in start-ups, and that is why my Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives aimed at supporting women to start and scale businesses that provide quality jobs throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is committed to supporting cohorts of ambitious, capable founders, and placing them on faster growth trajectories.  Research undertaken by EI in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates and developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which EI supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.\u00a0 The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012.  Since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these targeted Funds is to accelerate the growth of female founded start-up companies that have the potential to employ more than 10 people and achieve &euro;1 million in export sales within three years.  This is achieved by putting a &euro;50,000 equity investment in the company.  The Funds are designed to enable companies to reach key commercial and technical milestones, which will ensure the delivery of their product or service to an international audience. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.  EI received over 100 funding applications for this Fund and the final selection for funding is currently taking place.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, 46 per cent of all companies who received CSF investment from Enterprise Ireland were female founded.<\/p>  <p>  Another key Enterprise Ireland initiative is the Going for Growth programme.  Currently in its 10th cycle, the initiative supports female entrepreneurs who have been trading for at least two years and are strongly focussed on growth.  For zero fee, participants are offered a unique learning environment with a peer-led approach based on the shared experiences of both the Lead Entrepreneur and the other participants facing similar challenges.  Feedback shows that participants&rsquo; businesses experienced a growth in sales over the 9th cycle of over &euro;20million and employment rose by 17.5%.<\/p>  <p>  Every year EI holds a Fuelling Ambition Roadshow, which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs (existing and new) nationally by showcasing thriving Irish female entrepreneurs.  A total of 7 roadshow events were held in 2018, attended by c600 female entrepreneurs, across the country during March, April and May in Waterford, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Killarney, Monaghan and Roscommon.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  Last year we saw the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day rolled out on a regional basis.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) Programme, run by the LEOS, has also been strongly supportive of female entrepreneurs.  Since it began in 2014 over 1430 applicants (over 37% of total applicants) have been female.<\/p>  <p>  We are making progress.  The number of female founded start-ups supported by EI has increased from 12 in 2011 to 67 in 2017.\u00a0 This includes a significant increase in the proportion of female founded High Potential Start-ups supported by EI which accounted for 28% of EI HPSUs in 2017 compared to 7% in 2011.  In addition, 61% of participants attending LEO training programmes in 2017 were female while 46% of the LEO mentoring participants were female. <\/p>  <p>  I feel confident that with continued support we will continue to see increases in female led businesses in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":828,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[31003\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which the appropriate authorities at EU level continue to offer support by way of innovation, technology or other expertise in anticipation of Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":829,"content":"<p>Horizon 2020 is the current EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.

The annual cost of the Mobility Allowance scheme at the time that it closed was &euro;9.3 million.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist person with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following the closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.  The annual cost of the Motorised Transport Grant scheme at the time that it closed was &euro;1.3 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme, to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I recently brought a Memorandum to Government for proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet agenda on 8 May last.  I intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussion at Cabinet, in due course.<\/p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on the specific proposals under consideration, I can confirm that the proposals seek to ensure that:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT03900"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[30883\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the basis upon which public sector recruitment may be restricted to existing staff, including the basis for the common recruitment competition pools operated by the HSE; and his plans to amend legislation to prevent the use of such pools.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04200"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[30949\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000081#WRT04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when and the way in which an organisation (details supplied) decided not to provide therapies in a school in view of the fact it received funding to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

2026&rsquo; was published in January 2016.  In addition to population needs, international trends and the findings of a public consultation process, the development of the Strategy was informed by previous reports and experiences of our maternity services, both positive and negative. Indeed, the development of the Strategy delivered on a recommendation from the report, Investigation into the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway, and as reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavar.  Consequently, many recommendations made in past reports are addressed in the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised - are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  It recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.  <\/p>  <p>  The phased implementation of the Strategy is being led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, which has been established in the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care.  One of the Programme's objectives is to ensure, where relevant, that learning from individual sites is disseminated to all maternity hospitals\/units nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  Additional development funding of &euro;4.15 million is being allocated to maternity services this year.  The Programme has prioritised improving quality and safety, establishing community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans.  Such initiatives represent essential building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service and will continue to deliver tangible benefits for the 80,000 families who access maternity care each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000083#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":923,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000083#WRV01000"},{"type":"question","counter":924,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[30066\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000083#WRV01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if general practitioner cards will be extended to all carers in receipt of the respite care support grant.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":925,"content":"<p>In December 2017, the Government  announced that additional funding would be provided to enable all carers in receipt of Carer's Allowance to qualify for a GP visit card.

Majority of those with the disease are seen in the two centres of expertise - Our Lady's Children Hospital in Crumlin and St. James's Hospital. To ensure an early diagnosis and prevent early deaths, the team at Crumlin, over many years, organised a neo-natal screening in the majority of maternity hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  Sickle cell disease, among many other rare diseases, is addressed as part of the generic policy framework in the National Rare disease plan which was published in 2014.  The scope of the plan is broad given that there are 8,000 rare diseases approximately affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare.<\/p>  <p>  One of the achievements of the Rare Disease Plan was to encourage designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients. Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patient' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations in the national plan related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process. It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June 2016 during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs and two were approved.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings. It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries. This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. At the EU level, the Joint Research Centre is developing a joint European Platform on Rare Disease Registration which will promote EU level standards for data collection and contribute to the development of rare disease registries across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister I consider meeting any organisation that requests to do so.

The Review is a multi-year project which is resulting in very significant changes to the way in which services and supports for people with disabilities are delivered in moving away from institutional models of care and service delivery to community-based, person-centred models of service.

The HSE has prioritised the transition of 170 people from congregated settings in 2018 under its Service Plan.  The HSE has established a subgroup, under the Value for Money Steering Group, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions that will be rolled out at a regional and local level, in full consultation with residents and their families. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care for individuals will be based on a person-centred plan (PCP).

It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. The new scheme will also be designed to support family\/unpaid carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social-care services such as long-term residential care (including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme), primary and community services and hospital services. <\/p>  <p>  As an initial step in the development of the new scheme, the Department of Health commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home-care systems in place in four European countries. The review, which was published last April, will help to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s new home-care scheme and system of regulation is informed by international experience. In addition a public consultation on the financing and regulation of home-care was undertaken last year. The purpose of this consultation, to which approximately 2,600 submissions were received, was to enable the Department to find out about the views of service-users, their families and healthcare workers on current and future home-care provision. A report on the findings of the consultation was published on 26   June and will inform the development of the new scheme. Further consultation with service-users will take place later this year, in addition to which the Department is actively engaging with the key NGOs and representative groups. <\/p>  <p>  The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-care services is a complex undertaking. While the publication of the HRB review and of the report on the findings of the public consultation represent important milestones in the process of developing the new scheme, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of the home-care scheme and system of regulation. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. The Department will continue to prioritise its work in developing the new scheme and every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible. However a realistic timeframe for the establishment of the new scheme on a statutory basis is 2&ndash;3 years.<\/p>  <p>  While the new home-care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive are continuing efforts to improve existing home-care services. In 2018 the HSE brought the funding for home help and Home Care Packages together into a single home support service for older people. As well as simplifying the application-process for home-care, the new service will be more responsive to service-users' changing needs. More broadly the HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and to build appropriate care-pathways, in particular for people with complex needs. A consumer-directed approach to home-support provision will be introduced, giving service-users greater choice in relation to when they receive services and their selection of a service-provider. This enhancement of current service-provision is being supported by increased investment in home-care services. In line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government (2016) to increase funding for home-care annually, funding for Older Persons&rsquo; Services rose from &euro;763m in 2017 to &euro;811m in 2018, including approximately &euro;417m for the provision of home-support services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Data","counter":1297,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1298,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[30278\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the availability of ambulances in the greater Dublin area; the average response times for ambulances following receipt of a 999 call; the number of instances in which an ambulance has not been immediately dispatched following receipt of an emergency call; the action he is taking to ensure adequate ambulance resources are in place and to ensure emergency calls can be responded to in a fast and efficient manner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1299,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":1300,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1301,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[30283\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the mental health supports available for children awaiting scoliosis surgery here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1302,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"question","counter":1304,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[30284\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the mental health supports available for young persons that have a physical disability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1305,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade in Tobacco","counter":1306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1307,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[30286\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000091#WRDD01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the next national steps to be taken with respect to the WHO protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products in view of the fact that the conditions for the entry into force of the instrument adopted under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control were met on 27 June 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1308,"content":"<p>Ireland is applying the standard approach to the ratification of international agreements to the Protocol on the Illicit Trade of Tobacco in that it is seeking to ensure that all the necessary domestic legislation and amendments to legislation have been identified and effected before it proceeds to ratification.

Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Furthermore, the National Development Plan, published earlier this year as part of the Ireland 2040 policy initiative, acknowledges the need for additional capacity requirements and it is expected that 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds will be required across the public system in Community Nursing Units and other step-down facilities, as identified by the Health Capacity Review.<\/p>  <p>  Under the NDP, health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue -  including the Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units.  These major priority projects and programmes will require the bulk of the notified capital allocation over the initial period of the Plan, 2018-2022.  It is important to recognise that the NDP is a long-term plan, which will roll out over ten years and includes provision for a large number of developments across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Mental Health and Older People Jim Daly TD is aware of local concerns that have been raised relating to the future of long-stay residential care provision in the East Donegal area.

The policy will apply across the wide spectrum of the health sector, i.e. in the public, private and voluntary sectors, and will be supported by any necessary legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  A detailed review of the operation of the HSE&rsquo;s operational safeguarding policy is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed soon.  The findings of the HSE&rsquo;s safeguarding review will assist the Department of Health&rsquo;s development of appropriate policy approaches for the wider health sector.  <\/p>  <p>  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are currently in the process of jointly developing National Standards for Adult Safeguarding, with advisory input from the Department of Health among others.  <\/p>  <p>  Together these initiatives should greatly improve the safeguarding of adults at risk of abuse and neglect in the health sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000096#WRJJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":1518,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000096#WRJJ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1519,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[30700\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000096#WRJJ01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of CBT assistance for a person (details supplied);

Funding is available towards the establishment of new neighbourwoods on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites, the silvicultural enhancement of existing woodland already used as neighbourwoods (or proposed for development as neighbourwoods), and the installation and upgrade of appropriate recreational facilities within certain areas.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These neighbourwoods vary greatly in size and location, from forests in the countryside and on the outskirts of villages, towns and cities, to woodlands located in more built-up areas.

Neighbourwoods provide accessible opportunities for recreation and regular exercise, and offer people &lsquo;time-out&rsquo; and contact with the natural world and the changing seasons.

It\u00a0will ultimately simplify the sheep tagging system and will significantly reduce the record keeping requirements for farmers and producers alike.  The extension of EID to all sheep has the capacity to allow for greater market access to third countries, including the USA, as well as considering the potential of sheepmeat access to Japan and other markets.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The current national sheep identification system\u00a0(NSIS)\u00a0was introduced\u00a0in 2010 in an effort to address specific concerns across different sectors.  It is widely acknowledged as being\u00a0very complex, with an over-reliance on the transcription of individual numbers\u00a0through all stages of production.\u00a0The system\u00a0is not functioning optimally and must be improved.<\/p>  <p>  Acknowledging that the new sheep identification rules will impose an additional cost on farmers,\u00a0I have announced a tag subsidy scheme, whereby keepers will be eligible for a payment of up to &euro;50 on the first electronic tag order processed after a date to be specified.  In addition, while not required for the implementation of the new rules, I have\u00a0included sheep tag readers and associated software as eligible investments under the TAMS Scheme.  This will greatly assist keepers in their on-going\u00a0flock management and improvement.  TAMS is a scheme that farmers are familiar with and which also offers other sheep-related investment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0operational terms, when the new system comes into force, marts and factories will operate as Central Points of Recording (CPRs), approved by my Department.  As provided for under Council Regulation 21\/2004, CPRs will provide the presenting keeper with a printed list of tag numbers scanned in association with a particular batch of sheep presented at a mart or factory, thereby removing the requirement for the keeper to\u00a0separately list the individual tag number of each animal in that batch.  The printed list\u00a0will then be associated with the related dispatch document for the keeper's records.  In the case of mart movements, the CPR will\u00a0provide a similar printout to the purchasing keeper, for association with his\/her records.<\/p>  <p>  Only movements to premises that are not operating as approved CPRs (e.g. farm-to-farm, farm-show etc.) will require the listing of full animal identification numbers on the associated dispatch document.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of marts and factories as CPRs\u00a0means that no farmer will be required to purchase tag reading equipment, although this is an option for those who wish to record and monitor animal data\u00a0with a view to\u00a0improving flock management and optimising yield.<\/p>  <p>  I have\u00a0led a number of trade missions in the last number of years, where every\u00a0effort is\u00a0being\u00a0made by organisations throughout the country\u00a0to secure additional\u00a0markets for Irish sheep meat.  Increasingly,\u00a0these new markets require the\u00a0electronic identification of sheep as a pre-requisite to discussions.  While it is the case that\u00a0New Zealand has access to Asian markets in the absence of electronic identification, as alluded to in\u00a0the\u00a0supplied detail, these are historic markets, where\u00a0access was granted many years ago when technology had not advanced to the standards of today.  New, higher\u00a0standards are now required for entry into these markets and Ireland has no choice but to reach the standards set out if we are to expand our market base into these countries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the introduction of EID in sheep,\u00a0either myself\u00a0or my officials have met with the stakeholders in the sheep industry\u00a0and engaged in consultation on the implementation of EID.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A number of submissions have also been made\u00a0on the matter of implementation of EID and\u00a0I will consider the views\u00a0of all stakeholders\u00a0and expect to respond soon on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000102#WRPP03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":1812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000102#WRPP03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1813,"qnumday":731,"qnumall":"[30503\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000102#WRPP03800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the cost of travel expenses for him and those who travel with him since his appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1814,"content":"<p>The relevant information can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at https:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.ie\/aboutus\/ministers\/. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000102#WRPP03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Veterinary Practice","counter":1815,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000102#WRPP04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1816,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[30522\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000102#WRPP04100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a regulatory vacuum has been allowed to exist in the context of the decision by the Veterinary Council of Ireland, made in January 2018, to deregulate on a unilateral basis the ownership of veterinary practices here (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1817,"content":"<p>The regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine in accordance with the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 is a matter for the Veterinary Council\u00a0of Ireland (VCI).<\/p><p>My Department has\u00a0communicated with\u00a0the VCI\u00a0in relation to\u00a0the ownership of veterinary practices.

For example, being present at one of the World&rsquo;s largest food trade exhibitions in Shanghai\u00a0allowed me to reinforce the positive messages about the quality and sustainability of Irish agrifood exports\u00a0to Asian buyers. \u00a0I\u00a0also met with\u00a0three senior Chinese Ministers and three Vice-Ministers over the course of the week. The value of\u00a0our agrifood exports to China in 2017 reached just under &euro;800 million.\u00a0There is a clear ambition on both sides to further build co-operation between Ireland and China on many levels, including trade, and I will continue to do all I can to maximise this potential.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the latter half of 2018 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access\u00a0in these destinations.\u00a0\u00a0They will also help to promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. <\/p>  <p>  The destinations are also in keeping with the market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia in December 2017, at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers as we continue to navigate the very uncertain environment created by Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Indian market is traditionally seen as a difficult market for Irish food and drinks exports to penetrate, due to restrictions in quotas, high tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\u00a0 However, I am pleased to note that Irish exports have increased in recent years.

Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group which I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.<\/p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The sixth meeting of the Taskforce Implementation Group was held on 4 July 2018, and the Quarter 2 2018 Progress Report has since been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This report offers progress updates on all Q2 actions.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage black-spots, various initiatives are under way:<\/p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for deployment of telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.<\/p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local black-spots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local black-spots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is on-going under the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this.<\/p>  <p>  - A review was conducted to identify recommendations to address black-spots. A focus group is continuing this work in 2018, to inform future policy development and initiatives. The work of this focus group, will provide guidance on location categories where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg recently introduced a new scheme allowing the use of accredited mobile phone repeaters to help address the issue of indoor coverage, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg is also developing a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and awareness raising activities, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.<\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas such as West Wicklow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000104#WRRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":1883,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000104#WRRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1884,"qnumday":754,"qnumall":"[30481\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000104#WRRR01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the implementation of the public sector energy efficiency action plan.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1885,"content":"<p>Ireland has a national target to improve energy efficiency by 20% by 2020.  The public sector has a critical leadership role to play, with a more ambitious 33% energy efficiency target in the same period.  Very significant efficiency gains have already been made with a 20% improvement in energy efficiency achieved in the public sector by the end of 2016.  This equates to &euro;133m of energy spend savings and a 520,000 tonne CO2 equivalent savings mitigated by the public sector in 2016 alone. This is set out in the <i>Annual Report on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance <\/i>compiled by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), and available on their website.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, a significant scaling up of effort is now required if the 33% is to be met. This is why I published the first Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy, with the approval of Government, in January 2017.  It introduced new governance structures and enhanced support measures, and provided clarity on the retention of financial savings achieved by public sector bodies from the energy efficiency measures they implement.  <\/p><p>To realise the potential for energy efficiency in the public sector, there must be senior leadership and accountability for energy performance in Government Departments and public sector bodies.  All Government Departments have now appointed Energy Performance Officers (EPO) at a senior level to provide the necessary strategic leadership to their departments and bodies in their sectors on energy management. <\/p><p>Since the publication of the Strategy, my Department, along with the SEAI and OPW, have continued to engage with the EPO network and their energy management teams through workshops and individual advisory sessions. This engagement process is then supported on an on-going basis by the specialist energy advisors assigned to each Department by SEAI. The next step is for my Department, again working with SEAI and OPW, to support EPO's to work with the bodies in their sector to identify and develop energy efficiency projects, and avail of the financial and advisory supports, funded by my Department and available from SEAI.  <\/p><p>In 2017, I secured &euro;5m for two pilot partnership programmes between the SEAI and the OPW, and SEAI and Department of Education and Skills.  &euro;3 million was allocated to the SEAI\/OPW pilot to deliver energy upgrades in central government buildings and &euro;2 million was allocated for a SEAI\/DES pilot for medium to deep retrofit upgrades to 10 primary and secondary schools.  The purpose of these pilot programmes was to develop a scalable model for energy retrofit investment in our central government building stock and school. I have secured a further &euro;9m this year to extend those pilot initiatives and to further invest in energy efficiency projects and initiatives in the wider public sector.  The progress gained and learnings from last year are currently informing the development of standard retrofit approaches that will be effectively and efficiently deployed throughout the entire public sector building stock.  <\/p><p>A project pipeline is currently being developed to identify projects of significant scale that can close the remaining gap to target.  Along with the pilot schemes, the SEAI is working with the higher education, State laboratory  and healthcare sectors to develop significant projects and continues, along with my Department, to support the City &amp;amp; County Management Association in its development of its National Public Lighting upgrade programme, which will halve local authority electricity use.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Strategy is now providing the basis for realising the commitment in the National Development Plan, to upgrade the public sector built environment under a comprehensive &euro;750 million retrofit programme.  This will place the public sector built environment on a sound trajectory for 2050 and lead the way in developing Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable energy supply chain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000104#WRRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":1886,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000104#WRRR01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1887,"qnumday":755,"qnumall":"[30482\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000104#WRRR01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the implementation of the national broadband plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1888,"content":"<p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.

Therefore, the National Energy Forum will be a part of the National Dialogue.<\/p><p>The primary objective of the National Dialogue will be to ensure an inclusive process of engagement and consensus building across society towards enabling the transformation to a low carbon and climate-resilient future. To do this, the Dialogue will seek to create awareness, engagement and motivation to act (locally, regionally and nationally) in relation to the challenges presented by climate change and to establish, on a long term basis, appropriate networks for people to meet periodically to consider evidence-based inputs on the economic, social, behavioural, environmental and public aspects of climate and energy policy.

Better Energy Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty.

It is a certificate based scheme with two certificates awarded per litre of sustainable biofuel if that biofuel is produced from wastes or residues and one certificate per litre for all other sustainable biofuels. The Biofuels Obligation Scheme is administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency, which is a body established under the 2007 National Oil Reserves Agency Act.<\/p>  <p>  For each calendar year, a fuel supplier must hold sufficient biofuel obligation certificates to demonstrate compliance.  The number of certificates required is determined by the biofuel obligation rate, which is currently set at 8%.  This means that at the end of 2018, a fuel supplier must hold 8 biofuel certificates for every 92 litres of fossil fuel they place on the road transport fuel market this year.  If a fuel supplier does not have sufficient certificates, it can purchase certificates from other obligated parties who hold surpluses and\/or pay a &lsquo;buy out charge&rsquo; of 45 cent per certificate for the shortfall. The level of compliance with the obligation is high and there has been very limited necessity for the buy-out charge to be levied since the scheme was introduced.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 the Biofuels Obligation Scheme resulted in over 225 million litres of biofuel being placed on the market in Ireland leading to over 7% renewable energy use in the transport sector compared to the 10% target for 2020 under the Renewable Energy Directive.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2017, my Department held a consultation seeking views in relation to implementing a phased increase to the biofuel obligation rate and on how the scheme could be developed in the future. A key theme to emerge from responses to the consultation was the need to provide certainty to industry and stakeholders to facilitate longer term planning for future blending obligations. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, I published a Biofuel Obligation Scheme Policy Statement which set out six key actions that will be undertaken in the development of the scheme. This included an increase in the biofuel obligation rate to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019 and 11% by volume from 1 January 2020. The first of these changes has been enacted by S.I.

The low emission vehicle task force is bringing forward proposals in this regard.<\/p><p>As regards significant regulatory change, the National Development Plan commits the Government to no new non-zero emission cars to be sold in Ireland post-2030, with no NCT certificates to be issued for non-zero emission cars post-2045. There is also to be a transition to a low emission urban bus\u00a0fleet, including electric buses, with no diesel only buses purchased from 1 July 2019.<\/p><p>Given the significant role for my Department in the development and implementation of policies and programmes envisaged in the National Development Plan to advance our transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society, as well as other programmes for which I am responsible,\u00a0I am in constant\u00a0contact with\u00a0my officials regarding the implementation of various elements of the Project Ireland 2040 commitments and I also meet with the Management Board of the Department each month to review progress on the full suite of business priorities for which the Department is responsible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000105#WRSS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Requests","counter":1944,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000105#WRSS02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1945,"qnumday":774,"qnumall":"[30564\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000105#WRSS02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of FOI requests his Department has received since January 2018; the number of refusals; the number that have been appealed and that are ongoing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1946,"content":"<p>Details of the FOI requests received by my Department in the period 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2018, as requested by the Deputy is set out in the Table below.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Total no. of requests received <\/th><th>No. of requests dealt with outside of the FOI process<\/th><th>No. of requests processed<br \/><br \/><\/th><th>No. of requests refused <\/th><th>No. of appeals <\/th><th>No. of requests that are ongoing<br \/><br \/><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>164<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>113 <\/td><td>32<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>34<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The basis for the refusal of the 32 FOI requests in the relevant period is as follows: <\/p><p>Section 15 -Records do not exist (19 cases)<\/p><p>Section 33- Matters relating to the defence or security of the State (5 cases)<\/p><p>Sections 29 &amp;amp; 30 &ndash; Deliberative process of FOI Bodies (4 cases)<\/p><p>Section 15 - Information already in the public domain ( 2 cases)<\/p><p>Section 42 -\u00a0 Record relating to private papers of a member of the Oireachtas \u00a0(1 case)<\/p><p>Section 28 -\u00a0 Meetings of Government (1 case)<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000105#WRSS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacancies on State Boards","counter":1947,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000105#WRSS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1948,"qnumday":775,"qnumall":"[30581\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000105#WRSS02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of vacancies on State boards under the remit of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1949,"content":"<p>The table below outlines the vacancies on the State boards under the remit of my Department as at 30 June 2018.

The reduction will require a significant increase in the share of renewables in primary energy supply. The government has made a definitive decision to take coal out of power generation by 2025 and peat out before 2030.

For each sector, the Plan sets out the sectorial policy context, the greenhouse gas emissions trends for each sector, the opportunities and challenges, mitigation measures currently in place and under development, and specific actions to take forward work within each sector. The National Development Plan specifies that &euro;1 in every &euro;5 spent over the next decade in public funding is to be spent on climate &ndash;related activity.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Work is also being carried out to examine the potential economic impact of various carbon tax scenarios.

This covers a wide range of roles, including regulatory enforcement, undertaking inspections and taking appropriate measures to bring relevant parties into compliance, addressing unauthorised waste activities and responding to environmental complaints.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for each individual local authority in the first instance to deal with any instances of illegal disposal of waste in their area and to take the appropriate enforcement action. Local authorities have significant powers available to them under the Waste Management Act, to enable them to tackle illegal waste activity. This includes the power to investigate complaints, prosecute offences, apply to the Courts for the imposition of fines, enter onto and inspect premises where there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is a risk of environmental pollution, direct a holder of waste to dispose of it in a certain way within a specific timeframe and monitor and inspect waste holding, recovery and disposal facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are assisted by three Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs), covering the Southern, Eastern and Midlands, and\u00a0Connacht\/Ulster Regions, which were established in 2015. The WERLA offices have responsibility for coordinating waste enforcement actions within regions, setting priorities and common objectives for waste enforcement, ensuring consistent enforcement of waste legislation while still leaving local authority personnel as first responders on the ground. The work of the WERLAs is overseen by a National Steering Committee which includes representatives from a wide range of regulatory and law enforcement authorities. <\/p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency carries out its waste enforcement functions through the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE), and the Office of Climate, Licensing, Resource and Research (OCLRR). The OEE has a mandate to deliver enhanced environmental compliance through enforcement of EPA licences issued to waste, industrial and other activities.\u00a0 It also exercises a supervisory role in respect of the environmental protection activities of local authorities.\u00a0 In this regard, the OEE acts as a resource to members of the public who have exhausted all other avenues of complaint. Further enforcement responsibility is assigned to the OCLRR, including producer responsibility enforcement related to WEEE, batteries and tyres.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transfrontier Waste Shipment (TFS) Office was established in 2007 as part of Ireland&rsquo;s transposition of Regulation (EC) No. 1013\/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the waste shipment regulation). All transfrontier shipments of waste originating in any local authority area in the State that are subject to prior written notification procedures must be notified to and through the National TFS Office who have a dedicated enforcement team in place to tackle the illegal shipment of waste abroad.<\/p>  <p>  The National Waste Collection Permit Office processes waste collection permit applications and review applications for all local authorities. It maintains the Waste Collection Permit register, revokes Waste Collection Permits as appropriate, and provides data reports to relevant stakeholders- including enforcement authorities \u00a0where required.<\/p>  <p>  My commitment to supporting waste enforcement activities is demonstrated through continued investment in the network of local authority waste enforcement officers, increased resources for the EPA and the development of the WERLA Offices.

A second document &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo; was published by NTA\u00a0last week. <\/p><p>This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex and is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes. Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit the full potential of these investments. Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking. <\/p><p>The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals and grow suburban feeder networks. While there will be concerns with any change, these strategies will deliver the following benefits<b><\/b>for the customer; much simpler city services; much simpler fare structure; provide more frequent all day services through new and frequent strong orbital services interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines. <\/p><p>Full public consultation on the network redesign proposals, involving Dublin Bus, using local brochures, local face to face events, digital imaging of the network, on-line surveys and consultation with user groups will commence from the 16<sup>th<\/sup>July. NTA will launch a full public consultation process\u00a0on the proposed core bus corridors later this year. <\/p><p>More information on estimated costs will be available as the various strands of the programme are progressed.<\/p><p>The Network Direct programme\u00a0 to which the Deputy refers, launched by Dublin Bus in 2010 and completed in 2013, delivered an increase in the number of high frequency routes; greater use of Quality Bus Corridors (QBC); less route variations making the network easier to understand; a\u00a0new network of more direct orbital services; an increase in cross city routes to minimise customer interchange; and improved connections with Rail and Luas transport modes.

Through its Educational Welfare Service, the Agency responds to instances where children, including children from the Traveller community, are not attending school regularly, leading to concerns for their educational welfare. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the Department of Education policy in relation to Traveller Education is informed by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was launched in 2006 following wide ranging consultation with Traveller representative groups and other relevant stakeholders. The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy. The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of an inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation. In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system for children are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need. This includes Traveller children who require additional resources based on need and not on their identity as Travellers. Segregated Traveller specific programmes such as the Visiting Teacher for Travellers were phased out in line with the principle of inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  School attendance is one of the critical building blocks of positive educational outcomes.\u00a0 While educational outcomes for Traveller children continue to improve, in most areas attendance still falls well behind the national average and we are aware that there are still areas where attendance and participation among Traveller children is not improving consistently. Following the launch of the 2017 National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy,\u00a0my Department is committed to working with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Justice and Equality, Tusla Educational Welfare Services and Traveller and Roma representative groups to examine ways in which Traveller children&rsquo;s attendance and participation may be further enhanced especially in areas where attendance is of greatest concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000108#WRVV03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Adoptions","counter":2111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000108#WRVV03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2112,"qnumday":831,"qnumall":"[30385\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000108#WRVV03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the mechanisms that will be put in place or that are already in place to assist a person who was illegally adopted via St. Patrick's, Navan Road, to trace their birth family; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2113,"content":"<p>On foot of the recent discovery by Tusla of 126 cases of illegal registrations I moved immediately to inform the Cabinet.\u00a0I also announced that a process has been put in place by Tusla to manage these cases.\u00a0This is being led by experienced information and tracing social workers.<\/p>  <p>  As an immediate step Tusla put in place a Helpline which is operating from 10am to 4 pm Monday to Friday.\u00a0Tusla has also put\u00a0relevant information on its website.<\/p>  <p>  Each of the 126 cases has been assigned to a social worker and work has commenced on tracing the people concerned.\u00a0These include the person who was illegally registered as a child, the birth mother and the people who participated in the illegal registration and subsequently raised these children as their own.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of the files containing information are more than 50 years old.

This measure refines the development previously introduced, whereby three intake dates were adopted (September, January and April), and will increase the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years).  This further enhancement delivers on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a second year of ECCE required either an increase in the upper age limit for ECCE, or a reduction in the lower age limit.  The latter was chosen and is consistent with the law in this country with regard to school start age and the associated policy of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  This minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice.  It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and\u00a0adult-child ratios.  The upper age limit will remain the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).<\/p>  <p>  This new measure will address the previous situation with regard to three entry points whereby there was a\u00a0broad fluctuation\u00a0in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash;(between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child) &ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children.  As with any large scheme at national level, clear rules are required to ensure transparency and objectivity in administration.  It is a feature however of such schemes that where cut off points relate to age, some applicants benefit\u00a0more than others. <\/p>  <p>  The number of entry points will revert to one at the beginning of September 2018.  One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year.  This will also make it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.<\/p>  <p>  A child will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2018 if they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2018.\u00a0 Their ECCE eligibility\u00a0commences in 2019, and will\u00a0continue for a further year from September 2020 until June 2021. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It must be noted that parents have the discretion to decide how much of ECCE to avail of for their child.  A decision may be made to\u00a0utilise\u00a0only one year of the programme\u00a0for various reasons.\u00a0 For example, some parents of children born in the first quarter of the year, as outlined by the Deputy, may prefer for their child to start school at 4 years of age\u00a0rather than 5.  These parents may therefore opt for 1 year of ECCE only. <\/p>  <p>  The entry and exit points for ECCE for children with disabilities is currently being reviewed.  The National Disability Authority has conducted some\u00a0research on the matter and has led a national consultation process with parents and providers.  It\u00a0is due to report shortly.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills continue to work together to ensure that early years and school age education policies are consistent and meet the best interest of children.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of childcare costs, it\u00a0should be noted that parents\u00a0of children aged from 6 months to the age of eligibility for ECCE can avail of the\u00a0new universal subsidy of up to &euro;1040 per year, introduced in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000109#WRWW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":2147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000109#WRWW02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Constitutional Amendments","counter":2146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000109#WRWW01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2147,"qnumday":843,"qnumall":"[30106\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000109#WRWW02000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if his Department has identified laws which are dependent on or in place as a consequence of Article 41.2 of the Constitution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1310","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":2148,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department\u00a0has no legislation or legislation to be enacted which\u00a0is dependent on or in place as a consequence of Article 41.2 of the Constitution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000109#WRWW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Recreation Scheme","counter":2149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000109#WRWW02200"},{"type":"question","counter":2150,"qnumday":844,"qnumall":"[30137\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000109#WRWW02300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the amount of funding that was issued to groups in County Kildare under the rural recreation, infrastructure and the town and village renewal schemes in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018; the groups that drew down funding; the nature of the projects they requested funding for under each grant heading; the amount available overall under the headings in each of the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":2151,"content":"<p>The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure scheme (previously known as the Rural Recreation Scheme) provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure and for the maintenance and promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>&euro;7.4 million was allocated to\u00a0117 projects nationally under the scheme in 2016 and a total of &euro;13.6 million was allocated to 251 projects under the 2017 scheme. <\/p><p>Only one application was submitted\u00a0in respect of Co.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to more than 631,000 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Based on Department of Education and Skills figures on the numbers of 18 and 19 year olds in full-time secondary education in 2017, the estimated annual cost of extending the upper age limit to include 18 and 19 year olds in full-time secondary education alone is in the region of &euro;65 million.

Therefore, in a self-employed person&rsquo;s initial year of assessment of having an insurance liability, on payment of the due amount, the person will be recorded as having paid 52 weekly contributions for that year.<\/p><p>Where the self-employed discharge their combined Income Tax, USC and PRSI liability through Revenue&rsquo;s self-assessed system of collection, a single payment is made in respect of their combined liability for all complete tax years up to and including the year in which the self-employed worker reaches their 65th year. <\/p><p>As Revenue does not have the facility to collect a part of a year&rsquo;s PRSI liability in respect of the individual&rsquo;s 66th year, payment can be facilitated by the Department&rsquo;s Client Eligibility Services, Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, Government Buildings, Cork Road, Waterford. <\/p><p>Such additional (66th year) S Class contributions may be used, where necessary, to satisfy the &lsquo;minimum 520 paid contributions&rsquo; condition for State pension (contributory) eligibility, but cannot be used in the yearly-averaging assessment of pension rate entitlement, for which the cut-off point in totalling contributions is the end date of the immediately preceding (full) tax year.  This is exactly the same &lsquo;66th year&rsquo; approach that is facilitated in the case of standard employees (rather than self-employed) who may require some additional contributions to satisfy the &ldquo;520 contribution&rdquo; condition<b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000110#WRXX05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Administration","counter":2230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2231,"qnumday":871,"qnumall":"[30480\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding pension schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2232,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding.

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle. Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time and  he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.<\/p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit at half-rate at the same time.  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  However, the social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.<\/p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, and Widows and Widowers Pensions was discontinued from January 2012, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients. There are exceptions to this as in a case where a reduced Widows Pension is in payment and paid at a rate lower than the Illness Benefit Rate. In such circumstances Illness Benefit may be paid to ensure that the aggregate payment will equate with the maximum rate of Illness Benefit appropriate to the person&rsquo;s circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  To change the underlying principle of entitlement to only one payment at any one time could involve significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long-term and it is not intended to depart from this principle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":2236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2237,"qnumday":873,"qnumall":"[30510\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the cost of travel expenses for her and those that travel with her since her appointment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2238,"content":"<p>The cost of domestic and foreign travel expenses claimed by myself, my Private Secretary and my Advisers and the cost of foreign travel expenses claimed by civil servants who travelled with me since I became Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection in June 2017 is &euro;49,517.30. <\/p>  <p>  Due to the procedures in place in my Department for claiming travel costs and the number of staff employed in my Department it has not been possible to separate out on an individual basis the domestic travel costs that relate specifically to official travel with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Project Ireland 2040","counter":2239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2240,"qnumday":874,"qnumall":"[30551\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000111#WRYY01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of times she has met her officials regarding Project Ireland 2040 since its launch; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2241,"content":"<p>The key overarching objective included in Project Ireland 2040 which relates to my Department is to bring unemployment rates in all regions down to within 1% of the national average.  <\/p>  <p>  In the shorter term, the National Development Plan 2018 to 2027 includes two projects that come under my Department's remit.

The report found that the changes made to the one-parent family payment scheme in 2012 increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills needs to be seen as a key objective, as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The review additionally highlighted a number of areas of concern: many of those who lost OFP remain unemployed, or are in low paid or part-time employment.  The balance of evidence indicates that there is an increased probability of being at risk of poverty as a result of the changes.  Further supports, aimed at assisting lone parents to obtain full-time employment or increased hours of work, need to be put in place.<\/p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with Budget measures over recent years introduced as the economy began to work its way out of recession, are likely to have impacted positively on poverty rates since 2016 (the most recent available data) and since the period examined in the Indecon report.  This improvement is expected to continue over the coming years.  My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of Budgets 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are an indicator of this improvement.  These show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents (and &euro;33.60 for unemployed lone parents).  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;34.45 for the average household (given the impact of two-adult families on the average household figure).<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 measures that took effect from 29th March this year (specifically the increases to the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for a qualified child) will assist a lone parent in receipt of the one-parent family payment or jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage, to be better off by almost &euro;1,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  We know that social transfers are very effective in reducing poverty and that Eurostat data shows that Ireland performs well in this regard.  But we also know that reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2016 shows that being at work reduces the consistent poverty rate for lone parents by nearly two-thirds, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.<\/p>  <p>  Our focus therefore, through the activation service provided by my Department, is on supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and, at a cross-governmental level on assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000112#WRZZ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment","counter":2304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000112#WRZZ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2305,"qnumday":894,"qnumall":"[30841\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000112#WRZZ02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"to outline the supports in place to assist lone parents returning to education and returning to work.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2306,"content":"<p>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, offers a wide range of financial supports to lone parents that allow them to participate in a variety of educational and employment programmes.<\/p><p>For example, lone parents in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) or Jobseekers Transitional payment (JST) who wish to participate in <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">second or third-level<\/font>education can opt to retain their current payment and also avail of the SUSI maintenance grant from the Department of Education and Skills.

The Group produced a number of reports over the 2011-2013 period, and made proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.<\/p><p>- In 2017 as part of the initial process of developing the Working Family Payment (WFP), the Department carried out an extensive analysis of the range of supports it provides, including the Working Family Payment, to assist individuals to take up and remain in employment.  This analysis showed that existing in-work supports are very effective and work well in assisting individuals to make the transition from unemployment into employment.<\/p><p>- Finally, the Social Welfare Act 2017 provides for a review of the operation of the Working Family Payment, including the requirement to work at least 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight, to be submitted to the Social Protection Committee.<\/p><p>WFP Developments 1984 &ndash; to date<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Development<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1984<\/td><td>Scheme introduced to provide income support for employees on low earnings with children.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1986<\/td><td>Reduction in the minimum number of hours worked per week from 30 to 24.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1989<\/td><td>An increase in the multiplier from 50% to 60% of the gap between actual income and ceiling.

The funding is designed to leverage a greater proportion of residential and commercial development, supported by infrastructure, services and amenities, within the existing built-up areas of our larger urban settlements.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for implementing the URDF, which has an allocation of &euro;2 billion over the 10-year period of the National Development Plan (NDP) to 2027, with &euro;100 million available for expenditure in 2019 and an overall allocation of &euro;550 million earmarked for the Fund up to the end of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  On 3rd July, I announced the first call for proposals under the URDF.  The application process will run until end-September 2018.  The Fund will operate on a competitive, bid-based Exchequer grant basis, with proposals being required to demonstrate that they will be: <\/p>  <p>  -  Innovative and transformational urban regeneration projects;<\/p>  <p>  -  Public-sector led and with the option of community and\/or private sector partners; <\/p>  <p>  -  Matched by at least 25% direct funding from other public and\/or private sources;<\/p>  <p>  -  A minimum bid of &euro;2m;<\/p>  <p>  -  A catalyst for development that would not otherwise occur; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Likely to leverage significant further public and private sector investment.<\/p>  <p>  This Fund has enormous potential to deliver more affordable homes as part of the redevelopment and revitalisation of urban core areas,  and my Department would welcome proposals addressing measures to improve housing affordability, in addition to a range of proposal types in the context of urban regeneration and development. I would urge eligible public sector organisations to avail of the opportunity through collaboration and making best use of the skills and talent available to design creative and innovative proposals.  <\/p>  <p>  The information seminar which my Department organised yesterday, 9 July 2018, and which I attended, was aimed at providing some policy context and more detailed guidance  on the Fund for potential lead partners from Local Authorities, Regional Assemblies and Government Departments and to provide clarity on any queries arising, to ensure that we can maximise the potential of the available funding to help meet the National Strategic Objectives set down in the NPF, both in 2019 and over subsequent years.  I am greatly encouraged by the level of engagement and interest of all who attended and I look forward to seeing funding applications for proposals that are innovative, ambitious and collaborative and that are capable to delivering on the key objectives.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will monitor the process in relation to the Fund and will consider the issue of further guidance in light of the level of queries that may emerge throughout the application period.

While the inclusion of gulls in the derogation was limited to the Balbriggan area only for a limited trial period and does not involve the actual culling of gulls, I will take full account of the consultants' views in the context of future derogations and following consideration of the consultants final report, a draft of which has been sent to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has received representations from the local community group referred to in relation to the interim report.
