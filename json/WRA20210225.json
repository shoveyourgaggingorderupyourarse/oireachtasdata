This scheme ended on 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). <\/p>  <p>  The transitional phase of TWSS operated until 3 May 2020 and provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees. The operational phase of the scheme was introduced from 4 May 2020 and included increased subsidy rates up to 85%, to a maximum subsidy payment of &euro;410. The operational phases also included a tapering mechanism that ensured the subsidy payment plus any additional payment by the employer did not exceed the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;normal&rsquo; average weekly wage (ARNWP).  This ARNWP, was calculated using the pay and tax details as reported to Revenue in the employer&rsquo;s payroll submission for each pay date in January and February 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Under the TWSS, the employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain employees&rsquo; net income for the duration of the scheme. However, there was no legal requirement for an employer to pay an additional gross (top-up) payment that fully or partially made up the difference between the amount provided by the subsidy scheme and the employee&rsquo;s normal wage (ARNWP). The TWSS legislation also required employers to separately identify subsidy payments on employee payslips from any top-up payments made.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that based on payroll submissions received from the person&rsquo;s employer, her ARNWP was calculated at &euro;721.00 per week and the maximum subsidy payable to her under the TWSS was &euro;350.00 per week. According to Revenue records, the person received TWSS payments from 9 April 2020 to 27 August 2020, which were in accordance with her ARNWP and which took account of the various additional top-up payments received from her employer during this time. <\/p>  <p>  However, Revenue has previously publicly stated that for certain employees where their employer paid net weekly earnings of between &euro;586 and &euro;960 pre-COVID, the full amount of the subsidy due to such employees may not have been paid through the payroll process during the period the TWSS was in operation.  The process of identifying those employees who qualify for an additional subsidy is currently in progress.  Revenue intends to offset any additional amount against an individual&rsquo;s outstanding income tax\/Universal Social Charge (USC) due for 2020, or by way of direct refund if the person has no 2020 arrears.  Based on the information available, it would appear that the person concerned may meet the relevant criteria and may be due an additional wage subsidy.  It is hoped that this process will be implemented by the middle of this year when all the relevant data from employers has been reconciled and the required IT systems developments have been completed.  It is not possible to quantify at this point how much additional subsidy amount each person would be entitled to.<\/p>  <p>  As already indicated, the EWSS replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020. The scheme is an economy-wide enterprise support that operates differently to the TWSS in that it provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers (rather than employees) based on the numbers of eligible employees on the payroll and on the level of weekly gross pay to those employees. The qualifying criteria for subsidy payments require that the employer pays gross weekly wages to the eligible employee of between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462. There is no subsidy payable where the gross weekly wage is less than &euro;151.50 or more than &euro;1,462. The rates of subsidy payable to employers per employee are &euro;350, &euro;300, &euro;250 and &euro;203, based on the level of gross wages paid. The level of gross wages paid is a matter for the employer and employee to agree. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that taxpayer confidentiality prohibits the disclosure of any information regarding the specific employer&rsquo;s operation of the EWSS.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500053#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500053#WRB04900"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[10610\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500053#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that insurance companies are charging double excess on claims, a policy excess and a voluntary excess, without informing customers in advance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to motor insurance.

Where a loan is sold or transferred to another regulated entity, the protections that were available to borrowers prior to the transaction continue to be in place with the new owner.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated by international standards, with five retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending, and three retail banks accounting for the majority of new bank lending to SMEs. However, the wider context is one of improving competition in the provision of financial services, with new non-bank entities entering or expanding their operations in SME lending, including through loan guarantee schemes such as the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.  Indecon&rsquo;s report also noted that there is extensive provision of and access to banking services through bank branches, credit union offices and An Post branches across the country, as well as a wide range of Exchequer funded existing supports.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the provision of financial services is evolving rapidly.  These range from innovations in fintech to new initiatives from credit unions and the likes of An Post that are resulting in the provision of new services and products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500053#WRB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500053#WRB05500"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[10647\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500053#WRB05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the recent engagement his Department has had with the three credit union representative bodies (details supplied) regarding the provision of SME lending and ensure the productive use of credit union members savings that are at present on deposit in the major retail banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>I met all of the representative bodies you refer to in September 2020, the third such meeting during 2020.

PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP are provided for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). <\/p>  <p>  For 2021, the mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, including Jobseekers&rsquo; Benefit and Illness Benefit, is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands.  In the case of jointly assessed couples, both of whom are receiving the PUP, the joint tax credits and rate bands are adjusted appropriately. Where one spouse returns to work, the personal tax credit of the remaining PUP recipient is not assigned to the working spouse in the usual manner. It is instead allocated to any excess PUP amount over and above the PUP recipient&rsquo;s PAYE tax credit and rate band.<\/p>  <p>  When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately inform the Department of Social Protection (DSP) who will cease the PUP claim and notify Revenue that the claim has stopped.

Revenue has also assured me that, generally, there is no delay between receipt of DSP notifications that PUP payments have stopped, and the adjustment of the individual&rsquo;s tax credits.

The 2018 Act came into effect on 21 January 2019 and expanded the definition of &lsquo;credit servicing&rsquo; in the 2015 Act to also include the following activities:<\/p>  <p>  - holding the legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement;<\/p>  <p>  - determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements; and<\/p>  <p>  - maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank published Authorisation Requirements and Standards (the Standards) in December 2015. These Standards require that Credit Servicing Firms must be able to demonstrate that they are in a position to conduct their affairs in a manner that ensures the best interests of their customers are protected. The Standards were imposed on Credit Servicing Firms as a condition of authorisation and must be complied with on an on-going basis. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of the 2018 legislation coming into effect on 21 January 2019, the Central Bank published and updated the Standards to reflect the fact that loan owners now fall to be directly regulated. The Standards provide that a Credit Servicing Firms must structure, organise and resource its business to ensure that it is in a position to demonstrate that it can comply with applicable regulatory requirements. This includes ensuring that adequate and effective control of the firm rests in the State, that all firm records are available to the Central Bank, and that the firm is not outsourcing activities to any extent that would impact on its ability to meet all applicable regulatory requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The Standards also contain additional requirements for Credit Servicing Firms which hold the legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement and which engage in associated ownership activities. These requirements include that each Credit Servicing Firms must have effective processes for the development, implementation and oversight of the firm&rsquo;s overall strategy for the management and administration of its portfolios of credit agreements and the maintenance of control over key decisions relating to those portfolios. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision strategy for the credit-servicing sector has a number of elements, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Detailed data gathering and analysis, including mortgage arrears and repossession data, such as the pattern of arrears in the Irish mortgage market by entity type; mortgage arrears profile; restructuring activity in the Irish market; data on alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) and complaints etc. Additionally, obtaining direct evidence from consumers to provide first-hand information about their experiences in dealing with the credit-servicing sector.<\/p>  <p>  - Intensified risk and evidenced-based supervision, which includes both on-site and offsite inspections. The Central Bank will continue to assertively supervise credit servicing firms&rsquo; compliance with the CCMA, to ensure that a fair and transparent process is in place for all borrowers, including those whose loans have been sold.<\/p>  <p>  - Use of its full suite of supervisory powers as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s approach to supervision of the credit-servicing sector is underpinned by an expectation of high standards and a professional and consumer-focused approach to compliance. <\/p>  <p>  Beneficial owners were excluded from the scope of the 2018 Act as their inclusion could have had an impact on entities like passive securitisation vehicles. Irish and European banks use securitisation as a matter of course to raise funds for on-lending to the real economy, mortgage borrowers and SMEs who need access to credit. This is an important and ongoing aspect of the international financial system and passive securitisation vehicles do not have any implications for consumer protection.<\/p>  <p>  If securitisation vehicles needed to be authorised and regulated, a number of unintended consequences may arise. For example, such vehicles could find it impossible to comply with the regulatory requirements of the Central Bank and therefore could be forced out of the market completely. Alternatively, they would have to take on staff and premises and adopt structures in order to meet these requirements and the costs of this would be factored in the price that buyers would be willing to pay for securitisations thereby reducing the liquidity available to the lenders originating securitisations and increasing costs that are likely to be passed to consumer.<\/p>  <p>  As of Q3-2020, Retail Credit Firms and Credit Servicing Firms held 14% of all mortgage accounts, representing 120,341 accounts, with &euro;20.9 billion outstanding.<\/p>  <p>Investment Funds   <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of investment funds established in Ireland. There are two categories of investment funds in Ireland: Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITs), and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) which may be sub divided into Retail and Qualifying Investor AIFs depending on the types of investors they will be marketed to. <\/p>  <p>  Property funds domiciled in Ireland are typically established as Qualifying Investor AIFs. These fall under the Central Bank&rsquo;s AIF Rulebook and are subject to the provisions of the EU&rsquo;s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. A Qualifying Investor AIF must appoint an Alternative Investment Fund Manager who will also be regulated under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.<\/p>  <p>  Section 110 companies are not subject to Central Bank authorisation. There are a number of conditions which a company must meet in order to be regarded as a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&ldquo;TCA 1997&rdquo;).<\/p>  <p>  One of those conditions is that the company notifies Revenue of their intention to be a qualifying company by completing a Form S.110 no later than 8 weeks from the date the company commences its business as a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 TCA 1997. As it is a requirement of section 110 TCA 1997, it is appropriate that the Form S.110 be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners. <\/p>  <p>  However, in addition to the Revenue reporting requirements, under section 18 of the Central Bank Act 1971, all Irish qualifying companies are obliged to report quarterly data to the Central Bank. This is in addition to the reporting obligation which many such companies already have, where they are &ldquo;Financial Vehicle Corporations&rdquo;, to report quarterly data to the Central Bank under Regulation ECB\/2013\/40. This information is then reported to the European Central Bank. The European Central Bank statistics provide harmonised information on the securitisation market and can also be broken down by country.<\/p>  <p>  Further information on the reporting requirements of Special Purpose Vehicles and Financial Vehicle Corporations is available at the websites of the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500054#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500054#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[10722\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500054#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if personal financial supports will be extended for airline workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>I am aware of concerns that have been raised regarding the pace of recovery for the aviation sector, and that it has been suggested that the level of support be increased and\/or that the application of some of the new State supports should be delineated on the basis of explicit sectoral qualification criteria.

For the purpose of prudent budgetary planning, it was also assumed that bilateral trade with the UK would take place on WTO terms from January. Based on these assumptions, my Department projected GDP growth of 1.7 per cent for the year. However, the public health and economic situation has evolved significantly since the Budget forecasts were published. The recent Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK and the earlier than anticipated rollout of vaccines are both positive developments that will improve the economic outlook for this year<b>. <\/b>On the other hand, the ongoing Level 5 restrictions will likely have a contractionary effect on the economy. <\/p><p>While the process of rolling out vaccines will undoubtedly take time and restrictions will be required in the near term, Covid related restrictions will gradually be eased and an economic recovery can then take hold. The speed of this recovery will depend on the pace at which we are able to safely re-open the economy and society. In the near-term after Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed, the recovery in the domestic economy should be supported by the release of pent-up demand financed by the unwinding of historically high levels of household savings.

However, the new agreement still represents a break from the previously existing arrangements; i.e. a permanent shock to our economy.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, even with the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement, Brexit will still have a negative economic impact on the Irish economy - particularly in the most exposed sectors in comparison to the previous trading relationship with the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Joint research published by my Department and the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI) in March 2019 on the macroeconomic implications of Brexit, captured a range of possible future relationships between the EU and the UK.

Lockdown restrictions saw the Irish economy contract sharply by just over 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in Q2, followed by a recovery of 11 per cent in Q3 as restrictions eased. Ireland&rsquo;s quarterly GDP fall in Q2 was significantly less of a decline than that experienced by many EU Member States.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission recently estimated Irish GDP to have grown by 3 per cent in 2020. This compares to an estimated contraction in EU and euro area GDP of -6.3 and almost -7 per cent, respectively, with Ireland the only Member State with positive growth. However, Ireland&rsquo;s GDP has been boosted by a surge in exports of pharmaceuticals, and this masks a very sharp hit to the domestic economy. In contrast, modified domestic demand declined by -6.3 per cent in the first three quarters of last year, figures which are more in line with the impact in other EU countries.<\/p>  <p>  More recently, the pandemic has tightened its grip on Ireland and this has continued to negatively affect the domestic economy. As of 22 February, approximately 1 million people were in receipt of some category of state income assistance, which is still below the peak of 1.2 million on 5 May 2020. This is by no means out of line with the experience of other European countries. The resurgence in infections since the autumn, along with the emergence of new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus, has seen the reintroduction of additional restrictions across the EU. On the other hand, Ireland and other EU Member States are also likely to see the beginnings of a recovery in the second half of the year as vaccine rollout reaches critical targets. As a result, the European Commission are forecasting both EU and euro area GDP to grow by almost 4 per cent in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts with the Stability Programme Update in April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[10878\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which Ireland has been able to avail of any opportunities in Europe arising from Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>Ireland regrets the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, however we have always respected it.

However, it is important to note that the agreement does not completely mitigate against trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers, such as customs checks and procedures.

Under the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, &euro;4 billion of the total &euro;5 billion instrument will be disbursed in 2021 using an allocation method based on the importance of trade in goods and services with the UK and the importance of fisheries in the UK waters. Under the initial &euro;4 billion tranche of funds, Ireland is set to receive approximately &euro;1 billion (&euro;991 million in 2018 prices, or &euro;1052 million when adjusted for inflation).

","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>The popularity of Bitcoin has been increasing rapidly in recent months. In February 2020, one Bitcoin could be purchased for $10,000. It is currently priced at c. $47,000, having reached a historical record price of c $57,500 on 21 February 2021. In other words, this represents a change in value of -2% from a few days ago and +465.2% from one year ago. In contrast, the Euro vs USD exchange has moved by little over 0.10% over the same year.<\/p>  <p>  Assuming that the question as to whether Bitcoin is gradually being recognised as a &ldquo;currency&rdquo; is meant to infer that Bitcoin may be accepted as &ldquo;money&rdquo;, I would like to recap on the three most basic functions of money:<\/p>  <p>  1. Medium of exchange. Money can be used for buying and selling goods and services. <\/p>  <p>  2. Unit of account: Money is the common standard for measuring relative worth of goods and service.<\/p>  <p>  3. Store of value: Money can be saved and used for future purchases with limited risk to its value depreciating<\/p>  <p>  4. These fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin, as evidenced in recent days and months, make its use and applicability as a trusted means of payment rather unreliable and inadequate. In other words, its volatility makes it hard to be used as a medium of exchange. There are other considerations as to why Bitcoin may not be accepted as a &ldquo;currency&rdquo;. For example, as a means of payment, it is slow when compared to credit card payment transactions or online SEPA payments. VISA for example, can process +1700 transactions per second. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain can process 3,000 transactions every 10 minutes. <\/p>  <p>  5. Bitcoin has been labelled a currency, a commodity and a new investment asset class. What may be happening is that Bitcoin is gradually being adopted not so much as a &ldquo;currency&rdquo; or means of payment, but as an investment. Buyers of Bitcoin tend to hold on to their purchases with the expectation that this &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;digital commodity&rdquo; will increase in value. This would mean that Bitcoin may be gradually recognised as a commodity, not a currency.<\/p>  <p>  6. It can be said that Covid-19 has had an effect in the wider acceptance of Bitcoin as a commodity. First, the pandemic has accelerated the move to transacting and living in a digital world: what might have taken 10 years (in technology adoption terms) has been achieved in 10 months. People were forced to drop the use of cash and become proficient in online payments. As people became more comfortable with making financial transactions online, access to cryptocurrencies (not only Bitcoin) have been made more accessible to the public. Bitcoin can be traded 24\/7, unlike other traditional stocks. This availability, combined with the allure of its increasing value, may have attracted more investors into Bitcoin. <\/p>  <p>  7. Its scarcity cannot be ignored, however. The Bitcoin protocol was written with a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins. There are already 18,623,718 BTC coins mined, or in circulation. As the reward for mining Bitcoin halves every 210,000 blocks, so does the reward, which makes the current Bitcoin in circulation increase in value. This programmed scarcity is why Bitcoin has been increasingly called &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  8. In fact, there are financial instruments based on Bitcoin available to purchase: exchange-traded funds, commonly known as an ETFs, a type of investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset, such as gold, oil, an index, or a basket of stocks. It is traded on exchanges in the same way as stocks. <\/p>  <p>  9. This would point to the fact that Bitcoin may be recognised globally more as a commodity than a currency.<\/p>  <p>  10. Finally, considering the current negative interest rates markets, it is possible that many investors are purchasing Bitcoin as an alternative avenue to earn investment returns. Recently, some financial institutions have publicly announced significant investments in Bitcoin, as a means to diversify the risk of their investment portfolios. While purchases of Bitcoin seem more &ldquo;main stream&rdquo;, its use a payment mechanism (and thus its use as a fiat currency) is rare. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":198,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 68 and 69 answered with Question No. 44.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Asset Management Agency","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[10887\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the value of properties currently held by NAMA; the value of all such property disposed of to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>I am advised that NAMA does not typically own property, rather NAMA acquired a portfolio of loans for which the properties act as security.

These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);<\/p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income: cost inefficiencies have been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years;<\/p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with their lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[10890\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which basic economic fundamentals continue to be recognised and applied in the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>Prior to the pandemic Irish economic fundamentals were very strong, with robust growth, a labour market close to full employment, and surpluses in the current account and the public finances. The outbreak of the pandemic turned the economy on its head in the space of a few weeks however, with the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions resulting in a sharp contraction in economic activity in the spring last year. However, in keeping with the pattern seen in other countries, the economy rebounded over the summer months as restrictions were eased. <\/p>  <p>  According to the European Commission&rsquo;s winter forecast, Ireland is now expected to be the only country in Europe to record positive GDP growth in 2020. However, we must be cognisant that GDP figures do not provide an accurate representation of domestic economic activity, given the size of our multinational sector. Indeed, the &lsquo;dual-nature&rsquo; of the Irish economy &ndash; characterised by highly productive and mainly foreign-owned MNCs on one side and domestic-SMEs on the other &ndash; has become even more pronounced during the pandemic. Parts of the multinational sector, most notably pharmaceuticals and ICT, have performed strongly throughout the pandemic. In contrast, the hit to the domestic economy has been severe, with domestic-facing sectors, such as hospitality, leisure and education, bearing the brunt of the economic impact. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of the pandemic on domestic economic activity is most evident in the labour market. The unemployment rate, which peaked at over 30 per cent in April last year, remains elevated and stood at around 25 per cent in January and there are currently over 1 million people in receipt of some form of State income support. While the impact on the labour market has undoubtedly been severe, government supports such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Wage Subsidy Schemes have helped cushion the impact on household incomes. <\/p>  <p>  With the vaccine programme now underway, there is light at the end of the tunnel. While this process will take time and restrictions will be required in the near term, as the vaccine programme picks up speed and the public health situation improves, these restrictions will gradually be eased and an economic recovery will take hold. In the meantime, as we continue to live with the virus and manage the public health threat posed by Covid-19, it is crucial that we continue to support households and firms and get people back to work as soon as it is safe to do so in order to minimise any potential long-term damage to the labour market, thereby aiding our economic recovery. More broadly, as a small, open and adaptable economy, our resilience and strength comes from being one that remains open to investment and facilitates trade across our borders. This has been proven to be the strength of the Irish economy over decades and is still the case today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[10928\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500055#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if guidance and advice will be provided to the public in respect of charges that are payable on items purchased online from the UK; the permissible taxes; the permissible customs duty; the permissible other charges on these transactions; the recourse for consumers who are overcharged under these headings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that since 1 January 2021, the UK has been outside the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and the trading relationship between Ireland and Great Britain has changed considerably.

In 2019 the construction tender price index surpassed its previous peak from 2007. The index was estimated to have increased by 6.6 percent over 2019.

A core goal of this Department is to continue to deliver reforms for Government through improved, cost-effective public services across a range of areas including governance, accountability, procurement, shared services, organisational redesign and property management. <\/p>  <p>  The existing framework for public service reform and innovation, Our Public Service 2020 (OPS2020), builds on earlier reforms, whilst expanding their scope in order to accelerate the digital delivery of public services, deliver better outcomes for citizens, drive innovation and help to develop our people and organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Notable examples of initiatives that have been delivered include:<\/p>  <p>- Digital  : transforming and driving digital delivery of services, such as, for example; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Active Mobility Service; passport on-line; the Library Service&rsquo;s My Open Library initiative; the Revenue Commissioners PAYE Modernisation programme<\/p>  <p>- Innovation:   the Public Service Innovation Strategy, Making Innovation Real, was launched in November 2020 to enable our public services become more effective and efficient for the citizen;   a Public Service Innovation Fund has been established to support innovation projects across the Public Service; the establishment of a central innovation support team; the creation of a Public Service-wide innovation network, and; the implementation of an annual Public Service-wide innovation week, amongst other initiatives  <\/p>  <p>- Emerging Technology  : driving the take-up of Robotic Process Automation through a dedicated procurement framework, facilitating swift and easy draw down of licences, supports and expertise to create efficiencies in back-office functions<\/p>  <p>- Strategic Human Resource Management:   a significant review of strategic workforce planning was undertaken in selected public service organisations. A range of support materials to enable greater use of this strategic resource management tool have also been published<\/p>  <p>- Diversity and Inclusion:   following a consultative process with Civil Society representing people covered by the nine grounds of equality legislation, a range of supports have been developed to  promote greater diversity and inclusion in our Public Service<\/p>  <p>- Governance:   creation of the Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB) - at Secretary General and equivalent level- supported by the Public Service Management Group (PSMG) to oversee the governance of reform efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Innovations and reforms are also underway outside of the OPS2020 framework in organisations across the Civil and Public Service. For example, in this Department, a number of budgetary reforms have also been introduced in recent years including a renewed Public Spending Code and additional spending reviews. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware public service reform is also at the heart of the new public service pay agreement - Building Momentum 2021\/2022.    Under the new Agreement, the parties will be working over the coming weeks to agree action plans to give effect to the reform commitments in the Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is currently in the process of preparing a successor framework to OPS2020. Similar work is also well-advanced in framing a further renewal plan for the Civil Service, in addition to an examination of the organisational structure and design of our Civil Service.  These agendas will focus on large-scale ambitious transformation to support greater cost-effectiveness through enhanced digital service delivery, the development of our data infrastructure, and by building the workforce and workplace of the future arising from the transformative effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>In terms of meeting annual targets, any forthcoming reform plan will seek to support priorities that have been articulated in the Programme for Government, in addition to other reform priorities that are identified across Government.

For any meaningful progress on Turkey&rsquo;s relationship with the EU to occur, Turkey needs to change course and show sustained commitment to the rule of law.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland ascribes the greatest importance to the principles of equality and non-discrimination, and advancing human rights is central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. We are committed to promoting the rights of LGBTQI+ people, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and discrimination around the world. Ireland continues to support initiatives in the EU and other international fora which promote and protect the rights of LGBTQI+ people, and which condemn violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500059#WRH04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500059#WRH04400"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[10816\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500059#WRH04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of formal and informal Council of the European Union meetings that have been held since 27 June 2020 under the remit of his Department; and the number of formal and informal meetings, respectively held virtually.","asker":"1603","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>The Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and the General Affairs Council (GAC) fall under the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Foreign Affairs Council configuration, there have been 6 physical FAC meetings &ndash; 13 July 2020, 21 September 2020, 12 October 2020, 7 December 2020, 25 January 2021 and 22 February 2021.

The MSPC owes its origins to the decision of the Oireachtas of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann in June 1923 to recognise and compensate wounded members, and the widows, children and dependents of deceased members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, including the National Forces, the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Republican Army and the Irish Citizen Army through the payment of allowances and gratuities.  Over time, provision was enhanced and broadened to include members of the Hibernian Rifles, Cumann na mBan, Fianna &Eacute;ireann and certain members of the Connaught Rangers.  Two streams of legislation are relevant to the material in the collection:<\/p>  <p>  - The Army Pensions Acts from 1923 to 1953<\/p>  <p>  - The Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924, 1934 and 1949. <\/p>  <p>  The MSPC project is mandated to preserve and make available the files and records of the Department of Defence dealing with the service of qualifying members of these organisations from the period April 1916 to the 30th of September 1923. This involves cataloguing and digitising in excess of 275,000 files <\/p>  <p>  Public release of material from the collection is made available online through the Military Archives website www.militaryarchives.ie.  To date there have been nine online releases of material, the most recent release was in October 2020.  Since its first release of material, over 100,000 files have been processed with approximately 40,000 files scanned.  Over 2 million individual pages have been digitised since the commencement of the project. <\/p>  <p>  The latest release of material, along with previous releases, provides an invaluable source of information that continues to greatly facilitate research around this defining period in Irish history, and captures first-hand accounts of individuals that participated in events of that period. <\/p>  <p>  The digitisation of the file, which is performed for both preservation and for access, is only one small aspect of the process in making files available to the public.  In order to follow international standards for archival cataloguing and before a file is scanned it must be examined physically, repaired and cleaned. Information is also extracted for database retrieval online and any GDPR issues are examined. The file may then need to be flattened to ensure that it is safe to be handled for scanning. It is only after this process has been completed that the file may be scanned. Each scanned file is then linked to its archival description and following this process, files are ready to be released online. <\/p>  <p>  For files held in the Military Services Pension Collection, on average one single claimant may have 3 files under their name.  In addition, and to note, files can vary in size from a couple of pages up to several hundred pages.  To date, the project team have scanned the files of circa 15,000 applicants, which represent around 40,000 files.  It is estimated that the collection encompasses the claims of approx 80,000 applicants.  There has been a focus on prioritising the digitisation of files of successful claimants which generally are larger in size than files of unsuccessful claimants and therefore take longer to process.  <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Military Services Pensions Collection project during 2021 is to continue to make additional files available through planned releases, adding to the substantial corpus of digitised primary sources already available online. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500060#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reserve","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500060#WRJ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[10607\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500060#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of Reserve Defence Force personnel by barracks; if there will be a recruitment campaign in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>For reasons of operational security, it is not possible to release Reserve Defence Force (RDF) strength figures by barracks.  <\/p><p>The RDF is comprised of the Army Reserve (AR), the Naval Service Reserve (NSR) and the First Line Reserve (FLR).

It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. <\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the well-being, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS also provides training to schools in programmes to reduce anxiety and promote coping and resilience in children and young people. <\/p>  <p>  The curriculum also plays an important role in teaching students about managing their well-being. All students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Well-being. Well-being crosses the three years of Junior Cycle and builds on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; well-being. When planning a Well-being Programme schools should consider the NCCA developed short courses in PE, SPHE, and CSPE. In particular the SPHE short course Strand 4: My Mental Health focuses on building positive mental health, examining young people&rsquo;s experience of mental ill health and learning how to support themselves and others in challenging times. These are the result of widespread consultation with education partners to ensure that the courses address important, relevant and meaningful learning for young people in these subjects. Well-being is one of the principles that underpins Junior Cycle education and is reflected in a number of the statements of learning that are central to planning for the student&rsquo;s experience of and the evaluation of the schools Junior Cycle programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Well-being is mandatory in all primary schools as part of the SPHE curriculum. At primary level the SPHE curriculum is designed to foster children&rsquo;s well-being, self-confidence and sense of belonging develops children&rsquo;s sense of personal responsibility for their own behaviour and actions.

The levels of support are:<\/p>  <p>- Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the LINC training programme in Leadership for Inclusion, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation for services with qualified Inclusion Coordinators.<\/p>  <p>- Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County\/City Childcare Committees. <\/p>  <p>- Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children wishing to participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).<\/p>  <p>- Level 4 addresses the needs of early years practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early years education (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs. <\/p>  <p>- Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or that some early years settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some capital building works for a service.<\/p>  <p>- Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable the child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE Programme. <\/p>  <p>- Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room   involves additional capitation for service  providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff \/ child ratio, supporting the Pre-School Leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.<\/p>  <p>  Local County Childcare Committees (CCC) help provide information on pre-school settings in their locality that may have capacity for children, including those with physical and intellectual disabilities, to attend.

The Programme for Government commits to continuing to fund Abhaile, and to introducing the necessary reforms to our personal insolvency legislation to ensure that sufficient supports are in place for mortgage holders with repayment difficulties. This also reflects the Government&rsquo;s ongoing prioritisation of more vulnerable citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic and for the period of national recovery which will follow. There is, in addition,  a commitment to reviewing the scheme this year.<\/p><p>An important component of Abhaile relates to the provision of legal aid for proceedings under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (as amended). This legislation provides for a process where a proposal for personal insolvency arrangement can be implemented by a court even if rejected by creditors at a creditors meeting.  <\/p><p>The legal aid available includes the services of a solicitor from the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s Abhaile Solicitors&rsquo; Panel and payment to the personal insolvency practitioner with respect to the expenses they occur in making the section 115A application. Prior to 1 March 2019, the services of Junior Counsel were funded in all s115A applications. Since that date the services of Counsel may be sought on a case-by-case basis as is the case in other civil legal aid matters. <\/p><p>These Panels and supports are administered independently by the Legal Aid Board under the relevant legislative and regulatory provisions. They are also subject to statutory audit and certification by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and subject to the relevant Internal Audit and corporate governance procedures. The following information has been provided in the form of three Schedules by the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p>Schedule A sets out the amounts spent by the Legal Aid Board on solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 during the year 2020. <\/p><p>Schedule B sets out the amount paid by the Legal Aid Board to each individual solicitor, barrister and personal insolvency practitioner for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 during the year 2020. <\/p><p>Schedule C sets out the total amounts incurred but not yet paid by the Legal Aid Board in connection with solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 as at 1 January 2021, and the amount of those liabilities which were accrued during 2020. It is assumed that the accrued fee will be invoiced in full.<\/p><p>I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board and am informed that the Legal Aid Board is not in a position to provide information as to individual amounts accrued into the future by individual service providers. This is because the legal aid recipients concerned engage their own solicitor from the panel on foot of a legal aid certificate and it is for that solicitor (if authorised to do so) to instruct Counsel.  The Legal Aid Board does not therefore become aware of which solicitor and barrister has been so engaged until the relevant claim is later submitted to it for that purpose. <\/p><p>Schedule A<\/p><p>Fees actually paid (inc VAT) to personal insolvency practitioners, solicitors, and barristers in respect of legally aided applications under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (as amended) <table>    <tr>       <th>Financial Year<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fees to barristers <\/td>       <td>&euro;194,881 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fees to personal insolvency   practitioners<\/td>       <td>&euro;890,239 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fees to solicitors <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,700,176 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,785,296 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Schedule B<\/p><p>Part 1 &ndash; Fees paid to solicitors <table>    <tr>       <th>Payee<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Anthony Joyce &amp;amp; Co <\/td>       <td>&euro;282,817 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Catherine Allison &amp;amp; Co <\/td>       <td>&euro;269,881 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Elizabeth Howard &amp;amp; Co Solicitors <\/td>       <td>&euro;250,055 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Hanlon &amp;amp; Company Solicitors <\/td>       <td>&euro;179,400 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ashtown Gate Solicitors <\/td>       <td>&euro;179,174 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Alan McGee &amp;amp; Co Solicitors <\/td>       <td>&euro;139,427 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louisa C.

Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.<\/p><p>Successful applicants under the IIP and their nominated family members may be granted a residence permission in Ireland under Stamp 4 conditions. Stamp 4 conditions permit non-EEA nationals to work, study or start their own businesses in Ireland. Therefore, given the significant immigration benefits accruing it is essential that all applications are subject to a robust due diligence process in respect of both personal and financial checks to protect the State's interests. In this regard, a number of enhanced control mechanisms have been introduced to the Programme within the past 12 months. <\/p><p>The IIP has been subject to a number of reviews, both internal and external, in recent years.

The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. <\/p><p>As I'm sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading the virus to others.  Under the current public health measures in place for Covid-19 live music is not permitted at weddings. <\/p><p>It is not possible to say what public health measures will be in place in the future.

Over the last number of months, my Department and the HSE have, in close collaboration, developed numerous public health information campaigns that covering these behaviours in depth, for radio, TV, digital and print media. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Department of Health has held press briefings from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ensure that experts in public health are to the fore when informing the public about the disease&rsquo;s pattern and progression within Ireland and the restrictions required at any given time to prevent the spread of the disease. This gives journalists from a broad cross section of the media the opportunity to ask key figures such as the Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Medical Officer questions on a regular and consistent basis, in order to counter the potential spread of misinformation. <\/p>  <p>  In a media relations sense, representatives of the NPHET are also regularly available for media interview across all major media outlets such as RTE, Newstalk and Virgin Media News, to answer questions and provide responses to any concerns posed to them by media or the general public in relation to the pandemic and Ireland&rsquo;s response to it.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of online resources, each daily press release issued by the Department of Health, specific links are provided to the COVID-19 dashboard, where detailed information on the spread of COVID-19 and key indicators in the community are available. This includes information such as the number of hospitalisations, ICU figures, tests carried out, and information on case numbers given at LEA level. <\/p>  <p>  Consistently, the Department of Health has directed followers on social media to official sources of information, such as the Government website, the COVID-19 Data Hub and the HSE&rsquo;s website. The HSE also undertakes considerable social media advertising campaigns in order to promote public health guidelines and advice across platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. <\/p>  <p>  All of this work is supported by regular opinion polling carried out by Am&aacute;rach.

Clinical placement learning makes up 50% of these programmes. Placements, where students are immersed in the care environments, enables students to develop the practical knowledge, clinical skills and professional behaviours required to qualify and be eligible to join the professional register. Supernumerary clinical student placements ensure learning takes place on the front line and that the experience is gained under the supervision of a registered nurse or midwife.\u00a0I want to protect their status as students and protect their graduate programme which has delivered so many benefits.<\/p>  <p>  When the pandemic was declared in March 2020 our healthcare system had to re-configure quickly. This resulted in many staff being redeployed, including some staff required for the supervision and support of students in the clinical setting. Following redeployment, the student support infrastructure was impacted significantly and all clinical placements were suspended by the HSE on 10 April 2020.\u00a0Redeployment, sick leave and COVID 19 related absence also led to a workforce crisis at that time.\u00a0 One measure used in responding to the workforce demand at the time was that student nurses and midwifes were offered a 3-month contract as Healthcare Assistants (HCAs). This initiative was on a voluntary basis and 1,200 (approx. 30%) took up a contract.  As we moved into 2021 the HSE, despite the continuing challenges associated with the pandemic, was in a much stronger position in terms of staffing.\u00a0 The HSE hired an additional 1,158 Health Care Assistants in 2020 as well as 1,712 Nurses and Midwives to respond to the additional challenges faced on the front line. At the end of the December 2020, the health sector workforce had a total of 126,174 WTE. This is an increase of 6,357 WTE since the end of December 2019.<\/p>  <p>  To further assist student nurses and midwives on clinical placements, I appointed Profes\u00adsor Tom Collins to carry out an independent review of the clinical placement allowance spe\u00adcifically during COVID-19, a more stressful time of which we are all aware. Professor Collins reported back to me on 31 December, 2020 and made several recommendations which I have accepted. One of which was his recommendation to implement a pandemic placement grant, which is the non-taxable &euro;100 per week for each supernumerary placement week during the pandemic. He provided an option for me to backdate this to the start of September. Therefore, the recommendation is that the 12 weeks of placement essentially would be subject to a non-taxable payment of &euro;1,200. As stated I have accepted the recommendations and work is ongoing to implement Professor Collins&rsquo;s recommendation for\u00a0  a pandemic placement grant by making the associated payments. We continue the engagements with the representative bodies on this matter and the long term review. <\/p>  <p>  The long-term review of the placements and allowances to be carried out, I believe this is very important. This will go some way to addressing some of the issues that have been raised  by Deputies and others around supporting students to be students and assisting with some of the financial barriers that can impact students while they are undertaking their placements particularly when the placements are away from the base hospital.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  That is one of the points that is going to be examined in the long-term review. The work has commenced and I have asked that I receive a report in June. That will give us some time to work with the students themselves, the representative bodies, the educators and all the stake\u00adholders and work to implement any recommendations from the start of the academic year this coming September.<\/p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the difficulties that student nurses and midwives have had over the past year. Without question, it continues to be a difficult time. My Department and I, in conjunction with the HSE, higher education institutes, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, our clinical partners and representative organisations, will continue to focus on sup\u00adporting our students, keeping them safe and ensuring they have the best possible education that they can have.<\/p>  <p>As the Deputy is aware, supernumerary clinical placements for 1-3rd\u00a0year nursing and midwifery students were temporarily suspended from 18 January to support the HSE request to release senior, qualified staff employed to support student placements who had the necessary experience to help directly with the COVID-19 response.\u00a0 \u00a0However, placements with the necessary supports in place, have been gradually resuming and\u00a0 this week  99%\u00a0 of the nursing and midwifery students who were due to be on clinical placement were on placement.\u00a0Intern and 4th year supernumerary placements have continued uninterrupted during this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500068#WRR03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":795,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500068#WRR03200"},{"type":"question","counter":796,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[10674\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500068#WRR03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which the recommendations of the report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on evaluating orphan drugs have been implemented; if an impact assessment has been conducted on those which have; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":797,"content":"<p>The Deputy will recall that in February 2018 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health issued its report which contained a significant number of recommendations with respect to the evaluation of orphan drugs.<\/p><p>On 21 November 2018, Departmental and HSE officials, at a hearing of the Committee, reported on progress on the implementation of the various recommendations.<\/p><p>In view of the passage of time since that hearing, I have asked my officials to prepare an updated report for the Deputy on the extent to which each of the recommendations have been implemented.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500068#WRR03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":799,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[10675\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500068#WRR03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the process for the approval of new drugs; his plans to review or alter this process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":800,"content":"<p>All medicines must be authorised before they can be marketed and made available to patients.

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary. It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments). Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.  <\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.

At that time, emergency legislation was introduced which amended all the regulatory acts to provide for a COVID-19 specific register to which no fees would be attached.  The Act provided that the COVID-19 registration would end on 31 July 2020, but that this could be extended by means of Ministerial order.  Orders were  made in July, 2020 extending the temporary registrations to 31 December 2020, and again in December further extending to 30 June 2021 the temporary registration provisions relating to medical practitioners, pharmacists and CORU registrants.  <\/p><p>Given that nursing and midwifery registration is based on a calendar year, an Order was not needed in July extending these to end December 2020, but rather the Irish Nursing and Midwifery Board (NMBI) was able to deal with such registrations  ( including any new applications ) under its existing legislation. This continues to be the position and I can confirm that retired nurses who wish to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic response, including the vaccination programme, can avail of temporary restoration to the NMBI register free of charge. The NMBI has informed my Department that it is currently working with the HSE and other employers to facilitate speedy restoration in these cases. As part of this, the NMBI is currently updating the registration system MyNMBI so that, from Monday next, 1 March 2021, fees will be waived automatically upon restoration - . Those wishing to restore on MyNMBI and who need support with the process can contact the NMBI directly at IEReg@nmbi.ie.<\/p><p>In addition, the NMBI is also now making arrangements to refund fees paid by some registrants who may not have been aware of the availability of free temporary restoration for purposes of assisting with the COVID-19 pandemic response. <\/p><p>I very much welcome the offer of the association referred to by the Deputy and its members, to return to the NMBI register to assist with the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To expedite this the NMBI has contacted the association in recent days. <\/p><p>Finally, to clarify the general position applying to restoration to the Register. It is open to a nurse or midwife  to apply at  any time to be removed from the Register of the NMBI, for example on retirement. This is categorised as a voluntary removal and such registrants who later wish to be restored need only to pay the annual  renewal fee of &euro;100, which is the same amount as all other current registrants.  Those registrants who have been removed from the register following non-payment of the renewal fee of &euro;100, and who later wish to be restored, incur an additional administration charge of &euro;250 in addition to the annual fee of &euro;100.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ophthalmology Services","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS01600"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[10702\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) who requested glasses will receive an appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":827,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Bereavement Support","counter":828,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS01900"},{"type":"question","counter":829,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[10707\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE will facilitate a community-based health organisation (details supplied) in the CHO8 area.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":830,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":831,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS02200"},{"type":"question","counter":832,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[10731\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500069#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department or the HSE have a policy on which the Covid-19 vaccine is administered to persons, for example, which takes into account existing medical conditions such as gastrointestinal side effects.","asker":"1570","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":833,"content":"<p>The revised Vaccine Allocation Strategy developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, in conjunction with the Department of Health, and endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team, was approved by Government on the 23rd of February.<\/p><p>In the initial vaccine allocation strategy, the NIAC listed several medical conditions associated with an increased risk of serious illness and death.

The NPHET agreed that at present, there is insufficient high-quality evidence with respect to vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, and noted that ongoing developments, particularly Randomised Control Trials, in this area be monitored by the NPHET with guidance reviewed accordingly. <\/p><p>The NPHET agreed that efforts should be made to increase awareness of existing guidance. Adults spending increased time indoors or those who are housebound or in long-term residential care or have dark skin pigmentation are also recommended to take a daily vitamin D supplement. <\/p><p>These recommendations for the use of vitamin D are being incorporated into wider messaging, and additionally are being communicated across the health service, including nursing homes and social care settings, as necessary. <\/p><p>The Department of Health has recently written to the HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland to encourage implementation of guidance on vitamin D in nursing homes. <\/p><p>The Government will continue to look to the NPHET to provide recommendations with regard to Vitamin D and COVID-19.  <\/p><p>Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin <\/p><p>The Deputy is advised that, at the request of the NPHET, HIQA conducted a rapid evidence review to identify studies on the effectiveness of (i) pharmaceutical and (ii) non-pharmaceutical interventions, in the ambulatory setting, aimed at reducing progression to severe disease in individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin.<\/p><p>Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. The HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting to reduce the risk of progression to severe disease in patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 unless as part of an ongoing monitored clinical trial. Furthermore, no evidence was identified for the effectiveness or safety of any non-pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting.  <\/p><p>As confirmed by the HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group (), evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. <\/p><p>The HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. The HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4th February 2021 published a statement including the following: <\/p><p>&ldquo;It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified: <\/p><p>- No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; <\/p><p>- No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;<\/p><p>- A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies. <\/p><p>We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo; <\/p><p>I trust that the above information satisfactorily addresses your question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":896,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT03900"},{"type":"question","counter":897,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[10861\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of public health doctors and specialists who have been appointed since the outbreak of Covid-19; the number who will be appointed in 2021; the grade at which they will be appointed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":898,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT04200"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[10863\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current plans to administer vaccines to those who are aged over 85 years, are completely housebound and, therefore, cannot attend a doctor's surgery or a vaccination centre; and if the HSE is making provisions to administer vaccines in the home in such cases.","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":902,"content":"<p>Question No. 315 answered with Question No. 310.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT04600"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[10867\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500070#WRT04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the access to care fund and the HSE national treatment fund action plan for 2021 announced in budget 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>The annual Scheduled Care Access Plan sets out yearly activity targets for the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), along with measures to improve care for patients waiting for Scheduled Care. <\/p>  <p>  Each year the Access Plan focuses on reducing waiting times for identified high-volume procedures, as well as very long waiters.

The relevant CFP Control Regulations do not define \"supertrawler\" or \"factory trawler\". However, \"factory ship\" is referred to in Annex XXIII of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 404\/2011 (the Fisheries Control Implementing Regulation) in the context of the type of vessel to be recorded as part the information included in surveillance reports regarding sightings and detection of fishing vessels. Similarly, Annex XB of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1010\/2009 (the Implementing Regulation for rules on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing) refers to \"factory ship\" in the context of the type of vessel recorded in reports of sighted vessels.<\/p>  <p>  These terms are sometimes used to describe large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks such as mackerel, horse mackerel and herring.

This migration brings some of the fish into the Irish 200 miles zone for part of the year. At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway. There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a national quota for Bluefin Tuna. The available Bluefin Tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s. At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.<\/p>  <p>  A small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery where there can be Bluefin Tuna by-catch. In this regard, the UK also had a share of the Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota and, under the EU\/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, a share of the EU&rsquo;s Bluefin Tuna quota (0.25%) has been transferred to UK. We are seeking that this transfer to the UK is taken from the overall EU quota and is not taken from the by-catch quota available to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data. A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019 and supports the collection of valuable data on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters.<\/p>  <p>  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU. The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU and would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.<\/p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.

However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone. <\/p>  <p>  While the outcome on fisheries was a difficult compromise, this Government is working to ensure that the fisheries sector, and the coastal communities that depend on it, are supported. I advised the EU Fisheries Council in January and again at the meeting earlier this week  that we consider that the quota transfers that fall to us in Ireland are disproportionate in terms of burden sharing. I have also made it clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly and Ireland will continue to push for a mechanism to be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions. Ireland intends to continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Hague preferences, there are based on commitments made in Annex VII of Council Resolution of 3 November 1976 (the Hague Resolution) to take account of the vital needs of communities which were especially dependent on fishing when allocating fishing quotas to each of the Member States. This commitment was later quantified as specified minimum quantities of quota for certain fish stocks to be allocated to certain fisheries dependent communities. The regions to which they applied were Ireland, northern parts of the UK. <\/p>  <p>  The Hague Resolution passed on 3 November 1976 introduced the 200nm Exclusive Fisheries Zone for all the Member States of the European Community as well as laying down a series of guidelines for the development of the Common Fisheries Policy and obtaining a mandate to begin negotiations with third countries with regards to obtaining access rights to their newly claimed territorial waters. Ireland did not have a long distance fleet at that time and could only support these measures on the basis of commitments that allowed it to develop its fishing fleet. The Hague Resolution was also intended to recognise the considerable burden placed on Ireland to control the large fishing grounds in its 200 zone.<\/p>  <p>  There is strong opposition each year from some Member states to the application of the Hague Preferences, which provide Ireland (and previously the UK) with additional quota for key fish stocks. These Member States argue that the Hague Preferences were taken into account when allocations keys were first established in 1983.<\/p>  <p>Within the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)  Regulation 1380\/2013, the Hague Preferences are recognised as forming part of relative stability in the allocation of fish stocks between Member States. Ireland has consistently, and successfully, argued each year since that  when quotas are set at EU level, the Hague preference must be applied. It is important to be aware that the matter was the subject of a European Court of Justice Judgment which found that the application of the Hague Preferences is not a legal entitlement and that its application is at the discretion of the EU Fisheries Council.<\/p>  <p>  The EU\/ UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement sets down in Annex Fish.1 the UK shares of fish stocks which are shared with the EU for the period 2021 to 2026 onwards. The share of the stocks set for the EU will be allocated within the EU under relative stability. In that regard, I can fully assure the Deputy that I will be requiring that the Hague Preferences are applied to relevant stocks, after the completion of the current consultations with the UK for establishing TACs for shared stocks, when the EU Council adopts EU Total Allowable Catches and quotas, which is expected at the March Fisheries Council.<\/p>  <p>  As I have already advised, I am finalising plans to set up a Task Force involving seafood industry representatives and other stakeholders to provide recommendations on the appropriate measures that will best support the sector and the local coastal communities. I intend to set out in the arrangements and the terms of reference for this Task Force very shortly. I will ask the Task Force to focus immediately on possible arrangements for a temporary fleet tie-up scheme to counter the impacts of the reduction in quotas which will impact our fishing industry from the beginning of April. The Task Force will, I hope, also provide recommendations on a range of other actions and measures that will allow the sector and the coastal communities to adjust and develop so that both the direct and downstream future impacts on the wider seafood sector can be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  Any change to the existing system of quota allocations within the EU would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares.

However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement sets out new arrangements for the joint management of more than 100 shared fish stocks in EU and UK waters. Under the Agreement, EU fishing vessels will continue to have the current level of access to UK waters until 2026, but with a reduction of EU quotas in UK waters over that time. The changes in shares of stocks between the EU and the UK are set out in the Annexes to the Agreement from 2021-2026 (onwards). The share of the stocks set for the EU will be allocated within the EU by the Fisheries Council under relative stability and I will be working to ensure that this includes the application of the Hague Preferences.   <\/p>  <p>  The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record). The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels reduce below a specified level.<\/p>  <p>  Any change to the existing system of quota allocations would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system.

I advised the EU Fisheries Council in January and again at the meeting earlier this week that we consider that the quota transfers that fall to us in Ireland are disproportionate in terms of burden sharing. I have also made it clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly and Ireland will continue to push for a mechanism to be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions. Ireland intends to continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) will provide support to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in Member States, regions and sectors, in particular those that are worst affected by that withdrawal, and to mitigate the related impact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion. I have listened carefully to the representatives of the fishing industry and I am reflecting on how to ensure that the funding made available to the sector is focused to meet the challenges of the sector and of the coastal communities most impacted. <\/p>  <p>  I am finalising plans to set up a Task Force involving seafood industry representatives and other stakeholders to provide recommendations on the appropriate measures that will best support the sector and the local coastal communities. I intend to set out in the arrangements and the terms of reference for this Task Force very shortly. I will ask the Task Force to focus immediately on possible arrangements for a temporary fleet tie-up scheme to counter the impacts of the reduction in quotas which will impact our fishing industry from the beginning of April. The Task Force will, I hope, also provide recommendations on a range of other actions and measures that will allow the sector and the coastal communities to adjust and develop so that both the direct and downstream future impacts on the wider seafood sector can be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s forthcoming Seafood Development Programme 2021-27 under the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund will also play an important role over the next seven years in assisting our seafood sector adjust to the impacts of the TCA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500074#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1048,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500074#WRX00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1049,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[10800\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021022500074#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if it is planned to strengthen the staffing numbers in the marine sector of his Department by the appointment of new and extra senior staff in order to prepare fully and diligently to protect Ireland&rsquo;s maritime interests during the forthcoming renegotiations of the Common Fisheries Policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1050,"content":"<p>My Department uses workforce planning processes to identify the critical resources necessary to formulate long-term strategic policy development to encourage the continuing prosperity of Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector, including the fisheries sector.
