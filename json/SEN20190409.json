In 2017 the Minister, Deputy Harris, visited St. John's and acknowledged that he could see the need for the 120 beds to be replaced.  My question is whether St. John's Hospital will be included in the capital plan.  University Hospital Limerick is in the news all the time in respect of its beds and its bed capacity.  While 60 modular beds have been started, it will be a while before they will be opened.  We need to start planning for the future.  Attendance numbers are up at both University Hospital Limerick and St. John's Hospital.  St. John's Hospital is a minor injuries clinic but it does some day procedures and if it received 120 replacement beds on a permanent basis, it would be able to carry out more procedures and deal with more minor injuries.  This would alleviate the pressure on University Hospital Limerick.  The beds need to go ahead at the same time as in University Hospital Limerick because we need to alleviate the pressure.  People come from all over the mid-west and Nenagh Hospital is now carrying out cataract operations but we need St. John's Hospital and University Hospital Limerick to deliver at full capacity to meet the needs of the mid-west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#B00400","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue and I commend her on her work to drive the project at St. John's Hospital.  I know she has a particular interest in it and that she is very committed to the people of Limerick.  It also gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the proposed capital development of a 120-bed ward to replace the existing ward accommodation at St. John's Hospital, Limerick.<\/p> <p>St. John's is a model 2S voluntary hospital within the University of Limerick hospitals group covering Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary.  The hospital currently has 88 inpatient medical beds and ten beds for day surgery.  It also provides a medical assessment unit, a minor injuries unit and five-day surgery to the people of the region.  I understand the current proposal is for a 120-bed replacement ward block, consisting of four units of 30 single rooms for inpatient ward accommodation.  Progress in respect of these and all other capital projects are subject to the availability of capital funding.  All healthcare infrastructure developments, including this development, must comply with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines and EU directives and will require a lead-in time to complete the various stages of public capital projects.  These stages include appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, detailed design, some of which may overlap, the review of costing estimates and the finalisation of financing.<\/p> <p>The national development plan, NDP, announced last year as part of the Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative, provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care.  The delivery of NDP projects and programmes, including developments in Limerick, will result in healthcare facilities that allow for implementation of new models of care and for delivery of services in high-quality modern facilities.  The revised health capital allocation in 2019 is &euro;642 million for the construction and equipping of health facilities.  The Department and the Health Service Executive are currently engaged in a process to finalise the HSE capital plan for 2019.  In developing its capital plan for 2019 and future years, the HSE must consider a range of issues, including the expenditure that is contractually committed, the HSE's annual requirement in relation to meeting risks associated with clinical equipment, ambulances and healthcare infrastructure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The HSE capital plan will propose the projects that can be progressed in 2019 and beyond, having regard to the available capital funding, the number of large national projects under way, the cashflow requirements attaching to each project and the relevant priority.

Ireland signed OPCAT in 2007 but 12 years later, we have yet to ratify it, meaning that we are not bound to comply with its requirements.  When does Ireland plan to ratify this instrument?  In response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Clare Daly last week, the Department of Justice and Equality indicated that primary legislation will be required and that it will circulate a draft scheme to stakeholders before making a formal proposal to the Government this year.  The Government held a similar position, however, on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  In that case, it indicated that primary legislation would be required, but then decided to ratify it before the required legislative changes were enacted and progressed them after formal ratification.  Has the Minister of State considered whether this would also be an option in the case of OPCAT?  If the Department remains of the view that primary legislation is required, will the Minister of State provide more information on the status of the process?

As the Minister of State knows, groups working in the area are concerned at the pace at which the proposals are being advanced.  Therefore, as much detail as the Minister of State can provide would be appreciated.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State also knows, the key and most crucial part of the convention is the optional protocol which requires states parties to set up, designate or maintain at the domestic level one or several visiting bodies for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.  These are known as national preventative mechanisms.  States are required to provide those national preventative mechanisms with unfettered access to all places where persons are deprived of their liberty.  In light of the history in Ireland of unlawful detention and institutional abuse, including in the Magdalen laundries, we need to get the inspections process right.  Independent and regular inspections of institutions and care settings shine a light on otherwise hidden or closed spaces.  The nature of such spaces is a common thread in abuse.  We must also broaden our understanding of the deprivation of liberty beyond traditional detention settings like prisons and consider health and social care settings, immigration detention centres, direct provision centres, psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes.<\/p><p>The current system is in need of reform.  By ratifying OPCAT, we can introduce new inspection regimes and improve, reform and consolidate the existing ones.  I understand the Government is considering appointing a single body to conduct inspections in all deprivation-of-liberty settings.  Potentially, this may be the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  I ask the Government to consider alternatives to this option.  We need sector-by-sector mechanisms whereby those with experience and expertise conduct inspections within their own sectors.  For example, HIQA has expertise on health and social settings as the Ombudsman for Children has with child-related settings.  We need experts overseeing their own sectors to achieve real and effective oversight.  These individual sectoral mechanisms could then be co-ordinated by a single body, with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission being the obvious choice.  I am happy to work with the Minister on any of these proposals.  They are all practical and would see OPCAT implemented in Ireland to the highest possible standard.  I look forward to the reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#C00500","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who sends his regrets, I thank Senator Ruane for raising this important matter in the House.  We acknowledge also Senator Ruane's dedicated interest in this area and in respect of penal reform and detention generally.  It is an important issue which I hope she will continue to raise.<\/p> <p>As the Senator said, Ireland signed the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, or OPCAT, in 2007 but has yet to ratify the instrument.  The protocol is additional to the convention, which Ireland signed and ratified a number of years ago.  The Government is committed to the convention and has participated fully in everything its ratification entails.  The additional protocol is preventative in nature and provides for the establishment of national preventative mechanisms for the inspection of facilities where persons are held involuntarily.  While the Department of Justice and Equality has been tasked with progressing legislation to ratify the protocol, the instrument impacts on a number of sectors, including health, defence, children and youth affairs.  The Department has, therefore, consulted key stakeholders in 2018.  These stakeholders comprise those organisations with policy or operational responsibilities in respect of inspection arrangements across the ambit of the national preventative mechanism regime provided for in OPCAT.  As I stated, that goes beyond the justice sector.  In addition, stakeholders consulted include advisory and advocacy organisations with expertise in this area.  As part of this process, the Department has sought the views of stakeholders on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's 2017 research on the implementation of OPCAT in Ireland.  This welcome research led to the publication of a comprehensive report on the primary considerations for the State in making progress towards ratification and implementation of the protocol.<\/p> <p>The last submission in the consultation process was received in April 2018.  Since then, officials have met a number of stakeholders, including the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention who was appointed last year.  It is intended that the inspector and her office will have increased resources to carry out OPCAT-type inspections in the justice sector.  Late last year, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties held a round-table discussion on the implementation of the protocol.  Given the feedback at this discussion, it was decided that further consideration should be given to what organisation should carry out a co-ordinating role for national preventative mechanisms, including the option of appointing the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which Senator Ruane also suggests.  The Department is finalising the draft scheme of an inspection of places of detention Bill to provide for the ratification of OPCAT.  It is intended to provide in the Bill for a network of national preventative mechanisms in relevant sectors.  The Bill is intended also to provide for a co-ordinating mechanism to assist the sectoral bodies and liaise with relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the protocol.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In finalising the draft scheme, every consideration will be given to the proposals which were conveyed during the consultation process, including which organisation should co-ordinate the national preventive mechanisms, NPMs.  The Minister intends to circulate this scheme to stakeholders for their comments as soon as possible.

I am raising with him once again the schools building project status of St. Molaga&rsquo;s senior national school in Balbriggan, north County Dublin.  I have raised it before on several occasions, the last time being late September.  I am looking for an update on this project to see if we can keep it moving quickly through the system.<\/p> <p>As I have outlined on previous occasions, Balbriggan is the youngest and fastest growing town in Ireland.  St. Molaga&rsquo;s senior national school has served the town for a long number of years and has an excellent reputation.  However, it is in a difficult and unsatisfactory accommodation situation.  It has 466 pupils, 28 teachers, including the principal, Ms Pauline Costello, and six special needs assistants.  Approximately 60% of the school population is housed in 15 prefabs, many of which are 19 years old.  These prefabs are not fit for purpose.  They are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.  They are leaking and damp.  The children and the teachers are getting chest infections and these conditions are having a detrimental effect on those with asthma.<\/p> <p>Three of the prefabs were damaged during Storm Ali last September.  While they have since been repaired, the overall bad state of the prefabs is causing a big impact on the learning environment in the school.  The teachers, the principal and the special needs assistants are keeping standards high but it is a difficult task.  The pupils and staff of St. Molaga&rsquo;s and the people of Balbriggan deserve progress on this matter.  An extension to the school was approved several years ago which was welcomed.  However, it has taken a number of years to get to this point and patience is wearing thin.  Conditions are too difficult for this matter to go on any longer.  The project needs to be prioritised and fast-tracked.  That is why I am raising it here again with the Minister.<\/p> <p>This afternoon the Department of Education and Skills phoned the principal, Ms Pauline Costello, to let her know that the project manager framework is now completed, which is to be welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The next stage in the process is the appointment of a consultant design team.

A building project for this school is included in the Department's school building programme being delivered under the national development plan.  A project brief has been finalised and proposes a 16-classroom school, to include two special class teachers, eight special education tuition rooms and a two-class special education needs base.  The project will be delivered by the Department's accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme, an innovative, accelerated delivery programme first introduced by my Department in 2016.  It uses a professional, external project manager appointed to a selected programme of projects to co-ordinate and expedite the work of the respective design teams on each project.<\/p> <p>In this regard, a tender competition to establish a project manager framework is due to conclude on Wednesday, 10 April.

We will not be ready this September but I am conscious that schools want to work in as speedy a manner as possible.<\/p> <p>I am also conscious that we are dealing with many issues and difficulties with other schools in which things were done too quickly and with too much haste.  It is about getting the right balance to ensure the right custom-fit building for proper outcomes while also being very conscious of the structural and safety capabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#F00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I appreciate the point about buildings being in haste.

It is greatly appreciated.<\/p> <p>I rise to speak on behalf of four boys from Dublin's north side whose parents do not have a school place for them in September with the only reason being that these children have autism.  I refer the Minister to the report launched today from AsIAm entitled Invisible Children - Survey on School Absence and Withdrawal in Ireland's Autism Community.  I believe some representatives from the organisation are in the Public Gallery.  Some of the report's findings are quite stark and some of the representations made today were quite upsetting.<\/p> <p>It is a survey involving around 300 parents.  The findings showed that 35% said that they had applied to anywhere between four and seven different schools while seeking a place for their child.  A total of 54% of these parents felt that our lack of school places was the largest barrier for their child in accessing education, supported by a further 18% who said that the chief obstacle was a lack of nearby schools or classes in the local catchment areas.  When someone's child gets a diagnosis, what effectively happens is that he or she is handed a sheet of paper with a list of schools on it and told to do his or her best.  Some of the schools I spoke to parents about were in places as far away as Drogheda.  I will read into the record the names of the four children with whom I am dealing with currently.  They are Oliver Lynam, Mason Kelly, James Field, whose mother Alison spoke at the launch today, and Riley O'Keefe.  They have no place to go in September with the only reason being that they have autism.<\/p> <p>The manner in which we deal with these parents really needs to be investigated and improved.  We are giving a list of schools to a parent and telling him or her do his or her best.  While some schools will say \"Yes\", in this case most of them said \"No\".  I know we have the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which would challenge some of the attitudes displayed or responses given by some of the schools and I want to get the Minister's response to that.  <\/p> <p>The fall-back position, which the parents do not want because they want their children to go to a school setting, mix with other children and have that engagement, is the potential to home school the children but, again, parents are told to find a home school tutor themselves.  Unless we are professionals in the field, none of us is qualified to know what kind of home tutor will benefit our child.  <\/p> <p>Again, I talk to other parents who are on a very long waiting list to get assessments.  Today I spoke to another parent, Mark, about his daughter, Abigail, and how they have tried to get early intervention and have waited for effectively two and a half years to get it.  <\/p> <p>The Minister knows that once a parent gets a diagnosis, it is as if he or she must start waging a war with a system that should care for and be compassionate to him or her.  The parent faces a challenge with this diagnosis and a child he or she loves, cares for and wants to do his or her best for.  Simultaneously, the parent automatically becomes a kind of political campaigner, which is not the way it should be.  <\/p> <p>On behalf of those four children about whom I spoke, can the Minister give me and the parents some assurance that these children will have a school place in September?  We need a long-term conversation about how we deal with parents in this situation.  It probably falls between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, which is probably part of the difficulty but certainly the shocking experience these parents are going through has really come to light in the past number of months.  It is now April and will be May before too long.  These four children do not have a school place for September.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am sure there are hundreds of other parents in the same situation, as has been outlined by the report issued today and as has been reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>as recently as yesterday.

T&aacute;im oscailte maidir leis an chomhr&aacute; at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th i ndiaidh na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta inniu.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I value the Senator's observation that we need to look at the process and different ways that we can help in the process as well.  I am open to that idea.<\/p> <p>Enabling children with special educational needs, including autism, to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for Government.  At present, we are investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8 billion being spent annually, which is almost &euro;1 in every &euro;5, or 19% of the overall education budget.  This includes an allocation of over &euro;300 million towards providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools.<\/p> <p>Since 2011, the number of special classes has increased from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which almost 1,200 are autism special classes.  The National Council for Special education, NCSE, an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs.  The council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes.  It is open to any school to make application to the NCSE to establish a class.  When the NCSE sanctions the establishment of a special class or the expansion of special school provision in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and-or to construct additional accommodation.  Where families are experiencing difficulty in securing a placement for their child, it is recommended that they work closely with the NCSE's teams of locally-based special education needs organisers, SENOs, who will assist and advise them.  SENOs also support and advise schools.<\/p> <p>My Department has no role in seeking a suitable school placement for individual children.  Accordingly, I have arranged for the details of the four children provided by the Senator to be forwarded to the NCSE for its urgent attention.  The NCSE is aware of the recent demand for additional special class and special school placements in the Dublin area.  The council is actively engaging with schools, school patrons, parents, NEPS, health professionals and others who are involved in the provision of services for children with special educational needs to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to his or her needs for the 2019-20 school year.  This work is ongoing.  We are aware that enrolments in some schools have not yet been finalised for next year.  We expect a clearer picture to emerge in the coming weeks.  If additional places are required, the NCSE will work with schools and other stakeholders to ensure this need is met.  My Department is liaising closely with the NCSE in this regard.<\/p> <p>I reiterate this is a process.  It can be a difficult process for parents who have gone through preschool with their child and are ready to take that next step.  Like all parents, one likes to see a smooth transition, whether from preschool to primary or primary to secondary.  I believe in working together and the good work of the likes of the AsIAm group, which I met in the early days of my new post.  There are aspects that Government misses.  There are aspects that officialdom misses.  If there are gaps, I am certainly willing to work with the Senator in that regard.  We live in a special time where we are trying to include all our children.  Whether in special classes or in special schools or in the mainstream setting, that choice is so important.  It is important that we continue to work hard and focus on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#H00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I deeply appreciate the Minister's sentiments.<\/p> <p>I have a number of issues with the Minister's response, one being that the school can apply to the Department.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What happens if a school is not necessarily minded to apply?

We can see the difficulty.  The NCSE is acting against schools, school patrons, parents, NEPS and health professionals.  So many agencies are involved and parents go from one to the other to try to get a place for their children.  I appreciate that the Minister acknowledges there are gaps, that it is not good enough and that working together we can find solutions.  I appreciate that his official reply states a clearer picture will emerge in the coming weeks.  This is fair enough.  If we can discuss it again in a number of weeks' time we will have a clearer picture of where these four children are at and what the NCSE has come up with.  Certainly, the entire system needs to change to be an awful lot more sympathetic and to rally around these parents who receive a diagnosis.  Let us keep in contact and keep the conversation going.  What these parents are going through is not good enough and the Minister appreciates this.  He has also acknowledged that there are gaps, so let us work together to fill them and ensure the rights of the children I have named, Oliver, Mason, James and Riley, are vindicated and that they have a school place in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#H00300","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I am trying to evaluate the communication that takes place when SENOs give parents a list of potential schools.

She is now at a stage where she finds simple tasks like getting up, going to the bathroom or brushing her hair very difficult.  Spinraza is available in 20 other countries and anecdotally we have learned that Ireland has been offered this drug at a very competitive price.  The Department of Health says that it will cost &euro;20 million over five years which is a very small amount given the benefits of this drug.  Spinraza will not cure the young girl to whom I referred but it will massively improve her quality of life and &euro;20 million is a small price to pay for such an improvement.  I ask the Minister for Health to ensure that the HSE reaches a deal with the suppliers of Spinraza to ensure that children who need this drug have access to it.<\/p> <p>The second issue I raise today relates to the recently published report from the National Cancer Registry Ireland.  It found that cancer rates in Ireland could double over the next 25 years.  While cancer detection has improved and people are living a lot longer, it is frightening to think that cancer rates could increase by 50% in the years ahead.  As I said recently, almost every family in Ireland has been touched by cancer.  It does not discriminate on the basis of wealth or skin colour.  Unfortunately, it could hit any one of us and over the next few decades one in every two people in this country could be visited by cancer.  <\/p> <p>In 1996, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the first cancer strategy which was very successful.  There have been superb improvements in clinical outcomes but increases in the number of people diagnosed with cancer have led to delays in accessing chemotherapy.  In the past, when patients were diagnosed with cancer they started chemotherapy the very next day.  My own father suffered from cancer for 15 years.  He had several hundred blood transfusions and battled cancer successfully six times.  Each time he was diagnosed, he began chemotherapy the following day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Other members of my family have also been visited by cancer.  The waiting lists for chemotherapy, whether one is a public or private patient, mean that if one is diagnosed on a Monday, one may not be slotted in to start chemotherapy until three or four weeks later.  From my experience, I have seen that the time it takes to access cancer treatments has increased massively.  Whereas people used to get treatment the next day, they now wait a few weeks before being scheduled for chemotherapy.  We have a cancer strategy for the period from 2017 to 2026, which is very welcome, but in light of these figures it is really important that we ensure there is enough capital investment in, and Government support for, that strategy.  We are following this cancer strategy but we need to look at it again.  We need to revisit the issue of cancer care in Ireland.  We were once one of the best performers in this area but we are slipping.  People should not have to wait for chemotherapy.  The waiting lists for patients to be scheduled for chemotherapy should be much shorter than they are.  The statistics with which we have been presented today demonstrate that this will become an even greater problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#O00300","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I want to raise two matters today.

They are permitted in amusement arcades in places like Bray, Bundoran and the like because they were seen to be part of a culture of holiday entertainment.  That is the business of those local authorities, but it is scandalous that it will now be open season for gaming machines in Dublin city.  The experience of the British, particularly in respect of fixed-odds betting terminals, is that these machines visit total misery on people who become addicted to them.  I see that a maximum bet of &euro;10 on any occasion is proposed in the Bill.  This is wrong.  It will be a tax on the poor, the addicted and the vulnerable.  It will be an expropriation of their money to enrich people who add nothing to the sum total of human happiness.  I say that today in advance of any Second Stage consideration of this Bill, to which I am wholly opposed.  It is a step in the wrong direction.  For a Government that talks about local government reform to strip local government of this particular power is wholly wrong.  Surely it should be up to the people of Killarney whether their town has gaming machines and amusement halls.  It should be up to the people of Tralee to make the same kinds of decisions about their area.

All of those trolleys are lined up because we do not have enough front-line staff.  We just do not have enough staff to physically open the beds.  We do not have enough staff in accident and emergency units to do the treatments.  In some hospitals, three or four nurses are trying to cover the work of seven nurses.

She had a good career and worked for herself but was unable to continue to so do because of her condition and related matters.

Dr. Kidd has become a real leader in speaking out, especially for women in science and scientific research.  I was proud to also speak at the meeting Dr. Kidd spoke at last night, which was hosted by Women in Research Ireland.

I have been in contact with a number of school principals and staff across Roscommon and Galway whose schools are at risk of either losing a teacher or potentially closing due to decreasing pupil numbers.

Many of our schools are at full capacity and in need of expansion while just a few kilometres away other schools - many in rural areas - are at risk of closure.  I ask the Leader to have a debate in the Seanad on school transport, especially for rural areas.  There is a need for greater flexibility so we can use existing school resources to support our smaller rural schools and relieve pressure on those schools that are at full capacity.<\/p> <p>I attended a meeting last week with the school principal, school staff and parents at the Woodbrook national school just outside Carrick-on-Shannon in County Roscommon.  This school faces the problem of the lack of transport options.  Parents locally have committed to sending their children to the school but they need transport options to make it feasible.  It is a reality today that both parents work full time.  Families need access to pre-school services and after-school services and, therefore, need a more flexible transport system to allow them to support their local rural schools.

While many have questioned the motives of the postponement, I wish to raise a couple of alarming developments that are arising because nothing has been done about them.  While there will be no increase in the tax in the coming year, and first-time buyers remain exempt from the tax, those who bought in 2013 will be liable from this December.  Property tax is a massive issue.  Recently, good honest people came into my office who, because house prices had gone up, were afraid their house insurance would not cover them properly if their homes were undervalued.  Accordingly, they declared their houses to be worth more and Revenue now wants to back-tax them for being honest.  This is unacceptable.  Homeowners did not mean to increase their liability so it is unfair to ask them to pony up the back tax if their houses were never undervalued before this year.  There is a system to appeal against a liability when the price of a house has gone down but not when it has gone up.  More than 13,280 corrections to valuations have been made to Revenue, including 700 made last year.  This was done by honest people who are now all liable for back tax.  Were they unfairly penalised for coming forward?  Maybe some had incorrectly valued their property initially and are now looking to sell it.  What about those who have seen new value added to their homes?  All values are going up.<\/p> <p>My second point concerns people who, because of their means, could defer payment of the tax.  The deferrals will continue but the income thresholds were recommended to increase to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple, up from &euro;15,000 and &euro;25,000, respectively.  By keeping the threshold low, however, this Government is going to penalise fixed-income pensioners whose weekly payment has increased.  Since last week, a pensioner couple will earn &euro;25,800 and cannot now defer their payment.<\/p> <p>Both these issues seem so mean in our current climate and they are very unfair.  People are coming into my clinics with real concerns about them so I call on the Minister to come to the House to discuss these issues with me and Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#T00100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I am totally opposed to the Bill to amend the Act dealing with amusement trades, especially sections 12 and 13 of the new Bill.

On occasion, however, it is useful to stand up to welcome developments which will improve people's lives.  I refer specifically to the new arrangements the Minister for Health has made with doctors to allow many more services, including chronic illness care, to be provided in general practice settings.  The arrangements will cover things like diabetes, asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease, cardiovascular disease and heart failure, which is increasingly common as many of us, fortunately, are living into older years.  Something I have felt very strongly about will now be possible in general practice.  This involves the 8,000 patients in the general medical services, GMS, scheme with haemochromatosis, an iron metabolism disorder which requires them to have a pint of blood taken off at frequent intervals to protect their health.  Until now, this has been done in hospitals but it is well capable of being done in GP surgeries.  Indeed, some GPs have been doing it.  If one was a private patient, one could get it done, but as a GMS or uninsured patient, one could not.  This welcome news for 8,000 people speaks to the many other things that could be done in primary care but which are currently taking place in hospitals at great inconvenience for patients who must travel long distances.  It is also a cause of pressure on hospital services.<\/p> <p>I welcome this deal and use the opportunity to call for further diagnostic services in general practice.

It would allow GPs like me to diagnose and treat our patients in the community, never having to send them to hospital at all.  It would be much more convenient for patients and provide great job satisfaction for doctors.

Currently, both counties are served by Tearmann Domestic Abuse Service.  I acknowledge the great work it does on behalf of unfortunate individuals who find themselves in need of help in such circumstances.  Tusla is in the process of reviewing domestic violence services across the country.  Based on information I have received from Tearmann and others, there is a need for a dedicated refuge for people who find themselves in such a difficult and stressful domestic situation.  There is also clearly a need for increased resources in this particular area.  Last year, for example, the service supported 260 people, mostly women but some men.  It is important to remember that this support also involved over 400 children.  We all know that domestic violence and marriage breakdown are traumatic for those involved, particularly children.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to expedite the review and ensure that additional resources are made available to those who find themselves in such difficult, dangerous and traumatic circumstances?

This is the eighth theft of an ATM in Northern Ireland and there have been many more in Cavan and Monaghan.  What is happening?  Do the banks put tracker devices on these ATMs?  The robberies are a significant inconvenience to staff and customers, as well as putting fear into communities.  I cannot understand how a digger can be brought up a street in a small village on a Saturday night, rip apart a cash machine in a garage and nobody seems to know anything about it.  I am not a detective.  However, in this day and age, do these cash machines not have tracking devices attached to them?  As Bertie Ahern rightly stated, it is not the boy scouts who are doing this.  It is believed that dissident republicans are responsible.  This is a worrying trend.  If it were to happen in every town and village, there would be no cash machines left at all.

It occurs in urban areas but particularly in rural areas.  I keep seeing photographs on Facebook of local election candidates and sitting councillors who have been canvassing somewhere and there are 50 black bags in a field which have sometimes been set on fire.  I do not know whether an industry is involved and people are collecting this waste from houses and dumping it, or whether it involves people disposing of their private waste.   I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come and discuss this topic in this House as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>Illegal dumping seems to be rampant across the country.  I know there is an issue of people dumping in urban areas.  Sometimes people move out of houses and 100 black bags and various other items are discovered in the back garden.  I often see bags that are full of cans, bottles and paper, all of which can be recycled for free.  It may be that the civic centres and recycling facilities to which people can bring such items are a long way away but education is probably needed.  Maybe waste collectors are very expensive and that is an issue.  <\/p> <p>We need to survey households to see where their waste is going.  Many people responsibly dispose of their rubbish through a door-to-door collector or go to civic recycling facilities.  My former local authority, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which covers the area in which I live, is winning awards for having good recycling centres.  I am sure most local authorities have very good recycling centres but there will be a residual amount of waste that is not recyclable.  We need to try to reduce that as much as possible by examining what packaging is permitted to be recycled and what is not because illegal dumping is a scourge right across the landscape.  I saw a Tidy Towns clean-up in Ballybrack in Dublin which, very easily and quickly, produced hundreds of bags and that is a relatively urban area where waste collection is available.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the waste market as soon as possible.  I am not giving out about waste collectors which do their job well, by and large.  There are certainly people who are not using these services and are not disposing of their waste responsibly by other means.  We need to look at what can be done about that.  The practice of people throwing sofas, electronic equipment and black bags into hedges during the night must not be allowed to continue.

The information I have is that the HSE wrote to the company informing it of its proposal to refuse reimbursement of Spinraza at the price offered by the company but allowing for an opportunity for the company to come back to the HSE with a different price option.  As Members will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 allows for 28 days during which a company may come back to the Department or the HSE.  My information is that the HSE has received a revised submission.  The HSE drugs group is now considering that price and will make a recommendation.  I do not have more up to date information than that but drugs companies have an obligation to come back to the HSE with reasonable prices so that we can ensure people are able to avail of medicines.  <\/p> <p>Senators McFadden and Ardagh raised the report from National Cancer Registry Ireland.  According to the report, one in two of us will develop cancer in the coming years.  As Senator McFadden rightly said, outcomes have improved and people are surviving longer and have better access to treatment and medicines but it is important that we invest in cancer care and services, the national cancer strategy is updated and resources put in place to ensure the strategy is fit for purpose.  Last Friday, I visited Cork ARC Cancer Support House to look at its proposal for the new development, which involves a suite of rooms and treatment centres and would provide people with an opportunity to meet.

He is also correct that it is the most vulnerable and those who can least afford it who end up going in to these places.  I fully subscribe to the point made by Senators McDowell and Lawless that gambling is a scourge on many families from which no community is immune.  I support Senator McDowell's view that it does not add anything to society to have places where gaming machines are operated.<\/p> <p>In the context of any legislation, it is important that we do not remove power from local authorities.

Senator McDowell will be glad to hear I agree with him.  None of us in this House is anti-Semitic or anti-Israel.  From the point of view of what is being proposed here, it is a free and democratic election.  Like Senator McDowell, I do not take my lead on Israel or Palestine from President Trump but it is important that we have a sensible debate.  In fairness, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have taken a strong line on Israel and Palestine.  I am not sure the Bill to which the Senator refers is a good one but it was passed in this House.  It is important that the Israeli people have their vote today.  It is equally important that the world community upholds human rights.  Like the Senators, I believe in the rights of Israel but I also believe the Palestinian people have a fundamental right that we must all try to honour as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of trolleys in hospitals, which are a source of concern.  We have seen HSE investment in initiatives to target waiting times in emergency departments.  The Senator also referred to staff recruitment.  It is important to recognise that the Government has in recent years provided capacity to recruit more doctors and nurses to work in the health system.  Since 2015, the number of medical and dental staff has increased by 1,132 or 12%, the number of nurses has increased by 2,291 or 6.4% and the number of health and social care professionals has increased by 1,918 or 13%.  The number of health service staff in management and administration increased by 2,340 or 14% in the same period.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that there is a need for more investment in front-line services and I share Senator Reilly's view that a greater emphasis on primary care is needed.  The Government, as Senator Reilly noted, has agreed a new GP contract which will make general practice a much more attractive career and allow for treatment at the first point of care.  I thank all those involved in the contractual discussions that have taken place.<\/p> <p>HSE recruitment needs to be targeted at specific areas.  This year, we have the highest health budget in the history of the State.  I am sure some Senators watched the \"Reeling in the Years\" programme the other night in which an infamous Minister for Health, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was shown presiding over the highest ever trolley watch figures.

In County Mayo, we have seen many objections to infrastructural projects and many other projects, which has held them up.

The delays, however, have cost taxpayers millions of euro.  In the Ballina electoral area alone, millions of euro have been spent and nothing has been done because of objections.  I am not saying any or all of those objections relate to natural heritage areas.  <br\/><br\/>I have proposed this amendment because we should put many things aside for the benefit of the community.  The Minister should have the power, as stated in section 18A(5)(<i>b<\/i>), to take an area out of an NHA if it is an enhancement of or benefit to the community, or a benefit to an infrastructure project such as a major road scheme.  I am supported by Senators Mulherin, O'Mahony and &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  I have no doubt the Minister is well aware of how community projects and various other projects can be held up because part of a project is in an NHA.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.

I support the amendment for those reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#DD00300","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Burke on certain matters but I cannot support this amendment.  There is already provision in the Bill for designation by the Minister.  Environmental criteria can be considered in addition to national, regional, and local economic, social and cultural needs.

The real concern here is that there is still a frame of mind that regards our bogs, not only raised bogs but also blanket bogs, as being somehow empty space.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Our bogs are doing work.  They are already of major benefit to a community and, indeed, the wider community.  In fact, it is those limited areas that do the work given that Ireland does not have national forestry in the same way as other areas and does not have some of the other environmental carbon sequestration reports.  The bog network already holds up our environment and ecosystems.  Our bogs do that work.<\/p><p>I have a number of concerns about this amendment.  I recognise that there are certain elements within this amendment that may well make a case for greenways.  Let us consider the unfortunate loss of our railways such as the railway line from Galway to Clifden, which the Minister of State will be very familiar with, and the strong case that has been made for decades for the line to become a greenway.  One of the things that greenways do is engage with the balance of the ecosystem and environment.  Unfortunately, the greenways have been stuck right alongside golf courses, which have been recognised internationally as something that we simply cannot afford to continue in the same way.  Ireland has many golf courses and some very famous people own golf courses in Ireland.  We have a green environment and so forth, but golf courses have an environmental impact.  Some that have already been established may be maintained but they need to be in balance.<\/p><p>Bogland, particularly blanket bogland, is very saturated with water.  The environmental impact required to turn waterlogged blanket bogland into a golf course is immense.  It not only does damage in terms of carbon but it does damage in terms of water retention, the water table and the flood plain.  There is also a huge issue with the amount of pesticides and water needed for golf courses.  We have well-established golf courses where the work has already been done.  I understand that they may wish to be maintained but we give them too much privilege.  The Minister of State may recall or perhaps it was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, that I raised concerns about retaining the lower and more preferential VAT rate for members of golf clubs.  In fact, we raised the issue for a number of other areas, including community exhibitions and local art centres.  There are questions about how preferential a tax treatment we need to give to golf courses.  We certainly do not want a situation whereby a willingness to turn large tracts of land into a golf course is enough to justify dedesignation.  Unfortunately, that would be the effect of putting this section here because it goes into a section that says \"notwithstanding 18(3)\".  So, notwithstanding the other considerations and all of the work that we have done and discussed in terms of other areas, there are real questions here.<\/p><p>I encourage the Minister of State not to accept the amendment because he can assure all in the House that in considering national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs, he has enough room.  What is important about where they are currently placed in the Bill is that they are required to be set against the environment considerations rather than be a stand-alone provision on their own.  I encourage those who proposed the amendment to consider tabling separate amendments on some of the different activities because there is a big difference between a greenway and a sports field, and a sporting project in a general sense or a strategic infrastructural project.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Minister of State will recall our discussion on blanket bogs.  Perhaps we will have a chance to return to this matter again.  He referenced the fact that it had already been discussed and debated on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Since our debate I checked to see exactly what was debated in the D&aacute;il.  What I found was that the case being made for many years for the dedesignation of blanket bogs was one where we have been trying to build a road through the heart of Connemara and designation has been a problem.  I would ask the following when we say strategic infrastructural projects are enough of a reason to dedesignate a bog.  Would a road through the heart of Connemara be considered a strategic infrastructural project that may benefit from this new loophole?  I note that the Minister of State's colleague, the then Minister in charge of this area, Deputy Heather Humphreys, said that the Minster should not have \"power to dedesignate an NHA without having carried out preparatory scientific analysis\".  We have discussed the fact that that has not been done yet and, indeed, that it would not send out a good signal for how we protect bogs and heritage areas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would not send out a good signal in how we protect bogs and heritage areas.  There are not simply environmental issues in this.  This is a matter of joined-up thinking.  We know the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is under review.  We know Ireland will have to make its case under a new and stringent set of rules as to how we meet our targets and what will be ever more specific targets in respect of the CAP, greening and so forth.  Much of this bogland does overlap, as was discussed the last day, with farmlands and lands owned by others who will be seeking subsidies under the CAP.  For them with bogland that is protected and suitably cared for, it will strengthen their case, as well as the case for communities and for Ireland.  On a pragmatic level, leaving aside the environmental benefits, there are significant economic benefits from our boglands.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister of State not to accept this amendment.  I know those putting it forward have done so in good faith.

I refer to claims that this amendment would add something to the Bill.  It would not.  It is subtracting from the Bill.  The crucial issue is that what it proposes would be inserted after the phrase \"notwithstanding section 18(3)\".  Section 18 sets out the rules by which a bog is designated.  The purported purpose of this Bill is to set out the rules for designation and de-designation of natural heritage areas.  The impact of what is proposed would be that the Bill would state that the Minister may, notwithstanding the reasons listed in section 18(3), namely, \"environmental criteria, restoration potential and national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs\" de-designate on the basis of those reasons listed in the amendment, which does not contain any text in respect of the environment.  With respect, Senator Hopkins, this is not about balance.  This amendment would remove balance.  It would literally remove the words \"environmental criteria\" from consideration in the context of a decision to de-designate in these circumstances.  If this amendment was a supplement to section 18(3) rather than being a way to circumvent its provisions, I would have no problem supporting it.  It would be the same if the amendment referred to national, regional and local community, economic, social and cultural needs.  We could have a definition of \"community\" inserted after the phrase \"national, regional and local\".  It is important to state that not accepting this amendment would not mean that it will be impossible to undertake projects relating to infrastructure or greenways.  It means that when a decision is being made, it will be balanced against the environmental criteria.<\/p> <p>An example would be the western rail corridor .  That project was on the cards for a long time.  Unfortunately, the Government removed it from our national development strategy, even though we had potential for co-funding from Europe.  If we had a western rail corridor that went through the bogs, it would be possible to make the case that it has social, community and regional benefits and connects places in the area.  It would also contribute to carbon reduction and, therefore, balance the environmental criteria.  That project would probably be successful under the criteria already contained in section 18(3).  The position relating to greenways is similar.  It would certainly be possible to have infrastructure.  It is necessary to ensure, however, that the case for it is made and that the same balance outlined in the Bill is maintained.<\/p> <p>I do not like the way in which environmental criteria are defined.  The Minister of State knows that and we will have a chance to debate the matter later.  The important point, however, is that there was at least an acknowledgement of the environment.  We are simply creating a loophole if we accept this amendment.  Is a hotel with a golf course attached going to be considered a community benefit?  Will the Minister of State or any of the proposers of the amendment guarantee that this will not lead to another set of hotels?  We have seen the pressure on building and how the rules need to be relaxed even in the city of Dublin.  What buildings were erected after those rules were changed, however?  We have seen hotels.  Community centres have been mentioned.  I would love a strategy for community centres.  I would support it and it would fulfil the criteria.

As the Minister of State knows very well, there is a committee of local people who have been lobbying to improve and tarmacadam the road between Galway and Clifden to make it safer.  That committee has been on the go for four of five years.  All the people want is a proper road for their community.  The amendment proposed by Senator Paddy Burke and others tries to create a balance and give greater opportunity and clarity for the Minister and his team in the Department to take decisive action.  This is important.  I trust the Minister of State and the Department to do this.  This is what we do when we support or challenge the Government.  It is not an individual thing, it is collective.<\/p> <p>Approximately two weeks ago, there was a programme on TG4 about Rosmuc.  I do not know whether Senator Warfield saw it.  The captain of the girls' football team teaches in Dublin and drives all the way to Rosmuc to train with the team of seven or eight girls.  I played on that football pitch.  It was a bog.  If it had not been turned into a football pitch, we would not have the soul of that community.<\/p> <p>A point was made about hotels in Dublin.  There are many more vacant houses in the middle of Mayo, Roscommon and Connemara than there are hotels.  Nobody will build a hotel where it is not financially viable to do so.  Certainly the hotels in the middle of Connemara, Mayo, Roscommon and the midlands are struggling to survive.  The current tiger, whatever we call it, is fine for Dublin and those of us living here but it has not reached the parts of Ireland it needs to.  The amendment is important to put the local community back in the centre.  It is like the advertisement at Christmas about a dog being not just for Christmas.  Connemara is not just for holidays.

The primary purpose of any review of national heritage areas must be with regard to nature conservation, in terms of maintaining bog habitats at, or restoring bog habitats to, a favourable conservation status.  The area of any new proposed national heritage area network should contribute to the national conservation objective target area of a bog within special areas of conservation and national heritage area networks.  Additional bog habitat in the national heritage area network would make a contribution to the overall objectives of the habitats directive to maintain or restore the habitat to favourable conservation status.<\/p> <p>The Bill strikes a balance between the need to protect the environment, live up to our EU obligations and work with landowners and turf cutters on whose lives these obligations can have a very real impact.

This is always a balance that needs to be struck.<\/p> <p>With regard to the comments of Senator Higgins, I mentioned the criteria last week and I will read them into the record again.  The principles and criteria in the Bill are to guide the Minister on conducting a review and making decisions, such as the carrying out of strategic environmental assessments, public consultations and linking the achievement of major conservational objectives for blanket bog habitats to the favourable conservation status of these habitats.  Any of the designations we speak about would be in this vein also.

Amendment No. 9 again relates to the conversation we have been having about community.  We all have a sense of what a community is but we need to be clear on certain things such as the phrase &quot;the common good&quot;.  As Senator Norris pointed out quite eloquently, the common good is mentioned in our Constitution and is recognised as being for the benefit of all those who live within the State.  Amendment No. 9 seeks to build on the provision whereby the Minister, when he or she has made an order to de-designate lands as a natural heritage area, will &quot;place an advertisement in at least one newspaper circulating in the locality in which the land to which the order applies is situate to inform the public of the making of the order&quot;.  My amendment simply provides that he or she will also place an advertisement in a national newspaper to inform the public of the making of the order.  Such orders are not only a matter for those whose lands adjoin the natural heritage area, NHA.  They affect all of us.  They affect our environment.  Many will have strong relationships and opinions on this issue.  The obligation to place an advertisement in respect of the de-designation of an NHA in a national newspaper - which again is a decision the Minister makes on behalf of the nation - is in line with the constitutional point made in respect of the common good.  It is a reasonable proposal.<\/p><p>In amendment No. 11 I suggest that in addition to sharing a copy of the order with the various bodies mentioned in the Bill - the planning authorities, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and so forth - a copy also be shared with the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I do not believe anybody would object to that committee having the opportunity to examine this issue.  I reserve the right to suggest a copy also be shared with other committees, given that new committees have emerged since I tabled these amendments.  It is important that cross-party committees are aware of such orders and have the opportunity to discuss them if they so choose.  I also suggest that, in addition to a copy of the order being sent to these bodies directly, a copy should be published online.  Perhaps the Minister of State has suggestions as to the appropriate place to publish such orders online.  Out of duty to the general public, they should be available online.<\/p><p>In amendment No. 10 I suggest that a copy of the amendment be sent to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#JJ01600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The amendment proposes to delete \"(b) cause\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#JJ01700","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Yes, it proposes \"to delete &ldquo;(b) cause&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(c) cause&rdquo;.\" because I have proposed a new section 18A(6)(b).

In amendment No. 17 we are suggesting, where land is de-designated and is no longer an NHA, that without prejudice to turbary rights for household use, commercial harvesting should not be permitted.  I have been very clear that I support turbary rights but there are intergenerational justice issues involved here, not simply in terms of climate change and the damage we have done to the planet, the consequences of which young people will have to live with.  Even within turbary rights and within families, there are intergenerational justice issues.  Turbary rights are deep and historical and like seaweed harvesting rights are traditional rights associated with household use.  We are talking about the cutting of turf for household use, to which I am not opposed.  Turbary rights are important which is why these amendments seek to protect them.  However, there is a problem in that we do not have a definition of household use.  The intergenerational justice issues are not simply around climate change, carbon emissions or the injustice that has brought young people onto the streets in Ireland and around the world.  The equivalent of what five generations would have cut in the past is being cut by one generation through the use of industrial machinery.  We are seeing the cutting of turf on a scale that is purely commercial.  We need to find a balance in terms of protecting turbary rights for future generations.  That does not mean a blank cheque or a blank slate that tells people they can do as they wish.<\/p> <p>We passed a Bill on fossil fuel divestment in these Houses and we know that we are coming to the end of the fossil fuel era.  Why, in that context, would we continue to encourage and open up new areas for commercial turf cutting?  My fear is that we are entering a period where we have a \"last orders\" mindset, where people try to commercially cut as much as they possibly can in the time remaining.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is why my preference is that, after areas are de-designated as natural heritage areas, turbary rights continue and are protected but commercial harvesting of turf is not allowed.<\/p><p>I have a strong preference for amendment No. 17, which calls for a complete end to commercial turf cutting in natural heritage areas after they are de-designated.  However, the intent behind amendment No. 18 is even harder to disagree with.  The amendment states that commercial harvesting shall not be permitted beyond 2030, which is the target date by which Bord na M&oacute;na has committed semi-State and State bodies to ending commercial harvesting of peat and ceasing its use as a fuel.  It is very reasonable to ask that the same standard apply in respect of these privately-owned lands which are going to be de-designated.  If the plan is for the State to move out of this area after 2030, that is too far away.  I would prefer it to be 2025 because 2030 is the year when scientists tell us it will be too late to stop extracting.  The 11 or 12 years we have left on climate change are not years in which to get around to changing what we do.  They are the years in which we need to repair the damage that has been done if we are going to save our planet.  It is a minimum standard that privately-owned bogs are not cut commercially when the State stops commercially cutting for fuel in 2030.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 17 strikes a better balance because it respects turbary rights.  If amendment No. 17 is accepted, grandchildren may be able to get turbary rights on the de-designated bogs and keep the connection with the land.  That means not giving it all away in one go and managing it responsibly.

My grandfather and all his ancestors had turbary rights and used them.  In the 1950s, I remember going down to Laois and there was a particular point on the Limerick Road where one would start to get the smell of turf, which gave me to start thinking I was nearly home.  I love the smell of turf.  There is something quite characteristic about it and I have an enormous wicker basket full of hand-cut turf in my house at the moment.

In that regard the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has made supplementary regulations to provide that large-scale peat extraction, which involves an area of 30 ha or more, will be an activity controlled by licensing by the EPA.  The regulations came into force on 25 January 2019.<\/p> <p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has also recently advised that the development of a new regulatory framework for smaller-scale peat extraction, that is, in respect of areas below 30 ha, will be initiated and progressed.  Planning permission is generally considered to be required under the Planning and Development Acts for developments such as domestic turf cutting in a new or extended area of 10 ha or more where the drainage of the bogland commenced on or after 21 January 2002.

I know many people with less than 10 ha, although that does not mean there is no commercial usage.  Another approach might be to outlaw certain kinds of machinery.  I will not suggest people go back to using the slean to cut turf but sausage machines are used in small areas and move from area to area and such machinery may be rented for a period.  The Minister has indicated that areas of 5 ha, 6 ha or 7 ha may be the ones to be de-designated but if they become a patchwork of areas for harvesting, there is a problem.  These are key questions and the Minister needs to have the information about these areas if he is giving himself the power to make decisions about de-designation while balancing community, social, environmental and cultural factors.  We discussed the scientific information he will need but he also needs regulatory information.  The environmental impact of de-designation is different as between one which comes under a regulatory framework and one which does not.  The regulatory framework matters, as we discussed in the context of the pollinator plan.<\/p> <p>The Minister said a regulatory framework was being developed but I am sure he will see that there is an area of concern with that so we need a lot more clarity about what the framework will look like.  The Minister may be able to achieve the goals without using such a bald term as \"commercial turf harvesting\", for example, by indicating what forms of harvesting are appropriate.  This comes back to the question of turbary rights and what we define as household use, recognising that households are different.  It is not simply a free-form interpretation.  When we de-designate a bog under 10 ha and state that it is no longer a natural heritage area, it should not fall into being an area of unregulated usage.

As initiated, the Bill proposed to amend Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution to reduce the time period that spouses applying for a divorce must have lived apart from at least four years during the previous five years to at least two years during the previous three years.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, under Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution, as amended by the 15th amendment in 1995, a court may grant a divorce only where specific conditions have been met.  The first condition is that on the date of institution of the divorce proceedings, the spouses have lived apart from each other for a total of at least four years during the previous five years.  The second condition is that there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation between the spouses.  The third condition is that proper provision exists or will be made for the spouses and any children of either or both of them.  The final condition is that any further conditions prescribed by law are complied with.<\/p> <p>We must remember that in 1995, we were moving from a situation where the Constitution provided clearly that no law could be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage to one in which divorce was to become possible for the first time, but subject to very specific conditions which were set out in the new provision inserted by the 15th amendment.  The purpose of the mandatory period of living apart was to ensure that divorce would not be available on an easy or casual basis, to address concerns about what were described as \"quickie divorces\" and the development of what was described as a divorce culture in Ireland.  The four-year period was intended to ensure that spouses would not enter into divorce lightly and would have the necessary time to reflect on the serious step they were undertaking.  It was also considered that it would encourage spouses to attempt to reach agreement on the terms of their separation in a way that would ensure that when the divorce application came before a court, many of the key elements relating to children, finance and property might already have been settled between the spouses and a form of agreement reached.  The four-year period of living apart can be accumulated over a five-year period, the reason for which is to allow a couple to make a reasonable attempt at reconciliation in the knowledge that if it does not work out, they will not have lost their option to make an application for divorce.<\/p> <p>The Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, which followed the 15th amendment to the Constitution, made provision for the exercise by the courts of the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution to grant decrees of divorce and enabled the courts to make certain preliminary and ancillary orders in or after proceedings for divorce.  It is now 23 years, however, since divorce was introduced in Ireland and the four-year minimum living apart period is now perceived to be unnecessarily restrictive and to hinder couples who have separated from regularising their legal positions and, in many respects, moving on with their lives.  Ireland has one of the lowest divorce rates in Europe and that is to be welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Sadly, however, some marriages break down irreconcilably, causing immense sadness and stress for everybody concerned.  It is my desire, and the Government wishes to ensure, that the process for obtaining a divorce is fair, dignified and humane and allows for both parties to move forward with their lives within a reasonable timeframe.  The Government has taken the opportunity, presented by this Private Member's Bill to re-examine the provisions of Article 41.3.2o of the Constitution and consider the question of the scope of the constitutional amendment that might be proposed.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, in this regard.  Following analysis, legal advice and consultation with all sides in the Oireachtas, the Government considers that removing the living apart period from the Constitution so that it could be dealt with in ordinary legislation by the Oireachtas would be a more appropriate means to address the complex area that is involved here.<\/p><p>The Government is proposing an amendment to the Constitution to remove the four-year minimum living apart period from Article 41.3.2o.  It is also proposing an amendment to replace the text of Article 41.3.3o, which deals with the recognition of foreign divorces with a new provision.  The Bill was amended on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to provide for these amendments.  It is the intention of the Government, subject to the passage of the Bill by the D&aacute;il and Seanad, to hold a referendum on divorce alongside the votes for the European and local elections on Friday, 24 May 2019.  It is with that in mind that I ask for the co-operation of the House at least in debating the issue.  I assure Senators that I would be very happy to debate the issues, but if we are going to have quorums called on the whim of an individual Senator, then it is likely to frustrate the debate.  I ask for the co-operation and understanding of all Senators in that regard, although I am not holding my breath. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#MMM01000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>There is no need for that.

In accordance with the 1998 Act, the Chief Justice has nominated Ms Justice Tara Burns to act as chairperson to the commission.  I believe it is important to have broad consensus in the Oireachtas for any proposal that will be put to the people.  Having engaged in consultations with parties and political groupings on options for the scope of the constitutional amendment that might be proposed, I would like to acknowledge the broad cross-party support in the Oireachtas for the proposed changes.  In this regard, I acknowledge the constructive approach of the Fianna Fail, Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in parties and I would hope that during this debate we might be in a position to allay any fears, queries or observations that some of the Independent grouping might have.<\/p><p>Section 1 makes provision for amendments to Article 41 of the Constitution.  Paragraphs <i>(a)<\/i>and<i>(b)<\/i>propose the repeal of paragraph i of Article 41.3.2<sup>o<\/sup>of the Constitution.  Paragraphs <i>(c) (d)<\/i>and <i>(e)<\/i>provide for the consequential renumbering of the remaining paragraphs of Article 41.3.2<sup>o<\/sup>.  The effect of the amendment would be that the Constitution would no longer provide for a minimum living apart period for spouses who wish to apply for a divorce but that such a period could be defined in law by the Oireachtas.  Removing the time period from the Constitution would give the Oireachtas a greater element of flexibility to legislate to ease the burden on people who have experienced the tragedy of a marriage breakdown and wish to begin again.  As it stands the long period of living apart required under the Constitution frequently leads to couples seeking a judicial separation prior to obtaining a divorce with attendant legal costs, additional upset, stress and worry.<\/p><p>Should the referendum be passed, it is the intention of the Government to deal with the living apart period by way of ordinary legislation.  In this regard the Government will bring forward a Bill to amend section 5(1)<i>(a)<\/i>of the Family Law Divorce Act 1996 to reduce the minimum living apart period specified in that Act to two years during the previous three years.  Senators will be aware that I published the draft general scheme of a Bill to provide for this.  This reduction of the time would enable couples whose marriages have broken down with no reasonable prospect of reconciliation to regularise their affairs sooner.  A shorter living apart period would also have the potential to reduce the legal costs involved as couples would be less likely to need to apply for a judicial separation or make a formal separation agreement, while waiting to become eligible to apply for a divorce.<\/p><p>Over time we have learned that complex questions of social policy are best dealt with through detailed legislation in the Oireachtas rather than in our Constitution.  The fundamental principles and protections concerning divorce will not change and the Government is not proposing any changes to the other provisions in Article 41.3 of the Constitution.  I note that Senator Ruane is smiling and I note her concern in this regard.  We will have an opportunity to debate it.  I do not disagree with much of what the Senator has said outside the House, but I am keen to try to achieve consensus on the question that might be put to the people with a view to gaining the approval of the people.  The requirement that there be no prospect of reconciliation, therefore, will remain in the Constitution.  The requirement that proper provision exists or will be made for spouses and children will continue in the constitutional framework but also remain the case that only a court of law will be in a position to grant a divorce.  The Law Reform Commission, LRC, has included in its fifth programme of law reform an examination of the proper provision requirement for divorce.  It has indicated that it will consider to what extent any further guidance may be provided to ensure a consistency in the approach taken to the exercise of this judicial discretion, in particular to assist spouses to reach settlements and resolve disputes more efficiently and at a lower financial cost.<\/p><p>Turning now to paragraphs<i>(f) <\/i>and <i>(g) <\/i>of section 1 and the Schedule to the Bill, what is proposed is an effort to modernise the provision on recognition of foreign divorces in Article 41.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>of the Constitution.  The Government is proposing that Article 41.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>be replaced with a more modern readily understandable provision, which clearly provides that the Oireachtas may legislate for the recognition of foreign divorces granted under the civil law of another State.  The proposed new text will do no more than to set out in express terms what the courts have found to be the present state of the law; however, to ascertain the present state of the law, it is necessary to examine the case law on the interpretation of Article 41.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>.  The constitutional position regarding the recognition of foreign divorces should be clear from a reading of Article 41 of the Constitution.  Currently, different rules apply to the recognition of foreign divorces, depending on whether for example they are granted within the European Union or outside the EU.  The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 governs the recognition of a divorce granted in a country outside of the European Union.  This 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce which would be granted after the Act came into operation may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in a country where either spouse was domiciled on the date upon which the divorce proceedings were instituted.  In this regard, it is important to note that recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the commencement of the 1986 Act is governed by common law domicile rules, which are now consistent with those in the 1986 Act.  The determination of domicile, includes an assessment of the person's intention to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This has proved complex to determine over the years in some instant cases.  By contrast, a test of habitual residence, which may be considered less complex and more clear, generally applies across the European Union.  EU Council Regulation 2201\/03, known as Brussels IIA regulation, governs the recognition of divorces obtained in another EU member state.  Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition of such a divorce.  In this regard, I advise the House that the Law Reform Commission, LRC, has proposed to examine the legal issues relating to the recognition of foreign divorces as part of its new fifth programme of law reform after the referendum.  I intend to legislate to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces and will be guided by the expert report of the LRC in developing proposals for legislation in this area.  <\/p><p>The language of Article 41.3.3o which deals with the recognition of foreign divorces is consistent with a time in our history when divorce was expressly prohibited under our Constitution.  The referendum in May, if we manage to reach that deadline, is an opportune moment to modernise this provision<\/p><p>.  Section 2 provides for the title of the proposed amendment of the Constitution and the Short Title of the Bill.  This section was amended on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il in order to change the Short Title of the Bill to the, \"the Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Bill\".  If passed by the people in the referendum, the amendment will be known as the thirty-eighth amendment of the Constitution.  These changes take account of the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2018 and the Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of Offensive Publication or Utterance of Blasphemous Material) Act 2018, which were approved by the people in referendums since this Bill was first introduced.  The purpose of the change in the Title of the Bill, to use the phrase \"dissolution of marriage\" rather than \"divorce\", is to better reflect the wording of Article 41 of the Constitution.<\/p><p>The aim of the amendments proposed in this Bill is to decrease the burdens on people whose marriages have, sadly, broken down.  Ultimately, if the Bill is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the people will have their say by way of referendum.  I know the Irish people are very compassionate and will show empathy and understanding to those who find themselves in the desperately sad situation of a marriage broken down and with no prospect of reconciliation.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#NN01400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here this afternoon.

This will be the third time the electorate will be asked a question on divorce and, hopefully, the last.  It is sometimes a sad thing and sometimes a joyous thing when a marriage breaks down and a divorce is required but the State needs to facilitate an accessible route to dissolution of marriage where it is needed.  The civil aspects of a marriage are a significant legal and binding contract and people need to be able to enter and leave these contracts to ensure the emotional and familial stress and burden that the breakdown of a marriage can have on individuals and those close to them is eased and that the State is not unnecessarily adding to the distress of our citizens.<\/p><p>I welcome that the decision of Government was made to further liberalise the provisions of the Private Members' Bill introduced by the now Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, when she was a backbencher.  It is right to take cumbersome, detailed and technical provisions out of the Constitution so that we in the Oireachtas can do our jobs and legislate for these complex issues.  It is important that we do not have to go back to the people for another referendum any time a change needs to be made and so such changes can be dealt with in the much more flexible legislative process.  It was the right decision so I thank the Minister for advocating for this change.  <\/p><p>It is welcome that this Bill recognises that the Constitution is not the right place where complex issues of family law are set out and regulated.  Constitutional provisions are supposed to set broad principles that give us the environment within which the Oireachtas can write and pass laws.  As we saw with our recent experience with the eighth amendment, ambiguous language can have wide-ranging and unintended consequences and make it very difficult for the Judiciary to interpret it fairly and for the Oireachtas to legislate as it needs to.  I mention all this because, while I welcome the proposal to repeal paragraph (1) of Article 41.3.2<sup>o<\/sup>, I am concerned that the rest of the article is being left untouched.  The Minister is aware of the remaining provisions in paragraph (2), which refers to a grant of divorce when &quot;there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses&quot; and paragraph (3), which refers to &quot;such provision as the court considers proper, having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses, and children or either or both of them, and any other person prescribed by law&quot;.  Essentially those provisions require that a judge must be satisfied that the couple are not going to reconcile and that proper financial provision has been made for spouses, dependants and children before he or she will be granted a divorce.  This is a high legal bar to meet and, while I am not making a judgment on their merits, I am raising my concern that they will remain in the Constitution.  <\/p><p>In a column for <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>in February this year, professor of law at Trinity College, Mr. David Kenny, raised significant concerns with the decision to limit this referendum to just the issue of time limits and I thank him for engaging with my office on this issue last week.  He wrote that the requirement for proper provision means that, where possible, assets will be divided so that spouses and children can continue to enjoy the lifestyles they had during the period of marriage and that it will always be possible be revisit this at a later date.  This means that, long after a marriage has ended, a judge may still inquire into the finances of former spouses and keep proposing new divisions of assets.  This effectively means that, even after a divorce in Ireland, there could be no clean break.  I am again not making a judgment on the merits of the provision at this stage because I have not been able to do enough of my own research and I am just querying whether this complex provision should remain in the Constitution or whether it should be dealt with in legislation.<\/p><p>Mr. Kenny then refers the no prospect of reconciliation provision and how, because the time limit has always been there, the time requirement has essentially done that job for the judge concerned because to live apart for so long can be, and in most circumstances is, determined as proof in and of itself of the unlikelihood of reconciliation.  However, once the time limit is presumably removed, a judge may feel he or she needs to inquire into the reconciliation prospects more actively and vigorously.  Perhaps judges will need more detail on the reason for the breakdown of the marriage and the circumstances thereof, greatly increasing the distress of the individuals involved but also moving us to a new situation wherein, although Ireland currently has a system of no-fault divorce whereby one does not need a specific reason to get a divorce, this could change in the future.  <\/p><p>I am not making a judgment on the merits of these provisions at this stage.  I am just asking the question as to whether they should remain in the Constitution or whether they should be taken out and dealt with in legislation.  Did the Minister consider these issues when drafting the constitutional amendment?  I know he referred to his own agreement, in a sense, in his contribution.  What were the results of those discussions?  These are complex provisions that impact on the intimate relationships of people living in Ireland and I am not convinced that those provisions should remain as they are.  It would be a real shame if we missed an opportunity here to deal with this issue conclusively and had to come back for a fourth divorce referendum.  I raise these issues with the hope of being constructive.  I am, unfortunately, not able to stay until the end of the debate but I will read the Minister's response and may debate the matter further with him on the next Stage on Thursday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#OO00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Changes in the rules relating to divorce are afoot in England and Wales so this debate is timely.  This morning's headlines were about reform to end the blame game between couples who are divorcing in Britain.  It is currently the case that fault-based divorces, where there are allegations of adultery or unreasonable behaviour, take as little as three to six months to be completed.  However, no-fault divorces can take much longer because couples have to prove they are living apart for at least one year in Scotland and two years in England, though certainly not the four-year term currently required in Ireland.  The point is to change the rules so that couples will only have to state that marriage has broken down irretrievably.  Furthermore, the rule change will prevent one partner refusing a divorce if the other one wants it although currently in England such a situation only affects 2% to 3% of divorcees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ian Marshall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Most of these changes are aimed at reducing stress and acrimony and allowing a time of reflection.

Finding fault, apportioning blame and having to prove a separation of two or five years were not seen as helpful.  Furthermore, the justice system first and foremost attempts to resolve issues in a non-confrontational way.  It is with this in mind that I support the Government's proposed amendments to the Constitution, especially as they are based on there being no reasonable prospect of reconciliation between the spouses.  Having considered all circumstances, including children and others under any other conditions proscribed in law or complied with, anyone dealing with divorces will testify that no one enters into divorce proceedings lightly and very few come through them unscathed.  The amendments are reasonable and do not in any way undermine or devalue the sanctity of marriage.

We welcome the Bill and the referendum more broadly to reduce the waiting period that a separated couple must undergo before a couple may be granted a divorce.  We recognise, as we did during the original divorce referendum in 1995, the reality that some marriages break down over time and the sad fact that this breakdown is sometimes irreparable.  There are also other reasons.  Article  41.3.2&deg;, as it currently stands, is very restrictive and is not fair to those who seek to divorce.  It creates even more hardship and difficulty in what can be an already difficult experience.  The experience of the eighth amendment illustrates that it is unwise to specify complex social policies in the Constitution and that these matters should be governed by ordinary primary legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will give this Bill consideration in due course and we may seek to amend it as it progresses.  However, I will not put the cart before the horse.  I am willing to see the outcome of the referendum, which I hope will pass with a substantial majority.<\/p> <p>There is a distinction to be drawn between contested and uncontested divorce.  In uncontested cases, the requirement for a long separation period is likely to be unnecessary.  However, where one spouse opposes the application, it is common practice in other common law jurisdictions that a period of separation would be considered proof that the marriage has broken down irreparably.  The Minister informed my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, that this would not be an issue but I remain unconvinced about this.  If a referendum were to pass and a two-year waiting period were introduced, it strikes me that it will be arduous for a couple, for instance, in a case where the relationship is still amicable, if, after agreeing to file for a divorce and go their separate ways after six months, they would be required to wait a further 18 months to seek a formal separation.  I am not stating that the two-year waiting period should be disregarded but, rather, I would like to open a discussion on whether it is necessary in the first place.<\/p> <p>As I stated, we will examine the legislation carefully and the possibility distinguishing in legislation between uncontested and contested cases in the hope that any legislation would be cognisant of both types of cases and would not treat them as being the same.  In those circumstances, the commitment and love between two people required to sustain a marriage is no longer present.  It is simply inhumane to require these persons to continue to be bound by a legal partnership that both want to leave.  The electorate agreed with this view and passed the divorce referendum in 1995.  The Constitution's outright ban between 1937 and 1995 did not serve society well.  It did not serve those who were legally trapped in marriages which they did not want to be part of either.<\/p> <p>We recall the strong resistance to the proposed divorce referendum by some organisations which insisted that the introduction of divorce in Ireland would open the floodgates to marital breakdown.  This has clearly not happened.  There were already thousands of separated persons in this jurisdiction before divorce was introduced.  The current waiting period is not acceptable.  No one seriously considers that it should take grown adults four years to decide whether they want to divorce.  What is the point in forcing people to wait a long time before they can divorce, especially when many of them form relationships and have children with others in the intervening years?  We need to trust adults to make the best decisions for themselves, their families and relationships.  On that basis, Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the Bill and will support the referendum in May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#PP00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this proposed amendment to the Constitution.  It is a change which is required.  I will raise some points for consideration based on my experience of dealing with the family law courts.  Some people have used the courts system to delay the process of separation and divorce.  For instance, I am aware of one case which has been ongoing for 18 years.  The initial matter was one of judicial separation.  The response of the other party was to apply for an annulment and constantly move legal offices.  The party then applied to the court on the basis that they were entitled to qualify for legal aid.  The case was dealt with in the Circuit Court and was subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court.  An appeal to the High Court was lost and it then went to the Supreme Court.  There is now a third judicial review.  The courts must have a mechanism to deal with this.  It is unfair to the party on the other side and to the court system that a case can take such a long time when it is clear that a marriage has broken down and the parties want to go their separate ways.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the case to which I refer, there is no finality 18 years later.  I note that this legislation deals with a different issue, but I ask the Minister to look at the kind of complications I am talking about, namely, how the court system can be used in the wrong way and a person can benefit from that.  That matter needs to be looked at, in particular in regard to judicial review and the situation whereby an initial application is made by one party and the other party then applies for an annulment.  It is an issue about which I am very concerned.  There is much undue delay in family law as a result of the process not being tied down.<\/p><p>Obviously, the right way, and the advice I would give to anyone who comes to me and says his or her marriage has broken down and he or she wants a separation or a divorce, is to go into mediation and try to come to a compromise and reach agreement.  There are only two beneficiaries in judicial separation or divorce proceedings in the courts and those are the lawyers on both sides.  I openly give that advice to people, but some people prefer to go down the road of court proceedings and that process needs to be tightened up.  In reviewing this whole issue, the State solicitor's office, the Department and the Office of the Attorney General should look at the issues I have raised because they are of serious concern to me and it is important that the current situation not be allowed to continue.  I welcome the proposal brought forward by the Minister and I hope that the electorate will vote for the required change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#PP00400","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I believe that my colleague and friend, Senator Norris, called a quorum in order to ensure that there was a sufficient number of Senators present for this important Bill.  I am grateful to him for doing so because it enabled me to get here in time for the start of the debate.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I am delighted to welcome this important Bill and the practical and compassionate reform of the Constitution it proposes.  Like other Senators, I acknowledge the work of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, in highlighting the need for this reform and taking the initiative on it.  As Senators are aware, the amendment proposed in the Bill would, if passed, delete the first paragraph of the current text of Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution and the requirement that spouses must have lived apart for at least four out of the previous five years before seeking a divorce.  Like Senator Ruane, I was struck by the argument of my colleague, Professor David Kenny.  Perhaps we ought to be more bold in seeking to amend the Constitution.  It might have been preferable - I will not put it any more strongly than that at present - to have simply put forward an amendment in line with that on the eighth amendment last year which would enable the Oireachtas to make provision for dissolution of marriage without specifying particular aspects.  I make that point somewhat tentatively because I very much support the current text of paragraph (iii) of the article, which requires that the court ensure that proper provision is made for spouses and children.  That is an important text.  Nevertheless, we should be able to provide in law for clean-break divorces, whether through legislation and the current text of the Constitution or through amending the Constitution.  That need is increasingly pressing.  I listened to the comments of Senator Colm Burke about delay of the court processes and so on.  We should be able to provide for that issue.<\/p> <p>I will return to the issue of the time limit and how we might amend that legislation.  I am grateful that the Minister published the scheme of the Bill.  It is very useful that he did so and it is important that people would know the consequences of a \"Yes\" vote.  If the amendment passes on 24 May, we will have time to debate that Bill further.  I and others may propose different time limits, possibly based on the time limits used in other European countries.  For example, in some jurisdictions there may be a one-year limit proposed or, indeed, no waiting period or a six-month period where there is mutual consent.  We could look at mechanisms other than the two out of the three previous years formula currently proposed in the scheme of the Bill.<\/p> <p>On the referendum, I wish to address the track record of the Labour Party in driving social change on marriage.  As Members are aware, the 1986 referendum driven by the Labour Party in coalition government with Fine Gael was lost in spite of the \"Yes\" side having an initial lead in the polls.  Of course, retrospectively it seems that the referendum was lost largely due to fears about property division and adequate provision for dependent spouses.  Following that defeat, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989 dealt with some of the issues around property division and provision for spouses and children.<\/p> <p>The second divorce referendum, held on 24 November 1995, was another intensely fought campaign.  The Minister may have been less than bold in the proposal for the amendment because these referendum campaigns can be difficult and highly contested.  Along with my colleagues in the Labour Party, I took an active role in the 1995 referendum.  Of course, it was driven by the then Minister and member of the Labour Party, Mervyn Taylor, as well as activists in the Divorce Action Group and the Right to Remarry campaign which rightly focused on the need to ensure that people whose marriages had already broken down would be able to get a second chance, regularise their new relationships and provide adequately for any children of a successive relationship.  Despite this very compassionate and persuasive message based on humanity, the fifteenth amendment of the Constitution was only very narrowly passed by 50.28% of the electorate, a figure etched in the memories of all those who campaigned at the time.  There was a margin of only 9,114 votes, which is sometimes attributed to heavy rain in the west of Ireland on the day the referendum took place.  I jest.  It was an extremely tight margin.  Of course, fears were stoked during the campaign by dire warnings from the \"No\" side that marital breakdown rates would escalate, dreadful slogans such as \"Hello Divorce ... Bye Bye Daddy\" and posters bearing messages such as \"Divorce aborts marriage\".  I recently looked back at some of those dreadful slogans.  Those fears and messages obviously contributed to the low margin of success in 1995 in spite of the fact that we had, of course, been making very strong arguments that legalising divorce simply recognised a reality and did not condone or encourage marital breakdown in any way.<\/p> <p>Once the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 was put in place, many of us were concerned about the highly restrictive language in the Constitution which restricted the nature of the legislation.  However, we acknowledged that the Act allows for no-fault divorce and that is welcome because other systems which earlier introduced divorce earlier based their laws on fault-based grounds.  It is positive that Ireland did not so do.  As many commentators and experts have pointed out, a fault-based system tends to place more strain on families in the event of break-up.  Indeed, in spite of the dire predictions, our divorce rate has remained low since divorce was legalised, with a crude divorce rate of 0.7% compared with a European average of 1.9% when measured as divorce rates per 1,000 persons.  Not only have marriage rates in Ireland remained strong, the number of those who can marry was expanded following the very welcome result in the 2015 referendum on marriage equality.  The dire predictions did not come to pass.<\/p> <p>There has been significant case law in the application of the Divorce Act, with clear rulings on the need to ensure that proper provision is made for dependent spouses and children and liberal interpretations of the term \"living apart\" to ensure that persons are not required to live in separate premises or households once they are effectively living apart, even if that is under the same roof.  In spite of that liberal interpretation, commentators such as Carol Coulter and others have pointed out that the mandatory four-year period continues to present serious and unnecessary obstacles to couples whose marriages have broken down, that this period is one of the longest provided for in any jurisdiction and that it has forced many couples into a cumbersome two-stream legal procedures whereby they must seek a judicial separation in order to regularise their situation in an existing marital breakdown while waiting for the requisite four years to pass in order to be able to seek a divorce.<\/p> <p>For those practical reasons as well as the reasons of  compassion and humanity that applied in earlier referendums, this is a very important referendum and I will be campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote on 24 May along with my Labour Party colleagues, in keeping with our tradition of supporting important liberal social reforms.  I welcome that the Minister has appointed Ms Justice Tara Burns to the commission and that the referendum date is set.<\/p> <p>On marriage reform, I am very proud of two enacted reforms to marriage law which I was involved in initiating.  One is the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012 which enabled the conduct of legal secular wedding ceremonies by humanist celebrants.

The outcome of this examination will inform future proposals.  I am not sure it would be prudent to propose an amendment to the proper provision requirement in advance of that examination by the LRC.  In response to Senators Ruane and Bacik, it is my considered view at this stage that the remaining provisions in the Constitution are there for a very good reason, namely, the matter of the court order, the fact that an order will only be granted on the basis of there being no prospect of reconciliation and that proper provision be made for spouse and children.<\/p> <p>At the heart of the proposal by Government is a desire to ease the burden on people whose marriages have broken down.
