In 2017 the Minister, Deputy Harris, visited St. John's and acknowledged that he could see the need for the 120 beds to be replaced.  My question is whether St. John's Hospital will be included in the capital plan.  University Hospital Limerick is in the news all the time in respect of its beds and its bed capacity.  While 60 modular beds have been started, it will be a while before they will be opened.  We need to start planning for the future.  Attendance numbers are up at both University Hospital Limerick and St. John's Hospital.  St. John's Hospital is a minor injuries clinic but it does some day procedures and if it received 120 replacement beds on a permanent basis, it would be able to carry out more procedures and deal with more minor injuries.  This would alleviate the pressure on University Hospital Limerick.  The beds need to go ahead at the same time as in University Hospital Limerick because we need to alleviate the pressure.  People come from all over the mid-west and Nenagh Hospital is now carrying out cataract operations but we need St. John's Hospital and University Hospital Limerick to deliver at full capacity to meet the needs of the mid-west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#B00400","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue and I commend her on her work to drive the project at St. John's Hospital.  I know she has a particular interest in it and that she is very committed to the people of Limerick.  It also gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the proposed capital development of a 120-bed ward to replace the existing ward accommodation at St. John's Hospital, Limerick.<\/p> <p>St. John's is a model 2S voluntary hospital within the University of Limerick hospitals group covering Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary.  The hospital currently has 88 inpatient medical beds and ten beds for day surgery.  It also provides a medical assessment unit, a minor injuries unit and five-day surgery to the people of the region.  I understand the current proposal is for a 120-bed replacement ward block, consisting of four units of 30 single rooms for inpatient ward accommodation.  Progress in respect of these and all other capital projects are subject to the availability of capital funding.  All healthcare infrastructure developments, including this development, must comply with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines and EU directives and will require a lead-in time to complete the various stages of public capital projects.  These stages include appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, detailed design, some of which may overlap, the review of costing estimates and the finalisation of financing.<\/p> <p>The national development plan, NDP, announced last year as part of the Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative, provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care.  The delivery of NDP projects and programmes, including developments in Limerick, will result in healthcare facilities that allow for implementation of new models of care and for delivery of services in high-quality modern facilities.  The revised health capital allocation in 2019 is &euro;642 million for the construction and equipping of health facilities.  The Department and the Health Service Executive are currently engaged in a process to finalise the HSE capital plan for 2019.  In developing its capital plan for 2019 and future years, the HSE must consider a range of issues, including the expenditure that is contractually committed, the HSE's annual requirement in relation to meeting risks associated with clinical equipment, ambulances and healthcare infrastructure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The HSE capital plan will propose the projects that can be progressed in 2019 and beyond, having regard to the available capital funding, the number of large national projects under way, the cashflow requirements attaching to each project and the relevant priority.

Ireland signed OPCAT in 2007 but 12 years later, we have yet to ratify it, meaning that we are not bound to comply with its requirements.  When does Ireland plan to ratify this instrument?  In response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Clare Daly last week, the Department of Justice and Equality indicated that primary legislation will be required and that it will circulate a draft scheme to stakeholders before making a formal proposal to the Government this year.  The Government held a similar position, however, on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  In that case, it indicated that primary legislation would be required, but then decided to ratify it before the required legislative changes were enacted and progressed them after formal ratification.  Has the Minister of State considered whether this would also be an option in the case of OPCAT?  If the Department remains of the view that primary legislation is required, will the Minister of State provide more information on the status of the process?

As the Minister of State knows, groups working in the area are concerned at the pace at which the proposals are being advanced.  Therefore, as much detail as the Minister of State can provide would be appreciated.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State also knows, the key and most crucial part of the convention is the optional protocol which requires states parties to set up, designate or maintain at the domestic level one or several visiting bodies for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.  These are known as national preventative mechanisms.  States are required to provide those national preventative mechanisms with unfettered access to all places where persons are deprived of their liberty.  In light of the history in Ireland of unlawful detention and institutional abuse, including in the Magdalen laundries, we need to get the inspections process right.  Independent and regular inspections of institutions and care settings shine a light on otherwise hidden or closed spaces.  The nature of such spaces is a common thread in abuse.  We must also broaden our understanding of the deprivation of liberty beyond traditional detention settings like prisons and consider health and social care settings, immigration detention centres, direct provision centres, psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes.<\/p><p>The current system is in need of reform.  By ratifying OPCAT, we can introduce new inspection regimes and improve, reform and consolidate the existing ones.  I understand the Government is considering appointing a single body to conduct inspections in all deprivation-of-liberty settings.  Potentially, this may be the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  I ask the Government to consider alternatives to this option.  We need sector-by-sector mechanisms whereby those with experience and expertise conduct inspections within their own sectors.  For example, HIQA has expertise on health and social settings as the Ombudsman for Children has with child-related settings.  We need experts overseeing their own sectors to achieve real and effective oversight.  These individual sectoral mechanisms could then be co-ordinated by a single body, with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission being the obvious choice.  I am happy to work with the Minister on any of these proposals.  They are all practical and would see OPCAT implemented in Ireland to the highest possible standard.  I look forward to the reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#C00500","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who sends his regrets, I thank Senator Ruane for raising this important matter in the House.  We acknowledge also Senator Ruane's dedicated interest in this area and in respect of penal reform and detention generally.  It is an important issue which I hope she will continue to raise.<\/p> <p>As the Senator said, Ireland signed the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, or OPCAT, in 2007 but has yet to ratify the instrument.  The protocol is additional to the convention, which Ireland signed and ratified a number of years ago.  The Government is committed to the convention and has participated fully in everything its ratification entails.  The additional protocol is preventative in nature and provides for the establishment of national preventative mechanisms for the inspection of facilities where persons are held involuntarily.  While the Department of Justice and Equality has been tasked with progressing legislation to ratify the protocol, the instrument impacts on a number of sectors, including health, defence, children and youth affairs.  The Department has, therefore, consulted key stakeholders in 2018.  These stakeholders comprise those organisations with policy or operational responsibilities in respect of inspection arrangements across the ambit of the national preventative mechanism regime provided for in OPCAT.  As I stated, that goes beyond the justice sector.  In addition, stakeholders consulted include advisory and advocacy organisations with expertise in this area.  As part of this process, the Department has sought the views of stakeholders on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's 2017 research on the implementation of OPCAT in Ireland.  This welcome research led to the publication of a comprehensive report on the primary considerations for the State in making progress towards ratification and implementation of the protocol.<\/p> <p>The last submission in the consultation process was received in April 2018.  Since then, officials have met a number of stakeholders, including the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention who was appointed last year.  It is intended that the inspector and her office will have increased resources to carry out OPCAT-type inspections in the justice sector.  Late last year, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties held a round-table discussion on the implementation of the protocol.  Given the feedback at this discussion, it was decided that further consideration should be given to what organisation should carry out a co-ordinating role for national preventative mechanisms, including the option of appointing the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which Senator Ruane also suggests.  The Department is finalising the draft scheme of an inspection of places of detention Bill to provide for the ratification of OPCAT.  It is intended to provide in the Bill for a network of national preventative mechanisms in relevant sectors.  The Bill is intended also to provide for a co-ordinating mechanism to assist the sectoral bodies and liaise with relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the protocol.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In finalising the draft scheme, every consideration will be given to the proposals which were conveyed during the consultation process, including which organisation should co-ordinate the national preventive mechanisms, NPMs.  The Minister intends to circulate this scheme to stakeholders for their comments as soon as possible.

I am raising with him once again the schools building project status of St. Molaga&rsquo;s senior national school in Balbriggan, north County Dublin.  I have raised it before on several occasions, the last time being late September.  I am looking for an update on this project to see if we can keep it moving quickly through the system.<\/p> <p>As I have outlined on previous occasions, Balbriggan is the youngest and fastest growing town in Ireland.  St. Molaga&rsquo;s senior national school has served the town for a long number of years and has an excellent reputation.  However, it is in a difficult and unsatisfactory accommodation situation.  It has 466 pupils, 28 teachers, including the principal, Ms Pauline Costello, and six special needs assistants.  Approximately 60% of the school population is housed in 15 prefabs, many of which are 19 years old.  These prefabs are not fit for purpose.  They are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.  They are leaking and damp.  The children and the teachers are getting chest infections and these conditions are having a detrimental effect on those with asthma.<\/p> <p>Three of the prefabs were damaged during Storm Ali last September.  While they have since been repaired, the overall bad state of the prefabs is causing a big impact on the learning environment in the school.  The teachers, the principal and the special needs assistants are keeping standards high but it is a difficult task.  The pupils and staff of St. Molaga&rsquo;s and the people of Balbriggan deserve progress on this matter.  An extension to the school was approved several years ago which was welcomed.  However, it has taken a number of years to get to this point and patience is wearing thin.  Conditions are too difficult for this matter to go on any longer.  The project needs to be prioritised and fast-tracked.  That is why I am raising it here again with the Minister.<\/p> <p>This afternoon the Department of Education and Skills phoned the principal, Ms Pauline Costello, to let her know that the project manager framework is now completed, which is to be welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The next stage in the process is the appointment of a consultant design team.

A building project for this school is included in the Department's school building programme being delivered under the national development plan.  A project brief has been finalised and proposes a 16-classroom school, to include two special class teachers, eight special education tuition rooms and a two-class special education needs base.  The project will be delivered by the Department's accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme, an innovative, accelerated delivery programme first introduced by my Department in 2016.  It uses a professional, external project manager appointed to a selected programme of projects to co-ordinate and expedite the work of the respective design teams on each project.<\/p> <p>In this regard, a tender competition to establish a project manager framework is due to conclude on Wednesday, 10 April.

We will not be ready this September but I am conscious that schools want to work in as speedy a manner as possible.<\/p> <p>I am also conscious that we are dealing with many issues and difficulties with other schools in which things were done too quickly and with too much haste.  It is about getting the right balance to ensure the right custom-fit building for proper outcomes while also being very conscious of the structural and safety capabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#F00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I appreciate the point about buildings being in haste.

It is greatly appreciated.<\/p> <p>I rise to speak on behalf of four boys from Dublin's north side whose parents do not have a school place for them in September with the only reason being that these children have autism.  I refer the Minister to the report launched today from AsIAm entitled Invisible Children - Survey on School Absence and Withdrawal in Ireland's Autism Community.  I believe some representatives from the organisation are in the Public Gallery.  Some of the report's findings are quite stark and some of the representations made today were quite upsetting.<\/p> <p>It is a survey involving around 300 parents.  The findings showed that 35% said that they had applied to anywhere between four and seven different schools while seeking a place for their child.  A total of 54% of these parents felt that our lack of school places was the largest barrier for their child in accessing education, supported by a further 18% who said that the chief obstacle was a lack of nearby schools or classes in the local catchment areas.  When someone's child gets a diagnosis, what effectively happens is that he or she is handed a sheet of paper with a list of schools on it and told to do his or her best.  Some of the schools I spoke to parents about were in places as far away as Drogheda.  I will read into the record the names of the four children with whom I am dealing with currently.  They are Oliver Lynam, Mason Kelly, James Field, whose mother Alison spoke at the launch today, and Riley O'Keefe.  They have no place to go in September with the only reason being that they have autism.<\/p> <p>The manner in which we deal with these parents really needs to be investigated and improved.  We are giving a list of schools to a parent and telling him or her do his or her best.  While some schools will say \"Yes\", in this case most of them said \"No\".  I know we have the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which would challenge some of the attitudes displayed or responses given by some of the schools and I want to get the Minister's response to that.  <\/p> <p>The fall-back position, which the parents do not want because they want their children to go to a school setting, mix with other children and have that engagement, is the potential to home school the children but, again, parents are told to find a home school tutor themselves.  Unless we are professionals in the field, none of us is qualified to know what kind of home tutor will benefit our child.  <\/p> <p>Again, I talk to other parents who are on a very long waiting list to get assessments.  Today I spoke to another parent, Mark, about his daughter, Abigail, and how they have tried to get early intervention and have waited for effectively two and a half years to get it.  <\/p> <p>The Minister knows that once a parent gets a diagnosis, it is as if he or she must start waging a war with a system that should care for and be compassionate to him or her.  The parent faces a challenge with this diagnosis and a child he or she loves, cares for and wants to do his or her best for.  Simultaneously, the parent automatically becomes a kind of political campaigner, which is not the way it should be.  <\/p> <p>On behalf of those four children about whom I spoke, can the Minister give me and the parents some assurance that these children will have a school place in September?  We need a long-term conversation about how we deal with parents in this situation.  It probably falls between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, which is probably part of the difficulty but certainly the shocking experience these parents are going through has really come to light in the past number of months.  It is now April and will be May before too long.  These four children do not have a school place for September.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am sure there are hundreds of other parents in the same situation, as has been outlined by the report issued today and as has been reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>as recently as yesterday.

T&aacute;im oscailte maidir leis an chomhr&aacute; at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th i ndiaidh na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta inniu.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I value the Senator's observation that we need to look at the process and different ways that we can help in the process as well.  I am open to that idea.<\/p> <p>Enabling children with special educational needs, including autism, to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for Government.  At present, we are investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8 billion being spent annually, which is almost &euro;1 in every &euro;5, or 19% of the overall education budget.  This includes an allocation of over &euro;300 million towards providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools.<\/p> <p>Since 2011, the number of special classes has increased from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which almost 1,200 are autism special classes.  The National Council for Special education, NCSE, an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs.  The council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes.  It is open to any school to make application to the NCSE to establish a class.  When the NCSE sanctions the establishment of a special class or the expansion of special school provision in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and-or to construct additional accommodation.  Where families are experiencing difficulty in securing a placement for their child, it is recommended that they work closely with the NCSE's teams of locally-based special education needs organisers, SENOs, who will assist and advise them.  SENOs also support and advise schools.<\/p> <p>My Department has no role in seeking a suitable school placement for individual children.  Accordingly, I have arranged for the details of the four children provided by the Senator to be forwarded to the NCSE for its urgent attention.  The NCSE is aware of the recent demand for additional special class and special school placements in the Dublin area.  The council is actively engaging with schools, school patrons, parents, NEPS, health professionals and others who are involved in the provision of services for children with special educational needs to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to his or her needs for the 2019-20 school year.  This work is ongoing.  We are aware that enrolments in some schools have not yet been finalised for next year.  We expect a clearer picture to emerge in the coming weeks.  If additional places are required, the NCSE will work with schools and other stakeholders to ensure this need is met.  My Department is liaising closely with the NCSE in this regard.<\/p> <p>I reiterate this is a process.  It can be a difficult process for parents who have gone through preschool with their child and are ready to take that next step.  Like all parents, one likes to see a smooth transition, whether from preschool to primary or primary to secondary.  I believe in working together and the good work of the likes of the AsIAm group, which I met in the early days of my new post.  There are aspects that Government misses.  There are aspects that officialdom misses.  If there are gaps, I am certainly willing to work with the Senator in that regard.  We live in a special time where we are trying to include all our children.  Whether in special classes or in special schools or in the mainstream setting, that choice is so important.  It is important that we continue to work hard and focus on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#H00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I deeply appreciate the Minister's sentiments.<\/p> <p>I have a number of issues with the Minister's response, one being that the school can apply to the Department.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What happens if a school is not necessarily minded to apply?

We can see the difficulty.  The NCSE is acting against schools, school patrons, parents, NEPS and health professionals.  So many agencies are involved and parents go from one to the other to try to get a place for their children.  I appreciate that the Minister acknowledges there are gaps, that it is not good enough and that working together we can find solutions.  I appreciate that his official reply states a clearer picture will emerge in the coming weeks.  This is fair enough.  If we can discuss it again in a number of weeks' time we will have a clearer picture of where these four children are at and what the NCSE has come up with.  Certainly, the entire system needs to change to be an awful lot more sympathetic and to rally around these parents who receive a diagnosis.  Let us keep in contact and keep the conversation going.  What these parents are going through is not good enough and the Minister appreciates this.  He has also acknowledged that there are gaps, so let us work together to fill them and ensure the rights of the children I have named, Oliver, Mason, James and Riley, are vindicated and that they have a school place in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#H00300","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I am trying to evaluate the communication that takes place when SENOs give parents a list of potential schools.

She is now at a stage where she finds simple tasks like getting up, going to the bathroom or brushing her hair very difficult.  Spinraza is available in 20 other countries and anecdotally we have learned that Ireland has been offered this drug at a very competitive price.  The Department of Health says that it will cost &euro;20 million over five years which is a very small amount given the benefits of this drug.  Spinraza will not cure the young girl to whom I referred but it will massively improve her quality of life and &euro;20 million is a small price to pay for such an improvement.  I ask the Minister for Health to ensure that the HSE reaches a deal with the suppliers of Spinraza to ensure that children who need this drug have access to it.<\/p> <p>The second issue I raise today relates to the recently published report from the National Cancer Registry Ireland.  It found that cancer rates in Ireland could double over the next 25 years.  While cancer detection has improved and people are living a lot longer, it is frightening to think that cancer rates could increase by 50% in the years ahead.  As I said recently, almost every family in Ireland has been touched by cancer.  It does not discriminate on the basis of wealth or skin colour.  Unfortunately, it could hit any one of us and over the next few decades one in every two people in this country could be visited by cancer.  <\/p> <p>In 1996, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the first cancer strategy which was very successful.  There have been superb improvements in clinical outcomes but increases in the number of people diagnosed with cancer have led to delays in accessing chemotherapy.  In the past, when patients were diagnosed with cancer they started chemotherapy the very next day.  My own father suffered from cancer for 15 years.  He had several hundred blood transfusions and battled cancer successfully six times.  Each time he was diagnosed, he began chemotherapy the following day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Other members of my family have also been visited by cancer.  The waiting lists for chemotherapy, whether one is a public or private patient, mean that if one is diagnosed on a Monday, one may not be slotted in to start chemotherapy until three or four weeks later.  From my experience, I have seen that the time it takes to access cancer treatments has increased massively.  Whereas people used to get treatment the next day, they now wait a few weeks before being scheduled for chemotherapy.  We have a cancer strategy for the period from 2017 to 2026, which is very welcome, but in light of these figures it is really important that we ensure there is enough capital investment in, and Government support for, that strategy.  We are following this cancer strategy but we need to look at it again.  We need to revisit the issue of cancer care in Ireland.  We were once one of the best performers in this area but we are slipping.  People should not have to wait for chemotherapy.  The waiting lists for patients to be scheduled for chemotherapy should be much shorter than they are.  The statistics with which we have been presented today demonstrate that this will become an even greater problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#O00300","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I want to raise two matters today.

They are permitted in amusement arcades in places like Bray, Bundoran and the like because they were seen to be part of a culture of holiday entertainment.  That is the business of those local authorities, but it is scandalous that it will now be open season for gaming machines in Dublin city.  The experience of the British, particularly in respect of fixed-odds betting terminals, is that these machines visit total misery on people who become addicted to them.  I see that a maximum bet of &euro;10 on any occasion is proposed in the Bill.  This is wrong.  It will be a tax on the poor, the addicted and the vulnerable.  It will be an expropriation of their money to enrich people who add nothing to the sum total of human happiness.  I say that today in advance of any Second Stage consideration of this Bill, to which I am wholly opposed.  It is a step in the wrong direction.  For a Government that talks about local government reform to strip local government of this particular power is wholly wrong.  Surely it should be up to the people of Killarney whether their town has gaming machines and amusement halls.  It should be up to the people of Tralee to make the same kinds of decisions about their area.

All of those trolleys are lined up because we do not have enough front-line staff.  We just do not have enough staff to physically open the beds.  We do not have enough staff in accident and emergency units to do the treatments.  In some hospitals, three or four nurses are trying to cover the work of seven nurses.

She had a good career and worked for herself but was unable to continue to so do because of her condition and related matters.

Dr. Kidd has become a real leader in speaking out, especially for women in science and scientific research.  I was proud to also speak at the meeting Dr. Kidd spoke at last night, which was hosted by Women in Research Ireland.

I have been in contact with a number of school principals and staff across Roscommon and Galway whose schools are at risk of either losing a teacher or potentially closing due to decreasing pupil numbers.

Many of our schools are at full capacity and in need of expansion while just a few kilometres away other schools - many in rural areas - are at risk of closure.  I ask the Leader to have a debate in the Seanad on school transport, especially for rural areas.  There is a need for greater flexibility so we can use existing school resources to support our smaller rural schools and relieve pressure on those schools that are at full capacity.<\/p> <p>I attended a meeting last week with the school principal, school staff and parents at the Woodbrook national school just outside Carrick-on-Shannon in County Roscommon.  This school faces the problem of the lack of transport options.  Parents locally have committed to sending their children to the school but they need transport options to make it feasible.  It is a reality today that both parents work full time.  Families need access to pre-school services and after-school services and, therefore, need a more flexible transport system to allow them to support their local rural schools.

While many have questioned the motives of the postponement, I wish to raise a couple of alarming developments that are arising because nothing has been done about them.  While there will be no increase in the tax in the coming year, and first-time buyers remain exempt from the tax, those who bought in 2013 will be liable from this December.  Property tax is a massive issue.  Recently, good honest people came into my office who, because house prices had gone up, were afraid their house insurance would not cover them properly if their homes were undervalued.  Accordingly, they declared their houses to be worth more and Revenue now wants to back-tax them for being honest.  This is unacceptable.  Homeowners did not mean to increase their liability so it is unfair to ask them to pony up the back tax if their houses were never undervalued before this year.  There is a system to appeal against a liability when the price of a house has gone down but not when it has gone up.  More than 13,280 corrections to valuations have been made to Revenue, including 700 made last year.  This was done by honest people who are now all liable for back tax.  Were they unfairly penalised for coming forward?  Maybe some had incorrectly valued their property initially and are now looking to sell it.  What about those who have seen new value added to their homes?  All values are going up.<\/p> <p>My second point concerns people who, because of their means, could defer payment of the tax.  The deferrals will continue but the income thresholds were recommended to increase to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple, up from &euro;15,000 and &euro;25,000, respectively.  By keeping the threshold low, however, this Government is going to penalise fixed-income pensioners whose weekly payment has increased.  Since last week, a pensioner couple will earn &euro;25,800 and cannot now defer their payment.<\/p> <p>Both these issues seem so mean in our current climate and they are very unfair.  People are coming into my clinics with real concerns about them so I call on the Minister to come to the House to discuss these issues with me and Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#T00100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I am totally opposed to the Bill to amend the Act dealing with amusement trades, especially sections 12 and 13 of the new Bill.

On occasion, however, it is useful to stand up to welcome developments which will improve people's lives.  I refer specifically to the new arrangements the Minister for Health has made with doctors to allow many more services, including chronic illness care, to be provided in general practice settings.  The arrangements will cover things like diabetes, asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease, cardiovascular disease and heart failure, which is increasingly common as many of us, fortunately, are living into older years.  Something I have felt very strongly about will now be possible in general practice.  This involves the 8,000 patients in the general medical services, GMS, scheme with haemochromatosis, an iron metabolism disorder which requires them to have a pint of blood taken off at frequent intervals to protect their health.  Until now, this has been done in hospitals but it is well capable of being done in GP surgeries.  Indeed, some GPs have been doing it.  If one was a private patient, one could get it done, but as a GMS or uninsured patient, one could not.  This welcome news for 8,000 people speaks to the many other things that could be done in primary care but which are currently taking place in hospitals at great inconvenience for patients who must travel long distances.  It is also a cause of pressure on hospital services.<\/p> <p>I welcome this deal and use the opportunity to call for further diagnostic services in general practice.

It would allow GPs like me to diagnose and treat our patients in the community, never having to send them to hospital at all.  It would be much more convenient for patients and provide great job satisfaction for doctors.

Currently, both counties are served by Tearmann Domestic Abuse Service.  I acknowledge the great work it does on behalf of unfortunate individuals who find themselves in need of help in such circumstances.  Tusla is in the process of reviewing domestic violence services across the country.  Based on information I have received from Tearmann and others, there is a need for a dedicated refuge for people who find themselves in such a difficult and stressful domestic situation.  There is also clearly a need for increased resources in this particular area.  Last year, for example, the service supported 260 people, mostly women but some men.  It is important to remember that this support also involved over 400 children.  We all know that domestic violence and marriage breakdown are traumatic for those involved, particularly children.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to expedite the review and ensure that additional resources are made available to those who find themselves in such difficult, dangerous and traumatic circumstances?

This is the eighth theft of an ATM in Northern Ireland and there have been many more in Cavan and Monaghan.  What is happening?  Do the banks put tracker devices on these ATMs?  The robberies are a significant inconvenience to staff and customers, as well as putting fear into communities.  I cannot understand how a digger can be brought up a street in a small village on a Saturday night, rip apart a cash machine in a garage and nobody seems to know anything about it.  I am not a detective.  However, in this day and age, do these cash machines not have tracking devices attached to them?  As Bertie Ahern rightly stated, it is not the boy scouts who are doing this.  It is believed that dissident republicans are responsible.  This is a worrying trend.  If it were to happen in every town and village, there would be no cash machines left at all.

It occurs in urban areas but particularly in rural areas.  I keep seeing photographs on Facebook of local election candidates and sitting councillors who have been canvassing somewhere and there are 50 black bags in a field which have sometimes been set on fire.  I do not know whether an industry is involved and people are collecting this waste from houses and dumping it, or whether it involves people disposing of their private waste.   I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come and discuss this topic in this House as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>Illegal dumping seems to be rampant across the country.  I know there is an issue of people dumping in urban areas.  Sometimes people move out of houses and 100 black bags and various other items are discovered in the back garden.  I often see bags that are full of cans, bottles and paper, all of which can be recycled for free.  It may be that the civic centres and recycling facilities to which people can bring such items are a long way away but education is probably needed.  Maybe waste collectors are very expensive and that is an issue.  <\/p> <p>We need to survey households to see where their waste is going.  Many people responsibly dispose of their rubbish through a door-to-door collector or go to civic recycling facilities.  My former local authority, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which covers the area in which I live, is winning awards for having good recycling centres.  I am sure most local authorities have very good recycling centres but there will be a residual amount of waste that is not recyclable.  We need to try to reduce that as much as possible by examining what packaging is permitted to be recycled and what is not because illegal dumping is a scourge right across the landscape.  I saw a Tidy Towns clean-up in Ballybrack in Dublin which, very easily and quickly, produced hundreds of bags and that is a relatively urban area where waste collection is available.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the waste market as soon as possible.  I am not giving out about waste collectors which do their job well, by and large.  There are certainly people who are not using these services and are not disposing of their waste responsibly by other means.  We need to look at what can be done about that.  The practice of people throwing sofas, electronic equipment and black bags into hedges during the night must not be allowed to continue.

The information I have is that the HSE wrote to the company informing it of its proposal to refuse reimbursement of Spinraza at the price offered by the company but allowing for an opportunity for the company to come back to the HSE with a different price option.  As Members will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 allows for 28 days during which a company may come back to the Department or the HSE.  My information is that the HSE has received a revised submission.  The HSE drugs group is now considering that price and will make a recommendation.  I do not have more up to date information than that but drugs companies have an obligation to come back to the HSE with reasonable prices so that we can ensure people are able to avail of medicines.  <\/p> <p>Senators McFadden and Ardagh raised the report from National Cancer Registry Ireland.  According to the report, one in two of us will develop cancer in the coming years.  As Senator McFadden rightly said, outcomes have improved and people are surviving longer and have better access to treatment and medicines but it is important that we invest in cancer care and services, the national cancer strategy is updated and resources put in place to ensure the strategy is fit for purpose.  Last Friday, I visited Cork ARC Cancer Support House to look at its proposal for the new development, which involves a suite of rooms and treatment centres and would provide people with an opportunity to meet.

He is also correct that it is the most vulnerable and those who can least afford it who end up going in to these places.  I fully subscribe to the point made by Senators McDowell and Lawless that gambling is a scourge on many families from which no community is immune.  I support Senator McDowell's view that it does not add anything to society to have places where gaming machines are operated.<\/p> <p>In the context of any legislation, it is important that we do not remove power from local authorities.

Senator McDowell will be glad to hear I agree with him.  None of us in this House is anti-Semitic or anti-Israel.  From the point of view of what is being proposed here, it is a free and democratic election.  Like Senator McDowell, I do not take my lead on Israel or Palestine from President Trump but it is important that we have a sensible debate.  In fairness, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have taken a strong line on Israel and Palestine.  I am not sure the Bill to which the Senator refers is a good one but it was passed in this House.  It is important that the Israeli people have their vote today.  It is equally important that the world community upholds human rights.  Like the Senators, I believe in the rights of Israel but I also believe the Palestinian people have a fundamental right that we must all try to honour as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of trolleys in hospitals, which are a source of concern.  We have seen HSE investment in initiatives to target waiting times in emergency departments.  The Senator also referred to staff recruitment.  It is important to recognise that the Government has in recent years provided capacity to recruit more doctors and nurses to work in the health system.  Since 2015, the number of medical and dental staff has increased by 1,132 or 12%, the number of nurses has increased by 2,291 or 6.4% and the number of health and social care professionals has increased by 1,918 or 13%.  The number of health service staff in management and administration increased by 2,340 or 14% in the same period.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that there is a need for more investment in front-line services and I share Senator Reilly's view that a greater emphasis on primary care is needed.  The Government, as Senator Reilly noted, has agreed a new GP contract which will make general practice a much more attractive career and allow for treatment at the first point of care.  I thank all those involved in the contractual discussions that have taken place.<\/p> <p>HSE recruitment needs to be targeted at specific areas.  This year, we have the highest health budget in the history of the State.  I am sure some Senators watched the \"Reeling in the Years\" programme the other night in which an infamous Minister for Health, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was shown presiding over the highest ever trolley watch figures.

In County Mayo, we have seen many objections to infrastructural projects and many other projects, which has held them up.

The delays, however, have cost taxpayers millions of euro.  In the Ballina electoral area alone, millions of euro have been spent and nothing has been done because of objections.  I am not saying any or all of those objections relate to natural heritage areas.  <br\/><br\/>I have proposed this amendment because we should put many things aside for the benefit of the community.  The Minister should have the power, as stated in section 18A(5)(<i>b<\/i>), to take an area out of an NHA if it is an enhancement of or benefit to the community, or a benefit to an infrastructure project such as a major road scheme.  I am supported by Senators Mulherin, O'Mahony and &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  I have no doubt the Minister is well aware of how community projects and various other projects can be held up because part of a project is in an NHA.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.

I support the amendment for those reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#DD00300","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Burke on certain matters but I cannot support this amendment.  There is already provision in the Bill for designation by the Minister.  Environmental criteria can be considered in addition to national, regional, and local economic, social and cultural needs.  That provision adequately allows for a balanced and appropriate consideration of economic, social and cultural needs.  Where a strong community case can be made, it can already be made on the basis of the needs of an area.<\/p> <p>The wording of the amendment, &ldquo;which can be of major benefit to a community, enhancement of a community, sporting projects or facilities, golf courses, sports fields, greenways, community gain or strategic infrastructural projects,&rdquo; is a list of almost anything anyone might want to do with some land.  The real concern here is that there is still a frame of mind that regards our bogs, not only raised bogs but also blanket bogs, as being somehow empty space.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Our bogs are doing work.  They are already of major benefit to a community and, indeed, the wider community.  In fact, it is those limited areas that do the work given that Ireland does not have national forestry in the same way as other areas and does not have some of the other environmental carbon sequestration reports.  The bog network already holds up our environment and ecosystems.  Our bogs do that work.<\/p><p>I have a number of concerns about this amendment.  I recognise that there are certain elements within this amendment that may well make a case for greenways.  Let us consider the unfortunate loss of our railways such as the railway line from Galway to Clifden, which the Minister of State will be very familiar with, and the strong case that has been made for decades for the line to become a greenway.  One of the things that greenways do is engage with the balance of the ecosystem and environment.  Unfortunately, the greenways have been stuck right alongside golf courses, which have been recognised internationally as something that we simply cannot afford to continue in the same way.  Ireland has many golf courses and some very famous people own golf courses in Ireland.  We have a green environment and so forth, but golf courses have an environmental impact.  Some that have already been established may be maintained but they need to be in balance.<\/p><p>Bogland, particularly blanket bogland, is very saturated with water.  The environmental impact required to turn waterlogged blanket bogland into a golf course is immense.  It not only does damage in terms of carbon but it does damage in terms of water retention, the water table and the flood plain.  There is also a huge issue with the amount of pesticides and water needed for golf courses.  We have well-established golf courses where the work has already been done.  I understand that they may wish to be maintained but we give them too much privilege.  The Minister of State may recall or perhaps it was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, that I raised concerns about retaining the lower and more preferential VAT rate for members of golf clubs.  In fact, we raised the issue for a number of other areas, including community exhibitions and local art centres.  There are questions about how preferential a tax treatment we need to give to golf courses.  We certainly do not want a situation whereby a willingness to turn large tracts of land into a golf course is enough to justify dedesignation.  Unfortunately, that would be the effect of putting this section here because it goes into a section that says \"notwithstanding 18(3)\".  So, notwithstanding the other considerations and all of the work that we have done and discussed in terms of other areas, there are real questions here.<\/p><p>I encourage the Minister of State not to accept the amendment because he can assure all in the House that in considering national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs, he has enough room.  What is important about where they are currently placed in the Bill is that they are required to be set against the environment considerations rather than be a stand-alone provision on their own.  I encourage those who proposed the amendment to consider tabling separate amendments on some of the different activities because there is a big difference between a greenway and a sports field, and a sporting project in a general sense or a strategic infrastructural project.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Minister of State will recall our discussion on blanket bogs.  Perhaps we will have a chance to return to this matter again.  He referenced the fact that it had already been discussed and debated on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Since our debate I checked to see exactly what was debated in the D&aacute;il.  What I found was that the case being made for many years for the dedesignation of blanket bogs was one where we have been trying to build a road through the heart of Connemara and designation has been a problem.  I would ask the following when we say strategic infrastructural projects are enough of a reason to dedesignate a bog.  Would a road through the heart of Connemara be considered a strategic infrastructural project that may benefit from this new loophole?  I note that the Minister of State's colleague, the then Minister in charge of this area, Deputy Heather Humphreys, said that the Minster should not have \"power to dedesignate an NHA without having carried out preparatory scientific analysis\".  We have discussed the fact that that has not been done yet and, indeed, that it would not send out a good signal for how we protect bogs and heritage areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040900002#DD00400","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1554816600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
