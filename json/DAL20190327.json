They are well aware of the position of the national broadband plan.  Since its inception it has driven very significant private sector investment, as it was intended to do.  When we entered Government in 2016, 50% of premises had access to high-speed broadband.  Over the past five years commercial development has led to investment of &euro;2.75 billion in upgrading, expanding and modernising the networks.  We are now in a position where 74% of premises have high-speed broadband.  Despite that substantial progress, more than 1 million people and 100,000 enterprises, mostly in rural areas, are unlikely to receive this vital service from the private sector.  These are mostly located in the more remote, dispersed and harder to reach areas in rural Ireland, which encompass 96% of our landmass.  The challenges involved in providing high-speed broadband network in Ireland are significant due to the dispersed nature of the rural population.<\/p>  <p>  As for the present plan, I note we have received a final bid from the tenderer.  That is undergoing due diligence in my own Department with the involvement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I intend to bring a recommendation, as the Deputy said, to Cabinet before Easter.  What happens after that will obviously depend on the Government's decision, but if a decision is being made one way or the other, we will obviously consult with the Opposition and the House at large.  How that will be done will be decided as part of the decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700003#A01700","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1553682600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>While I accept the Minister's response, the second part of it is somewhat problematic because of the information available to the Oireachtas.  We have had no role in this tender process to date, notwithstanding my best efforts and those of many others to elicit information along the way.  We understand that the bidders' initial requirement was a clear position that the State would invest &euro;500 million.  SIRO and Eir cited their failure to develop a business case on that basis and as such did not proceed with a tender.  We now understand from utterances of the Taoiseach that the cost will run to many multiples of that, possibly as high as &euro;3 billion.  That raises serious questions about how the Government can proceed with a project with an entity that went ahead and bid &euro;3 billion when others were told that moneys like that were not available and pulled out of the race.  There are issues around competency and whether this is the appropriate way to proceed.  There are also issues regarding the role of Eir in providing broadband to another 80,000 premises, and perhaps that of Imagine, which has announced plans to cover 400,000 premises.  The Minister expects the D&aacute;il to make determinations on a lot of questions but we have been provided with no information along the way.<\/p><p>It is somewhat disingenuous of the Taoiseach to suggest he will let the D&aacute;il be the final arbiter on a tender process into which we have had no input whatsoever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700003#A01800","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553683200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has been clear that the Government fully accepts responsibility for making a decision, but he has also signalled that a decision of this nature would bind future Governments.

I intend, depending on what decision is taken, to make full and extensive information available to Deputies for them to evaluate.  As the Deputy knows, we have had debates here during which I have been at pains to point out that the issues being raised by Deputies such as the robustness of the technology, the adequacy of the governance arrangements, the way in which this issue is being scrutinised in view of the fact that there was only one tender left standing have been the subject of immense due diligence and detailed work by the Department.

In 2012 Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a proposal that we use the State and semi-State infrastructure already in place, in particular the ESB and metropolitan area network, MAN, systems.  A strange thing happened over the weekend.  The Taoiseach and leader of the Minister's party said on Sunday that we could not use the ESB pole infrastructure for this purpose.  In fact, he said we could not use poles at all, that it all had to be underground, even in rural areas.  If that is the case, the ducting will have to be run underground as far the Black Valley in County Kerry, but it is not the case.  I do not know who is briefing the Taoiseach.  Is he not aware that Eir is already using poles?  Is he not aware that the ESB is already using poles to hang SIRO broadband fibre cables?  Let us try to put that notion to bed.  It raised significant concerns for me when I heard the Taoiseach talking about it at the weekend.  There are question marks over whether the Government and the Taoiseach fully understand the entire process.  There have been four Ministers involved in this process and it looks farcical from the outside.  We have one bidder and costs that have gone from &euro;500 million to &euro;3 billion.  The Government has no bargaining power.  Does the Minister honestly believe this is still a competitive tender process?

At that point, an additional approach of scrutiny was put in place by the Government to ensure that, even though there were no longer separate bids, the issue of value for money could be properly evaluated.  It has been put in place and outside consultants have looked at a range of costs and tested the various assumptions, projections and submissions made by the tenderer.

An Post has developed a strategic plan which includes measures such as investing &euro;50 million in growing and modernising the post office network; splitting the company into two distinct business units, namely, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail; relaunching its parcel business following a breakthrough labour agreement; and diversifying and growing its financial service products.  It has recently reported strong growth in its parcel business and a much improved financial performance.  It is continuing to make good progress in implementing its strategic plan which will see a range of developments across the mails and retail businesses.  A refreshed and modernised An Post brand has been launched in recent weeks, alongside a new financial services proposition, An Post Money, and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce.  <\/p>  <p>  A &euro;30 million loan was provided by the Government to An Post to support the required transformation programme.

In about two or three months the front door will be on the N80 because of the completion of the orbital route around Portlaoise.

The computer security incident response team, CSIRT, is in the Minister's Department.  Why has he designated his Department and himself as the regulators of this vast area that is so central to our lives?  Is it intended to introduce legislation in the House so that we get an opportunity to discuss all aspects of cybersecurity and to decide whether or not we need a fully independent regulator?  There are so many elements to this, for example, the Internet of things and block chain technology in finance.  Many people are very interested in technology and wonder if we are being incredibly lethargic in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700008#F00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1553685600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>The Deputy likes to dish out complaints but I am not so sure he is aware that a consultation is underway to which he could submit his view if he believes there should be an independent regulator and that it should not be done by having it within the Department, as it has been done in the past.  He can submit that view.  Clearly, this consultation is open to evaluating whether the structures in place are adequate.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an area where there are growing threats.  The measure about which we are talking today is not showing delay.  We are designating all of the areas I pointed out such as transport, energy, banking, financial market infrastructures, health and drinking water.  They will be required to identify means of protecting their infrastructures.  That means they must look at human issues, access control policies, technological responses, electronic measures to protect their infrastructure, firewalls and encryption.  All of those issues must be addressed.  They must also have adequate measures to detect anomalies or events on a system, including how monitoring is to be conducted, the processes in place and whether they are fit for purpose.  This is putting in place the protections we need in the banking system, the electricity system and so on.

It would make Ireland 100% dependent on importing gas and oil instead of using our own natural gas.  We know that Ireland's indigenous production at the Corrib field is declining.  The Kinsale field is approaching the end of its life.  Furthermore, importing our energy over long distances from third countries could have the perverse effect of increasing emissions as energy is consumed in delivering this product to Ireland.

This is a global problem.  The emissions that come from any fossil fuels which are extracted affect the entire planet.

In response to the previous question, the Minister of State mentioned the Citizens' Assembly and the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I am a member of the committee, which will issue its report tomorrow.  The committee has been advised by Professor Peter Thorne, who recently wrote about the cyclone in Africa.  He said \"we can be pretty confident that rainfall associated with such systems has become greater due to human-induced climate change\".  He pointed out that a warmer atmosphere can hold more water and that if the ocean surface is warmer, there is more moisture going up than coming down.  On average, the citizens of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, who suffer from terrible extreme weather events, are responsible for a tiny fraction of emissions compared with their counterparts in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.

That is the key to this issue.  The Minister is working on the preparation of an all-of-Government climate action plan, which will make us a leader in responding.  We are working with our colleagues across the Government to develop new initiatives in electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and a range of other sectors where we have to make changes.  Some of the changes we have to make might not be palatable, but they will have to be made nonetheless.  We have to make sure they are made in a way that supports businesses and farms.  If we do not do that, I do not know what we are doing.  The plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with specific timelines and steps needed to achieve each action.  Clear lines of responsibility will be assigned.  The Government is preparing an action plan with action dates and timelines to be fulfilled.

Bulky household goods, such as mattresses, are a problematic waste stream for local authorities when they are illegally dumped in ditches and green areas.  They are unsightly and their presence generally encourages further illegal dumping in an area.  That is why my Department provided funding under the 2018 anti-dumping initiative to support a mattress amnesty campaign nationally.  Under this initiative, approximately 11,000 mattresses were collected at 40 events throughout the country, with local authorities encouraged to direct these mattresses to the network of social economy enterprises for recycling.  On foot of the impact of last year&rsquo;s initiative, I am considering, as part of the 2019 anti-dumping initiative, to targeting the problem of illegal dumping in a holistic manner.

It not like garden waste that can be put into the green organic bin and moved on to be recycled that way.  Last year was one of the worst years for fly tipping and illegal dumping on streets and in back alleys, ditches, bogs, forests etc.  My understanding is that the cost of the scheme last year was relatively small.  The Minister might tell me what that cost was.  When the then Minister announced the scheme, I remember the figure was fairly modest.  The scheme, however, was a huge success.<\/p>  <p>  In County Laois, more than 800 mattresses were gathered up under this initiative.  There is a high cost if these items are dumped in ditches or bogs.  The local authority has to pull things like mattresses out of drains, ditches etc.  Hiring contractors to deal with that situation costs the local authority greatly.  The National Transport Authority spent &euro;730,000 picking up litter along motorways.  That is another example.  We also need to look at side-by-side competition in the collection of waste in an estate.  It is not feasible for many households to dispose of a couch, an armchair or a mattress.

These projects operate by way of call.  It depends, therefore, on local authorities coming forward with credible proposals to deal with this issue.  A range of measures can be supported where local authorities feel they can organise an effective programme.  We are trying to ensure the money we assign is used most effectively.  If good proposals come forward to recycle mattresses, as was successful last year, we will look at those.  We will also look at other materials such as couches.

The low level of morale within the rank and file, the shabby manner in which they are treated, the gaps in middle management, and the failure to retain and nurture specialist expertise within the forces all point to a failed policy of the Government and a Minister of State who, with the Government, is completely out of touch with the reality on the ground.  In the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service, a consistent message emerges.  Members are exiting the Defence Forces at all ranks at a rate of between 40 and 50 per month.  We learned last October that ships could not set sail because there were not enough crew members to manage them.  The Air Corps operates at 70% capacity.  On the rank and file within the Army, Sarah Walsh of the Wives &amp;amp; Partners of the Defence Forces put it eloquently when she said:<\/p><blockquote>Our families live in poverty.  We suffer from food, income, fuel, and child poverty.  Many of us can only dream of owning our home, and some this month are facing uncertainty about their homes, while others are facing homelessness.  I personally know these people.<\/blockquote><p>The current strength is approximately 8,800, which does not take into account 670 members overseas or 450 in full-time training.  There has been a blind reliance by the Government on recruitment over retention and on recruiting its way out of the crisis.  Recruitment on its own, however, has had no impact on the strength of the Defence Forces in recent years, and the cost benefit of retention over recruitment is indisputable.  There has been a removal of initiatives to enhance retention, such as the fixed-period promotion for specialist service officers, which illustrates the lack of creative thinking to support our Defence Forces.  It restricted members' career progress and left them with nowhere to go, resulting in people buying themselves out of the Defence Forces and leaving in unacceptable numbers.  We have lost much specialist expertise from our Defence Forces.  The Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mellett, has stated:<\/p><blockquote>You are always going to have a churn and a churn is healthy, but I would rather it be down about 5 per cent rather than the 8.1 per cent it is at present.

As Deputies will know, she died from cervical cancer but worked closely with the health service to become a powerful advocate for HPV vaccination and, because of her, we were able to increase its uptake again.  While she has lost her life, sadly, I believe her actions will save the lives of many people.  As Deputies will be aware, she was not connected with the approximately 221 women who were affected by the cervical cancer audit.<\/p>  <p>  I also extend my condolences to the family of the former Deputy, John Browne, who passed away this morning.  People will know him as a colleague in the House and his son who served in the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to the Deputy's question, the Government and everyone in the House are proud of the contribution that our Defence Forces make, whether through peacekeeping, as an aid to the civil power, intelligence or other operations.  We are investing in our Defence Forces and increasing the budget this year, with more than &euro;50 million being invested in barracks, equipment, pensions and pay.  While I acknowledge there is a problem with retention in the Defence Forces, recruitment is going well.  There are record numbers in the classes being attested and graduating, although many people are leaving because there are now many opportunities in the private sector, as the Deputy will know is the case in his constituency in County Cork, where engineers are leaving the Naval Service to work in the private sector.  The Chief of Staff has stated he would prefer to see a turnover rate of approximately 5%, which would be normal, as opposed to the current rate of approximately 8%, and I concur.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that we need to act but we are taking action.  Pay restoration is well under way throughout the public service, including the Defence Forces, and almost everyone earning under &euro;80,000 will have full pay restoration by the end of the year.  There will be continuous recruitment rather than recruitment in bullets or phases, as happened in the past.  We are allowing for the re-entry of people to the Defence Forces, given that, sometimes after people leave, they want to come back and now we will allow them to do so if they so wish.  The fourth and perhaps most significant step is that we have asked the Public Service Pay Commission to examine the issues.  After holding hearings and listening to the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff and the Department, the commission will bring forward proposals which it believes could improve the terms and conditions of the Defence Forces without having an impact across the public sector.  I asked the head of the commission, Kevin Duffy, in recent days whether the report could be expedited, and he informed me he believes that the commission can publish its report by the middle of May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700012#K00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1553688000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I get a sense of the Government and the Taoiseach being detached from the reality of the crisis on the ground.  The Taoiseach said recruitment is going well, but the fact of the matter is that the Government cannot recruit its way out of the crisis.  It must address the retention issues.  Between 1 January and 31 December 2017, for example, the significant recruitment drive by the Department of Defence and the associated burden on operational units and structures yielded a net increase of three personnel to the Defence Forces.  We have been telling the Government about the issue for between two and three years.  It is not something that has just arrived today.  Morale is low at all levels.  A recent Amarach Research survey, commissioned by RACO, found that 79% of post-2013 officers are strongly considering leaving well in advance of their retirement age due to the issue of supplementary pension before qualification for the State contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  At all levels, from pension to pay to allowances, there are no initiatives to retain people.  In fact, it is in the opposite direction.  All the inbuilt structures and so on are designed to incentivise people to leave the Army, the Air Corps and the navy.  Even the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment recruits people from the Army and pays higher rates than the Army can.  The loss of expertise, from bomb disposal to the Naval Service, has been enormous over recent years, but all we have heard in reply is a studied indifference from the Government and a lack of urgency to deal with the crisis.  Does the Taoiseach accept that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700012#K00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1553688600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Recruitment is going well.  The biggest classes ever are coming through and being attested.  For the first time, we have people moving from the non-commissioned ranks to become officers.  There are promotional opportunities that were not available in the past.  There is a particular focus on recruiting more women into the Defence Forces and we are seeing some good results in that regard.  However, there is a high turnover rate of approximately 8% a year, whereas 5% would be more normal.  We are doing four things to address the matter.  They include pay restoration which is happening across the public service, with the next tranche to kick in in the next few weeks.  We are moving from periodic to continuous recruitment.  We are also moving towards a model of re-entry, whereby people who leave can rejoin.  That was not allowed in the past and it is a significant change such that people who have left the Defence Forces to move elsewhere in the public sector or the private sector can come back in, which is very positive.  I do not know why we did not do it before.  Perhaps most significantly, we have commissioned the Public Service Pay Commission to examine the terms, conditions and allowances of members of the Defence Forces.

I am also sorry to hear of the passing of John Browne.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday the United Nations' special rapporteur for adequate housing lists, Leilani Farha, issued a damning condemnation of the Government's record on housing for allowing vulture funds to buy up large numbers of properties across the State, only to let them at scandalous prices.  She said the Government was facilitating the financialisation of housing through providing preferential tax breaks for corporate landlords and standing over weak tenant protections.  We know from last month's homelessness figures that there are now more homeless persons in the State than at any time in our history.  The figure is almost 10,000.  There are tens of thousands of people on council housing waiting lists, while social and affordable homes are being constructed at a snail's pace.  People in the private rental sector are being hit time and again, with rent increases continuing to spiral, and all the while house prices continue to rise.  For many, owning a home is now nothing but a pipedream.<\/p>  <p>  The response from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has been to stick with the plan and let the market do its thing.  It may not have occurred to the Taoiseach yet but his plan is not working.  It is failing spectacularly and the housing system in the State is broken.  This is not just my assessment or that of Sinn F&eacute;in but the verdict of the United Nations that corporate interests are trumping the needs of ordinary people and families in the housing market.  In the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis, we have the likes of Ires Reit and Blackstone making massive profits, paying minimal taxes and fleecing tenants.  It is ridiculous, unacceptable and must stop.<\/p>  <p>  We need a radical rethink and action to benefit those who are struggling and in need of a much-needed break.  Will the Taoiseach accept that there is an urgent need to rein in corporate interests in the private rental market?  It is not that solutions have not been offered because there are solutions.  The Taoiseach and the Minister have refused to act and listen.  True to form, their partners in Fianna F&aacute;il bury their heads in the sand, too.  The Government could do the right and necessary things.  It could introduce with immediate effect a three-year rent freeze and temporary tax relief for renters.  It could support the legislation that will be brought before the D&aacute;il by Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin tomorrow to prevent buy-to-let landlords from seeking vacant possession.  The Government could avail of and implement these alternatives.  We need bold and meaningful action because the UN assessment of the Government's failures needs to be a wake-up call.  Does the Taoiseach accept the assessment of the UN special rapporteur?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700013#L00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1553688600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>As I have not had an opportunity to hear about or read it in full, I would prefer not to comment on it until I have done so.  I cannot argue with the fact that approximately 10,000 people live in emergency accommodation in Ireland.  While there will always be a certain number who will need emergency accommodation for different reasons, 10,000 is far too high which I do not deny for one second.  It concerns all of us in government greatly.  We lift thousands of people out of homelessness every year; we take them out of emergency accommodation and provide them with secure tenancies, but as quickly as we are able to house people, roughly the same number become homeless.  That is why we have not been able to get the number down from 10,000 for the past year.  The solution is more supply.  We need more homes and apartments.  Last year 18,000 new homes were built.  They are new houses and apartments that did not exist this time last year.  There were more new houses built than in any of the past ten years, which is very significant, but we need to do better again.  We need approximately 25,000 new homes this year and 30,000 in the year after.  I do not see it as ideological, as Deputy McDonald does.  I do not see it as social housing versus private housing, people on the housing list versus those who want to buy and the private sector versus the public sector.  I do not see it in that way.  We need more housing, including more social housing, and are getting it, with 9,000 units added to the social housing stock last year and 10,000 or more this year.  We need more private housing that people will be able to buy.  That means working with the private sector and the construction sector to deliver them because most people want to own their own home.  They do not want the Government to own it for them.  It also means having a much better, more regulated rental sector, which is why we introduced things like rent caps and are bringing forward more tenancy rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700013#L00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1553688600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's position could not be more ideological.

The Government is failing.  The United Nations, not Sinn F&eacute;in, states the Government is allowing faceless corporations to wreak havoc on the rights of tenants.

These young men and women organised a climate strike in Lifford, County Donegal, just over a week ago to coincide with the global climate strike carried out by students around the world, initiated by Greta Thunberg.  Sadly, I was the only Deputy to show up at the climate strike in Donegal despite the scale of protest, which saw more than 1.4 million young people march in over 100 countries.<\/p>  <p>  These students will hand a petition, which has almost 300 signatures from students and staff across Donegal, to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, today.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet them to accept the petition.  The petition contains demands from students who say the Government's inaction is killing their future.  They demand that the Government ensure that all fossil fuels are left in the ground and call for a ban on new fossil fuel infrastructure.  They also want a climate emergency to be declared and for the State to communicate the severity of the ecological crisis to the public, including a reform of the educational system to address the need for ecological literacy.  The rapid implementation of the entire Citizens' Assembly suite of recommendations on climate change is also demanded by the students, as well as policy changes to ensure a reduction in emissions from agriculture.  <\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the committee's report will go some way to addressing these demands but its main tenets can only be addressed where there is political will within the Government.  I urge the Minister and the Taoiseach to seriously consider the list of demands in the petition and show they will take seriously the needs of this and future generations before it is too late.  It is clear that this generation of young people will not be quiet on the issue.  They refuse to be the generation that will remain \"the voiceless future of humanity\", as one student activist says.  As Governments like the Taoiseach's continue to fail to respond adequately to climate change threats, climate activism is increasingly being harnessed by the young.  Many of today's climate strikers will not even be 30 by the time the 1.5o deadline comes around in 2030.  That is the significance of this.

They put it up to us, the adults, the politicians, to get more done, not just to talk about climate change or to put forward the measures that are popular but also to get behind measures that may be unpopular or may be difficult and unpalatable for some sectors in society.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and Deputy Heydon attended those protests and spoke with many of the young people involved, as did Deputies around the country and I am glad they did that.  <\/p>  <p>  The all-party climate action committee is meeting at present.  I hope we can get a consensus on the actions that need to be taken when it comes to climate change.  We need a consensus on carbon tax, regulation and the type of investments we need to make.  It will be much more easy to do if we have a political and all-party consensus behind those important measures so that it does not become a matter of point-scoring but a collective effort across politics.  In addition, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working on our all-of-government approach and response to climate change, which will be very much informed by what parameters are set by the all-party committee. <\/p>  <p>  Things happening this year that will make a big difference include, for example, that we are starting to decarbonise our bus fleet, and from the middle of this year all buses operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus will be low-emission vehicles.  The first of those is being tested in Cork at the moment, operating off compressed natural gas.  We have committed to taking coal off the grid, so Moneypoint will no longer burn coal by the middle of this decade.  We will need a transitional fuel such as natural gas to replace it.  I think everyone accepts that is necessary.  We are also investing much more in renewable energy and pushing that forward too.

One of the questions was as follows: \"My organisation clearly demonstrates its interest in staff health and wellbeing.\"  For the HSE as a whole, the percentage who agreed with that statement was 42%, which is not great.  The figure for the National Ambulance Service staff was 11%.  Some 37% of HSE staff were satisfied with their pay levels.  The figure for National Ambulance Service personnel was 6%.  That is the legacy of the Government's austerity pay cuts.  Some 69% of National Ambulance Service personnel had experienced bullying, harassment or both in the previous two years.<\/p>  <p>  These are key workers, they do a stressful job and they work long hours.  Many people call them ambulance drivers but they are a lot more than that.  They are paramedics, advanced paramedics and emergency medical technicians.  They are lifesavers and they deserve to be treated with respect, but they are not being treated with respect by the HSE and the National Ambulance Service.  The HSE refused to negotiate with the union chosen by more than 500 of these workers to represent them.  The National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, is part of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  The PNA has thousands of members in the health service and a full negotiating licence, but so stubborn are the HSE and the National Ambulance Service in their stance, that they refuse even to sit down with the NASRA representatives to negotiate contingency plans for public safety on the days the workers' strike.  The National Ambulance Service phoned its solicitors, those solicitors phoned the union's solicitors, the union's solicitors phoned the union and the union phoned the picket line and then the whole matter was put into reverse.  It would be laughable if it was not for the fact that this ignorant management approach to industrial relations is compromising the health and safety of the public.<\/p>  <p>  The first national ambulance strike in the history of the State is taking place on the Taoiseach's watch.  On 12 March, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, told the D&aacute;il he was confident the dispute could be resolved, but has his Department even sat down with the HSE to discuss resolving it since then?  The Taoiseach might tell the D&aacute;il.  The men and women in the Gallery will be joined by colleagues outside the gates of the D&aacute;il at 2.30 p.m. to demand their democratic right to be represented by the union of their choice.  On 2 April, next Tuesday, they are due to strike again and on 10 April, they will strike again if the matter is not resolved.  The Taoiseach should resolve it before 2 April.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to take the necessary measures?  Is he prepared to instruct the Department to sit down with the HSE before 2 April, instructing it to recognise this union and to resolve this dispute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700015#N01100","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1553689800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The Government is very committed to continuing to improve, expand and develop our National Ambulance Service.  We have increased the budget for the National Ambulance Service every year for four years running.  That money goes towards several objectives.  It goes towards pay restoration, pay increases, extra staff, new ambulances, improving our existing ambulance bases and introducing new technology ranging from Eircodes to onboard equipment.  We have seen a big improvement in our ambulance services over recent years, particularly as staff have been upskilled and as we have more paramedics and advanced paramedics providing emergency healthcare the moment they arrive at the scene, thus providing emergency interventions immediately, long before the patient gets to the hospital and that is the way to go.  There will be many more improvements in that regard into the future.<\/p>  <p>  What the Deputy refers to is of course an industrial relations dispute.  It is principally an inter-union dispute.  There are a number of unions which represent the majority of ambulance staff, paramedics and others which are already recognised.  SIPTU is certainly the main union, F&oacute;rsa is the other union and there may be a third union and this is an inter-union dispute.  We know from so many other workplaces that it is much better to have staff represented by one union or maybe two, rather than having six, seven or eight unions competing with each other as much as trying to negotiate better terms and conditions for their staff.  We have seen that in so many other fields where disputes would have been resolved much quicker to the benefit of everyone had there been only one union or two, rather than six or seven competing with each other and taking members off each other rather than engaging in the work that they should be doing, which is advancing the interests of their members.<\/p>  <p>  This is an industrial relations dispute.

There are plenty of places where four unions are recognised.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the fact that two of the three unions involved, namely F&oacute;rsa and Unite the Union, have less membership combined than NASRA and the PNA.  In fact, their combined membership does not even come close to the combined membership of NASRA and the PNA.  The rank and file members of the biggest union, SIPTU, support the right of this union to be recognised, as shown by the fact that they have stood on the picket lines.<\/p>  <p>  It is an excuse.  The real reason is that the Government does not want the HSE to recognise a union which would not accept and which would challenge and fight the Government's understaffing and underpaying of ambulance personnel and the overstretched and overworked workforce.

Crucially, there is a need to update the terms of reference for the CervicalCheck steering committee to ensure that the Department of Health and the committee stay on board until the Scally recommendations are fully implemented, the backlog in testing has been cleared, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists review is complete and the HPV screening programme has begun to be rolled out.  I am saying this because there was an attempt by the Department of Health to close down the steering committee recently.  I have the minutes here that confirm this.

This is a phenomenon which has traditionally been associated with the construction sector but it has now spread into other sectors, such as healthcare, education, the media and even the retail sector.  The consequences of somebody having been declared self-employed in a bogus fashion are twofold.  First, there is a substantial loss of revenue to the State, which, according to the latest figures, runs into hundreds of millions of euro, which could be spent on social services in this country.  Second, it deprives at the stroke of a pen rights that have been built up and legislated for over many decades, many of them stemming from our membership of the European Union.<\/p><p>The growth of the so-called gig economy and the increased casualisation of work has exacerbated this trend.  It can often be difficult to determine what category a person falls into because the choice is becoming increasingly blurred.  Make no mistake, however, the argument that it is a free choice for an employee as to whether he or she is to be designated as self-employed is not correct.  It is not a free choice in most cases, given the bargaining power between the employee and the employer is totally unequal.  I recognise there are many skilled professionals and craftsmen who work for several customers and they deserve to be classified as self-employed.  However, there are many among the categories of the self-employed, particularly low-paid and unskilled workers, who are obviously not self-employed but have been forced to declare themselves self-employed in order to get the job in the first place.  They are in that position, essentially, because the employer is trying to evade his or her obligations as an employer.<\/p><p>Among the other consequences for the cohort of false self-employed is the inability to bargain collectively, as was recently recognised by the European Court of Justice.  In putting forward this legislation, I am in no way intending to prevent legitimate arrangements unless it is an obvious and blatant tax avoidance measure.  The legislation I put forward today contains a defence which allows for that type of situation and if does not, let me make it clear that I will accept any appropriate amendments if the Government progresses the Bill.  I understand that atypical employment is growing and there are more flexible ways of working now, and all of that has to be recognised.  However, recognising that does not compel us to turn a blind eye to a patently false assertion that some people are not really employees at all, when it is crystal clear that they are.<\/p><p>My Bill has been criticised on the basis it contains penalties under the criminal law.  This was precisely the same approach taken by the Government under the miscellaneous provisions legislation which we debated recently, where the Government provided for, and the Minister argued cogently for, a section which stated that if the employer does not supply his or her proper name and address or place of business within 15 working days, he or she is facing possible imprisonment.  I apply the same logic to my proposal as the Minister used during the course of the debate on that Bill.<\/p><p>There are a number of other Bills before the House.  I understand the AAA has a Bill - it is People Before Profit or the AAA, although I get confused.  In any case, the left has a Bill.  The Labour Party has a Bill which is going through the Seanad at present.  I am prepared to sit down with the representatives of the parties who put forward those Bills to adopt a coherent approach to this matter.  I note the Minister brought a memorandum on bogus self-employment to Cabinet yesterday.  From what I know of the contents of that memorandum, it seems to be another gesture to tokenism.  Radical action is needed and it is needed sooner rather than later.  Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700019#R00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1553692200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700019#R00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553692200,"counter":300,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700019#R00400","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553692200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1553692200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700019#R00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1553692200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700019#R00700","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1553692200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Pensionable Age Task Force Bill 2019: First Stage","time":1553692200,"counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700019#R00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1553692200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the establishment of the Pensionable Age Task Force which shall consider and make recommendations on the appropriate level of pensionable age; to provide for the production of a report on the recommendations of the Pensionable Age Task Force; to provide for the dissolution of that Pensionable Age Task Force and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Pensionable Age Task Force Bill 2019 this afternoon.  This is not the Bill I wanted to introduce to the House.  If Opposition Members were not limited in that no Bill brought forward can involve a cost, I would introduce a Bill that would seek to halt the pension age increases coming down the track.  Instead, I am left with no option other than to take a roundabout way of doing this.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks the establishment of a pensionable age task force with the purpose of considering the appropriate level of pensionable age and to make recommendations to the Minister.  Let us be very clear on three issues when it comes to increasing the State pension age.  First, decisions on what age people qualify for the State pension should not be made based on cost-saving measures.  Second, Ireland is going further and faster than all other EU countries when it comes to setting the pension age.  Third, there are major implications for those contractually obliged to retire at 65 years.<\/p><p>In 2021, the pension age will be 67 years.  In 2028, it will again increase, this time to 68 years.  These increases were decided without engagement with trade unions or groups representing older people or employers, without any debate in these Houses and without any consideration of the significant financial implications that increases to the pension age would have for retiring workers.  Instead, the Government simply went ahead and implemented the changes.  This should never have happened.  These increases in pension age put Ireland on course to have the highest pension age in the OECD by 2028.  In fact, we will have one of the highest State pension ages in the world despite the fact we currently have the second lowest pensioner-to-worker dependency ratio in the EU 27.  This is something the Minister consistently denies yet it is quite clear when one looks at the projected pension age increases across the EU.  In 2028, when Ireland would have a retirement age of 68 years, England will only be moving to 67 years, with plans to increase pension age there to 68 years in 2046, nearly 20 years after Ireland.  Germany will increase pension age to 67 years but not until 2031.  Belgium will increase pension age to 67 years but not until 2030.  France will only be increasing pension age to 67 years in 2023.  The list goes on and on.<\/p><p>On the third issue, we are forcing retirees onto jobseeker payments.  Workers contractually obliged to retire at 65, as well as workers physically unfit to continue in their job beyond 65, are forced to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment rate is &euro;45.30 per week, or &euro;2,355.60 per annum, less than a contributory State pension.  Why should a person retiring at 65, who has worked his or her entire life, never having relied on social welfare, be forced to sign on to receive a jobseeker's payment for a year?  The way in which the Government is bridging this gap leads to the question of how it intends to continue this if and when the pension age increases to 67 years the year after next.  Will those retiring at 65 be forced onto a jobseeker's payment for two years?  That would be a ludicrous situation, seen nowhere else in the world.<\/p><p>This Bill puts forward a sensible and very reasonable proposal to establish a task force, to allow it to engage with the experts and trade unions, listen to them and set the pension age based on that engagement and based on something more than saving money.

The purpose of the summit was to deepen and extend the partnership between the European Union and Arab countries, enabling us to tackle our many shared challenges more effectively.  The summit was the first ever meeting between leaders from the two regions and marked an important milestone in our efforts to deepen the partnership.  Stronger EU-Arab co-operation is required if we are to find effective and sustainable solutions to regional challenges such as migration, terrorism and radicalisation.  It is also essential in countering the many threats to regional peace and security, including conflicts and humanitarian crises in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  At the summit EU and Arab leaders agreed a joint political declaration which restated our commitment to resolving regional problems through a robust, rules based multilateral system.  The declaration also included important commitments on promoting human rights, countering incitement to hatred, xenophobia and intolerance.  It restated our shared position on issues including the Middle East peace process and nuclear non-proliferation.<\/p>  <p>  As well as participating in the summit, I had the opportunity to meet several Arab leaders, with whom I discussed bilateral relations and Ireland&rsquo;s candidacy for the UN Security Council.  I met the Egyptian President, the Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Saad El-Din Rafik Al-Hariri, the Deputy Prime Minister of Oman, the Foreign Minister of Jordan and the Emir of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.  I also had a brief discussion with the Palestinian President, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas.  I also took the opportunity to discuss EU matters, including Brexit, with my colleagues from the EU Council.  I met the British Prime Minster, Mrs. Theresa May, and also spoke informally to Presidents Tusk and Juncker, as I did again at the European Council on 21 and 22 March in Brussels.  I did not have specific meetings with Mr. Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, on either occasion, but I did have the opportunity to speak to him briefly on the margins of the EU-League of Arab States summit and at the European Council last week, as I did with many other heads of State and Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700020#S01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1553692800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>In the dialogue with the League of Arab States was there any discussion on the use of Libya in dealing with the migrant crisis?

At the European Council summit to be held in Romania in May, a strategic agenda will be prepared for the period 2019 to 2024.  What will Ireland's position be in that regard?  The pre-Council statements to be made at the time will be very important in order that the D&aacute;il will be fully informed of the situation.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month a vision for Europe was outlined by the French President, Mr. Macron, in an opinion piece published in the 28 EU member states.

While I accept that a more detailed answer is merited than time will permit, I ask the Taoiseach to give some indication of the Government's views.  <\/p>  <p>  On migration, the Taoiseach has mentioned that the aim of the summit was to improve the partnership between the European Union and the League of Arab States.  Some nation states are struggling to promote democracy and economic development and climate change is a big issue for many of these states.  It is right that the European Union support them.  It is in its interest to do so from the point of view of dealing with migration, the root causes of which we must address.  More than 1.5 million refugees came to the European Union from Syria in 2015 and other humanitarian crises have been unfolding since, as mentioned during the course of this discussion.

I do not think he even responded when I raised the issue.  In advance of the protests I said it was likely that hundreds of Palestinians would be killed and that turned out to be the case.  It is estimated that more than 200 Palestinians were killed and that a further 18,000 were injured.  The conflict continued for months.  Land Day is coming up at the end of this week and further protests are planned by the people of Gaza to vindicate their right under international law to return to the homes and villages from which they were expelled in 1948.  Israel is already giving signs that it is going to do the same as it did last year.  More innocent Palestinian blood will be shed as the Israelis seek to deny the Palestinians their rights under international law.  At the same time, the US President, Mr. Donald Trump, in defiance of international law, has legitimised the illegal annexation by Israel of the Golan Heights which is sovereign Syrian territory.  Was there a discussion at the EU-Arab League summit on the likelihood of the conflict escalating into violence again because of the justified and legitimate protests by the people of Gaza to vindicate their rights?  Was there a discussion on the behaviour of President Trump in legitimising the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and his systematic denial of Palestinian rights?

The Assad regime's brutal suppression of dissent and the added ferocity of attacks since Russia began to take a leading role have resulted in displacement which is causing immense hardship for the people involved and exerting real pressure on neighbouring countries.

Did the Taoiseach make any statement about how people are being treated by authorities in some European countries and by European Union funded agencies in North Africa in particular?<\/p> <p> The move to a security alone approach, which is being pushed by some Governments under the influence of the hard right, is very dangerous.  It remains the case that security and enforcement takes up 70% of all European Union funding relating to migration and immigration.  This means organisations that take the lead in supporting integration are left scrambling for funding and are less able to undertake the type of work that would reduce tensions and help migrants and their host countries.  The future regulation and funding of this sector is currently being discussed at European Union level.

I assume that when the Taoiseach was in Egypt for the EU-Arab League summit, relationships between the EU and Israel must have been discussed at length, and also the relationship of the EU and the Palestinian people.  I would like to know the Taoiseach's reaction, speaking on behalf of the Irish Government, to the statement by President Trump.  It is certainly an extraordinarily historic move by the Americans and is an area into which they have not previously gone.  The statement has come days before an Israeli election.  Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss this with his EU counterparts?  More importantly, what is the Government's view and what is the Taoiseach's view of what President Trump has done?<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the summit at Sharm El-Sheikh, did the Taoiseach have an opportunity to discuss climate change?  Each Deputy who has spoken here so far has referred to various dreadful conflicts in different parts of the Mediterranean.  Many of these conflicts have come about partly due to the severity of climate change affecting much of Africa, including north Africa.  In particular, Mozambique and southern African countries are experiencing the aftermaths of a ferocious storm that has caused massive loss of human life.  I do not know at this stage if Irish Aid has formally rendered assistance.  I am aware that many of the Irish aid agencies have done so and I commend the Irish aid agencies for the help they are giving to southern Africa in the aftermath of this incredible storm.  It has been a bigger storm than any recorded previously in that part of Africa.

A decision was taken to focus on other issues also.<\/p>  <p>  Land aid was not discussed but there was very strong recognition from Arab states of Ireland's work at the UN and elsewhere in our support for Palestinians, of the role we play in south Lebanon and in other places, and of the funding we provide to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA.  There is very strong recognition from Arab countries that Ireland has been supportive, among EU countries, of the Palestinian cause.<\/p>  <p>  Yemen was discussed, climate change was discussed and human rights were certainly raised by me and by others: human rights of women, LGBT citizens, individual liberty, democracy and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The nature of the event was that there was a lot of discussion and views but very little interaction.  It was the first time such a summit has been done.

It was also a good opportunity for some bilateral meetings, as these events often are.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not recognise Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights and it never has.  We disagree with the US Administration's decision to do so.  I understand that there is no joint EU position on the matter, but that may follow.  This would happen at the Foreign Affairs Council or at the European Council.  Because it falls under the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions one would have to have unanimity or near unanimity to do so.  One of the flaws in the Common Foreign and Security Policy is that it is not done by qualified majority voting and where there is no unanimity or consensus the European Union cannot take a decision.<\/p><p>Moving to qualified majority voting, however, may mean that on occasion we could end up on the wrong side of a decision, which is something we will have to consider into the future.  If we want a strong European Union which can take foreign policy decisions, a consequence is that we may on occasion find ourselves being outvoted on some of those decisions.  We cannot keep calling for Europe to act together more on foreign policy issues if we do not enable it to do so.<\/p> <p> Deputy Haughey asked a very pertinent question on the Government's view on the future of Europe and the debate in that regard.

Our working position is that we support further enlargement, the capital markets union for the deepening of the Single Market, the digital Single Market and banking union, and we want to see the delivery of the social Europe agenda based on the Gothenburg declaration.  However, we do not support a European army or, at least, would not participate in one nor do we support tax harmonisation.  However, that is far too simplistic and probably deserves a more detailed policy statement once we get through our current difficulties on European policy.<\/p> <p> I was asked to comment on populism but I am not sure I can do it in a minute and a half.  However, I can say that I do not like it.  Populism has three essential elements.  These are the idea that there is a division between the elites and the people and that only populists can represent the people; the proposal of easy solutions, which do not work, to complex and difficult problems, and the demonisation of opponents.  In Ireland, we see left-wing populism to the fore rather than the right-wing populism one tends to see in other countries.  I see the elements of populism mentioned much more frequently on the far left in Ireland.  They claim it is the elites versus the people and that only they can represent the people.  There is demonisation of opponents and simple solutions that do not work are proposed.  That is very much a feature of far-left politics in Ireland whereas we do not really have far-right politics here.  I hope we never do.<\/p> <p> I was asked about Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n and Fidesz.  Obviously, that is a party matter but Fidesz has now been suspended from the EPP.  That may result in expulsion down the line or in them rejoining.  It will depend on whether the party satisfies the criteria set down and whether the three wise men who have been appointed to analyse whether it has are satisfied.  The EPP is an umbrella group and every group includes parties that need further scrutiny.  We have now acted.  The Party of European Socialists must now consider the situation in Romania where a government led by social democrats has serious corruption issues which are under examination by the European Commission.  The Party of European Socialists must also consider the situation in Britain and the increasingly Eurosceptic-led Labour Party which has serious issues around anti-Semitism to the extent that Jewish Members of Parliament are resigning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700021#T01800","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553694000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>It is extraordinary to link the British Labour Party with Fidesz.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700022#U00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1553694000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>It is always good to clean one's own house as well as someone else's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700022#U00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1553694000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>It is extraordinary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700022#U00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1553694000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is defending his colleague, Mr. Orb&aacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700022#U00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1553694000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

Given that my Department is largely concerned with co-ordination across Departments, it does not generally hold a significant number of public consultations on specific policy issues.  However, while no other public consultations are currently planned in 2019, it is, of course, possible that this may change during the course of the year.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to launch the public consultation planned as part of the annual national risk assessment in quarter 2 to help inform development of the annual national risk assessment report, which is generally published by July.  The national risk assessment is an annual exercise which aims to ensure a broad-based and inclusive debate on the strategic risks facing the country.  One of the lessons of the recent crisis is that Government did not pay enough attention to dissenting opinions.  As such, the national risk assessment provides an opportunity for an open and inclusive conversation on the risks we face.  This will be the sixth year the Government has produced the national risk assessment and the process has highlighted important issues since the first report was published in 2014, including one of the earliest official acknowledgments of the risks arising from a potential Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the 2019 national risk assessment is at an early stage.  In addition to interdepartmental and public consultation, my Department plans to hold an open policy seminar in quarter 2.

The Prime Minister outlined the approach she planned to take at the European Council meeting.  Prime Minister May explained that she was seeking an extension of the Article 50 deadline until 30 June, which she hoped would provide sufficient time for her to secure agreement and to complete the legislative arrangements needed to implement it in the UK.  I reiterated our wish to see the withdrawal agreement ratified so negotiations on a close, comprehensive and ambitious future relationship between the EU and the UK can start.  I also made it clear that we are sympathetic to the case for an extension.<\/p>  <p>  Members will be aware that the European Council, after some discussion, agreed to an extension until 22 May if the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons this week.  Absent that approval, an extension to 12 April was agreed, by which date the UK would be expected to bring forward alternative proposals and give an indication as to whether it intends to take part in the European elections.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to believe that approval of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland, is the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border on our island.

He has aggressively attacked anybody who has challenged him to be open with the Irish public about what is being planned.  Trading on the understandable focus on the national interest by the media and others, the Taoiseach has been desperate to try to paint others as up to no good.  Now he has gone even further and said that it is a conspiracy theory to suggest that anything has been discussed about what would happen at the Border if there was a no-deal scenario.  Anybody who raises what was discussed is engaging in conspiracy theories, yet the Taoiseach has been forced to admit on the record of the House that talks with the Commission have been happening at official level.  He went on to say yesterday that there are no papers or documents and there is nothing to share.

If she does not and through a series of indicative votes there is some proposition relating to a softer Brexit, a customs arrangement, a Norway plus arrangement or the like, how much clarity on that will be necessary, from the Taoiseach's understanding of the European Union's perspective, to enable a long extension to occur?  What we must avoid is a further nine months, year or two years of more uncertainty, more game playing and more unreasonable and unworkable solutions being put on the table by politicians in Britain.  We must get to a point where businesses, farmers and citizens on the island of Ireland and across the European Union have some certainty about what is going to happen.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that his comments in the past regarding a no-deal scenario and what would happen at the Border have been taken out of context by politicians in Westminster.  Perhaps he will take this opportunity to make it clear that if there is a hard crash, it will be a disaster for the Border and for Ireland and that while some solution will have to be put in place through a negotiation between the British Government and the European Union, it would fall far short of the protections the backstop currently provides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032700023#V02600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1553694600,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Obviously we hope that a deal might be done to resolve this matter, but we do not know if it will be done.
