Mr. Conor Falvey is assistant secretary in charge of the culture division of the Department, Ms Tania Banotti is director of the Creative Ireland programme and Dr. Aodh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic is sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir na Gaeilge in the Department.<\/p> <p>  We very much welcome the opportunity to meet the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  Covid-19 is having a devastating impact on the arts and culture sector.  The Department has been engaged in an ongoing and wide-ranging consultation with stakeholders from across the sector since the commencement of the crisis.  This engagement &ndash; with national cultural institutions, the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, advocacy bodies, resource organisations, theatre companies, and individual arts practices and artists &ndash; has been fundamental to addressing the impact of Covid-19 on the sector, and making effective interventions to help the sector.  More recently, this has extended to the commercial for-profit sector, with which we are currently engaged, and from whose representatives the members heard such eloquent testimony on Tuesday.<\/p> <p>  During these difficult times, culture and art have provided a way to show a community's sense of place while allowing people to express their creativity and resilience.  Bringing people together even when we have to stay apart, inspiring and sharing, are the powers of art, the importance of which has been made ever more evident during the Covid-19 crisis.  It has been encouraging to see the surge of people accessing cultural content online during Covid-19 - from virtual artists to museums and galleries, streaming of films and even community arts groups via social media - showing the fundamental role that culture and the arts play as a source of resilience during difficult times and, ultimately, its ability to produce high-quality material, which connects with communities and individuals and is made available online to the public.<\/p> <p>  The Department has supported a number of initiatives to ensure that the public has access to quality cultural and creative online content.  For example, Culture Ireland&rsquo;s innovative Ireland Performs series involved 120 online performances, in partnership with Facebook, and was delivered in April and May to a global audience of 750,000, while the Other Voices Courage programme included a number of performances from our national cultural institutions, which reached audiences of more than 2.7 million, with 1.15 million live views.  Those views were not just domestic but international, which is important from a tourism perspective.  The Creative Ireland programme also delivered a number of initiatives which provided creative opportunities for the public, working with Healthy Ireland, or through local authorities in the delivery of the highly successful Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g.  Critically, all of these initiatives also provided opportunities for paid work for artists and creatives when few other opportunities were available.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the challenges facing arts organisations, there were a number of immediate responses.  The Arts Council quickly assured funded organisations that funding remained available in 2020 and that it could be drawn down sooner.  This was intended to help tackle cash flow challenges posed by the cancellation of events and to minimise the impact on artists who might otherwise not have been paid.  In terms of other supports, individual artists have access to the pandemic unemployment payment and where they struggled to access these supports, the Department provided helpdesk support to individual artists to ensure that they fully understood the supports available.  This practical assistance flowed from engagement with arts organisations and proved to be of real, practical support to people in the sector who were experiencing a crisis in terms of immediate income.<\/p> <p>  While the impact of Covid-19 for some aspects of the cultural sector can be quantified in terms of the number of institutions or sites closed or the loss of revenue for cultural and creative industries, other facets of culture are harder to gauge.  The Department is currently conducting a survey to evaluate the continuing impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the sectors supported by it and to better understand the ongoing experience of organisations and individuals affected by the crisis.  This information will help to inform the ongoing policy response of the Department to support the sectors during the pandemic.<\/p><p>Officials are also analysing the recent reports from the Arts Council expert advisory group and the National Campaign for the Arts, and the recommendations outlined therein.  We are pleased to report that several of these recommendations are already being implemented.<\/p><p> Drawing on all of the feedback received in the early phases, there was evidence that while the actions of the Arts Council had addressed the immediate impact on arts infrastructure, that is, venues and organisations, additional measures were necessary to sustain venues and organisations and to support freelance artists in the development of their work.  The issue of sustainability was critical to the announcement on 16 June of an additional &euro;25 million to support the arts and culture sector this year.  This funding will include bursaries and commissions to artists and arts organisations and resources for museums and culture workers as they prepare for the reopening of society.  A total of &euro;20 million is being allocated to the Arts Council, bringing its allocation this year to &euro;100 million.  A further &euro;5 million will be available for other measures, including securing the future of key cultural and museum spaces and facilities throughout Ireland and the production of high-quality digital art and online performances.<\/p><p> Outside of these sector-specific supports, cross-Government measures are also playing an important role.  These include - and the committee will be very familiar with them - include the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment until 10 August 2020 and the cross-sectoral economic supports which have been put in place, such as the wage subsidy scheme, increased unemployment benefits, the State credit guarantee scheme-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Licken to conclude if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#C00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We will continue to engage with affected stakeholders, monitor the impacts of Covid-19 on the sector and seek to introduce effective and meaningful supports.

I am joined by Ms Jenny De Saulles, our director of sector development, and Caeman Wall, our head of economic research.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, on her appointment.<\/p> <p>  I will talk briefly about the impact of Covid on tourism, the industry supports that have already been put in place by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the challenges that lie ahead.  First, it is worth reminding ourselves of the vital importance of tourism to Ireland.  Tourism accounts for 260,000, or one in nine, jobs here and was previously worth almost &euro;8 billion to the economy.  In some counties along the Wild Atlantic Way, tourism accounts for more than one in five jobs.  Tourism is not just about jobs and money, however, i t sustains infrastructure and businesses that are vital to the well-being of local communities, culture and environment.<\/p> <p>  Covid has been catastrophic for tourism.  It dwarfs any previous crisis.  Economically, tourism was hit first, hit hardest and will take longest to recover.  The sector has had no revenue for four months.  While revenue stopped, the costs did not.  Despite the supports the Government has already put in place, our initial ballpark estimate is that tourism businesses have incurred more than &euro;1 billion in unavoidable costs while closed.<\/p> <p>  Before we look at the future challenges it is important to look at some of the supports we have already put in place to help the industry navigate the huge challenges of the past four months.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s response was immediate, constructive and comprehensive.  In February, we established a Covid advisory group consisting of industry associations, members, agencies and Department officials.  This group has met 15 times.  We refunded &euro;3 million to businesses in fees that had been paid and set up a Covid task force which has created 14 separate suites of new online business supports and training tools.  These have helped businesses to manage their people, their operations and their finances when closing down, to survive while closed and to assist them during the reopening phase.  These supports have been highly valued and have been accessed more than 300,000 times by the industry via our online hub.  We developed eight new sets of safe reopening guidelines for specific tourism sectors.  These have been viewed and downloaded more than 40,000 times.<\/p> <p>  Our response has been informed by extensive research.  We have had more than 5,000 direct industry engagements and spoken to 21,000 domestic holidaymakers.<\/p><p>We developed and submitted two separate grant proposal schemes, one to help cover the costs incurred while closed and another to help businesses meet the costs of adapting their premises to operate safely.  We also developed and submitted a proposal on tourism specific working capital loans to help get much-needed liquidity into the sector and are delighted that those proposals have been endorsed by the tourism recovery task force.<br\/><br\/>Last weekend, we launched a new heavyweight domestic marketing campaign called &quot;Ireland, make a break for it&quot;.  We also briefed industry on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Covid-19 safety charter, designed to instil public confidence in the safety of tourism businesses.  More than 700 businesses have already signed up to the charter, which we will launch to consumers this weekend.  We have established 23 local destination recovery teams around the country and created a new <i>discoverireland.ie<\/i>website.  I acknowledge all involved for their incredible work over recent months.<br\/><br\/>Looking to the future, while we are delighted that tourism is beginning to reopen, the path ahead will be extremely challenging due to a number of factors.  First, businesses are now carrying a high level of unplanned debt accumulated over the past four months which will make survival extremely challenging if not addressed.<br\/><br\/>Second, revenue will be much lower due to a number of factors.  There has been a complete absence of revenue from overseas visitors and this revenue will be slowly rebuilt.  The blanket 14-day self-isolation requirement effectively writes off 70% of the sector's revenue.  We simply must find a way to facilitate the reopening of access for overseas tourism as quickly as public health considerations can allow.  In addition to the lack of overseas revenue, the capacity restrictions imposed by social distancing measures and the challenges to domestic demand created by health and economic concerns will depress revenue levels.<br\/><br\/>Thirdly, business operating costs will be higher in the Covid-19 world with increased cleaning, screens, signage, personal protective equipment, etc.<br\/><br\/>The range of intervention supports and actions urgently required are captured in the interim report of the tourism recovery task force and we believe these need to be implemented in full immediately.  It will be a long hard road to recovery for tourism but we must not shy away from providing the support the industry will require to recover.  To do so would be to abandon balanced regional development and self-sustaining rural communities.  Following the financial crisis, the tourism industry got people back to work faster than any other sector.  Tourism will recover again but to do so, it needs significant Government support now and for the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his statement and for keeping to the five-minute time limit.

I welcome the presentations that we have heard.  We also heard presentations on Tuesday from organisations in the arts sector, some of which are in receipt of State funding while others have never relied on such funding.  They made a number of welcome suggestions.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the Department and the Arts Council in trying to ensure that at least some of the funding that was to be available for the arts during this year was redirected in an imaginative way to try to tackle the effects of the pandemic.  As our guests today mentioned, there have been a number of spectacular innovations, given the restrictions that have applied.  There have been artistic and musical performances online and I congratulate all of those who have managed to reach their audiences and develop new ones.  I enjoyed a lot of what has been put on in recent weeks.  I managed to sit and listen to my brothers' band for longer than I normally tend to focus.  However, that is not the solution for all artists and musicians.  My mother, who is a sculptor, would never take to the Internet in any shape or form.  She does not understand it and never bothers with it.  My father is a book publisher and the same applies to him.<\/p><p>There is a cohort of artists and those with artistic talent who have not been able to avail of the opportunities of the Internet in this case.  It is important to remember them.  A lot of young artists have come to the fore and well done to them.  I hope they will flourish in future.  How do we reach out to those who have suffered as a consequence?  I am not saying my father or mother has suffered in any shape or form.  They are well and have no issue other than that my father cannot sell his books properly because he cannot have book launches.  It is just that this issue is often forgotten about.<\/p><p> I also congratulate the national cultural institutions.  Well done to those that have managed to open with changes in the way people view the collections.  I hope we will see many more of the private cultural institutions opening around the country.  Given that people are still only just straying from their homes, local museums and heritage sites in particular should be visited.  We should take the opportunity to encourage people throughout Ireland to avail of the great resources we have.  In many other countries, visits to national cultural institutions incur a cost.  One thing that stands to us here is that there is no cost incurred in many of them.  People can go and see material they would pay a fortune to see in other countries.  I have asked before at different committees about funding to try to help local museums and cultural institutions put their collections online.  Now that we seem to be coming out of the pandemic slowly, it is especially important that this work does not stop and we ensure more of the collections are online.  We heard about the effects on tourism.  The tourism sector has always recognised the value of the arts and has used the arts and music to attract people to Ireland.  The more we put online, the more that we can attract people.<\/p><p> There are a number of challenges facing the arts sector, the biggest of which is that, given the nature of its audience, it will be the last sector to fully open.  Several of the groups before the committee on Tuesday mentioned the changes needed to the pandemic unemployment payment to ensure that it continues for the sector and also that it is flexible enough to allow people in the sector to do a day's work here and there because their work is often precarious.  Witnesses from the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC, mentioned one change which does not fall under the Department with responsibility for the arts, although it might be possible to lobby the Department of Finance on it.  A change in VAT would make it a lot easier for them to be more cost effective or at least more cost attractive when setting up events in the future.  Extra distancing means margins will be much tighter.  <\/p><p> What is Ms Licken's view on setting up a full task force with all of the stakeholders to keep an eye on the arts sector in the next weeks and months and to ensure that as problems emerge they are addressed and solutions found quickly?  That is the key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#D00300","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and his family have a long association with the cultural and arts sector.  He is right.  While the online experience we had during Covid-19 has been really great, it is not for everybody or every art form.  We very much acknowledge that.  Part of the funding for the Arts Council and the council's response has been to repurpose its bursaries and provide more bursaries for artists, so they can continue to do work during the pandemic.  That is critically important.  We recognise that.  Books played a significant role during the pandemic and bookshops were very innovative in delivering books to people that sustained them through the crisis.<\/p><p> As for the cultural institutions, we were delighted that six of our cultural institutions reopened in whole or in part on Monday, thereby opening up those treasured collections once again.  They also were accessed online and there was a huge surge in people searching the National Archives during the crisis.  On Monday morning, we went to the National Library, located next door, to see it reopen and it was good to see people in its reading room already.<\/p><p> As I said, the Arts Council is offering bursaries to develop work for the future.  Screen Ireland has pivoted its funding to fund scriptwriters in order that they can develop projects for shooting in 2021 and beyond.

The Creative Ireland programme has a team in every local authority.  It has been looking at things like Show in a Van, where three vans of performers will rock up either to one's house or one's nursing home and, effectively, do small bespoke performances.  That is not in any way to claim it as a substitute but just to state we are considering ways in which artists and creative people can continue to be employed and, for those for whom online does not work, what we can do to bring it in person.  As members are aware, the libraries have provided a fantastic click-and-collect service and, in the case of people cocooning, have delivered a selection of books they believe individuals will enjoy.

Mr. Falvey will address our programmes for the funding of local arts groups.<\/p> <p>  On the Arts Council and the &euro;20 million allocation, it is independent in its funding and funding decisions.  We will take up the issues relating to bureaucracy, form-filling, etc., with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On Cruinni&uacute; na  n&Oacute;g, Ireland is the only country to have a national day of free creative activities for children and young people.  Although it may seem strange, the pandemic was, ironically, the making of it.  Given the extraordinary success of the RT&Eacute; Home School Hub, with 400,000 children tuning in, RT&Eacute;, ourselves and the local authorities partnered up.  It has been a very interesting process.  Obviously, young people have been very affected during the pandemic and have faced particular challenges.  We thought long and hard about various things we could offer to children, young people and their families.<\/p> <p>  I will provide two simple examples of how it took off like a rocket.  One initiative invited people to organise c&eacute;ilithe in their kitchens.  There were lots of videos on storytelling, tunes and learning to play the tin whistle or Irish dance.  The video on how to organise a c&eacute;il&iacute; in one's kitchen received 1.6 million views.  Through Fighting Words, the wonderful organisation set up by Roddy Doyle, we invited children to participate in creative writing.  We were taken aback by the response.  There will be four publications resulting from this initiative alone.  We could not believe the number of entries.  We were really moved by the creativity of young people.<\/p> <p>  I know the Deputy is from County Cork.  He may be aware of the tiny rural school in Cappabue which made a film about climate change that went global.  The school was our ambassador this year.  There is a lot of discussion on online content.  The view of the Creative Ireland programme is that less is more, but the young people in that school made an extraordinary film about the creative things they were doing in County Cork and it has been incredibly popular.<\/p> <p>  I wish to send a big shout out to the local authorities that responded very imaginatively to the problems we faced.  There are challenges in the context of local authorities.  The groups that appeared before the committee in its most recent session expressed concern regarding the financial crisis facing them and that the local authorities may cut back on funding for arts and culture.  That is certainly a worry.  The Creative Ireland programme has guaranteed its funding to local authorities.  The culture teams in the local authorities have been at the heart of the community call during the pandemic and they have responded very imaginatively to it.  The example set by Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g gave young people an opportunity during lockdown to try things they may not have tried previously.  They certainly had more time on their hands.  It has been a real lesson for us.  Some local authorities, particularly those in more rural parts of the country such as County Donegal, had far more participation this year than last.  Hosting 500 events while under a 5 km lockdown was astonishing.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of an initiative for older people, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, will be making an announcement in that regard in the coming weeks.  The Creative Ireland programme is working intensively with the HSE and Healthy Ireland to roll out a specific programme of creative activities for those who are cocooning.  That will cover nursing homes, hospitals, community care settings and home care settings.<\/p><p>We are looking at imaginatively bringing that work to people who may be cocooning, with the added benefit of paid work for artists and creative people to year end.<\/p><p> Reference was made to bureaucracy.  That is obviously a matter for the Arts Council but the council has spoken about trying to simplify its application procedures.<\/p><p> The &euro;20 million must be spent by the end of the year under the public spending code.  The sheer practicalities of getting that money to people will necessitate probably a simplification of the procedures, but the council has already indicated it plans to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tania Banotti","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for their attendance today.

I expect they are not, but Ms Licken might give us details on that.<\/p> <p>  How do we ensure the Arts Council will be able to get our money to artists who really need it?

For example, under the Ireland performs initiative a total of 150 artists got paid &euro;1,000 each to go on Facebook live and perform.  That is an example of innovatively pivoting the funding to a way that directly and immediately supports artists.  The process of repurposing funding will continue where we can or where we need to continue it.  I can say the funding remains in the culture area.<\/p> <p>  The second question related to the Arts Council.  In fairness, the Arts Council responded swiftly to the crisis.  One initiative was to set up an expert advisory group to advise on the best approach.  Part of the consideration is how to ensure exactly that the funding the council gives out goes to artists who need it most.  We expect the programmes arising out of that will reflect that.

The arts and culture sector will probably be one of the last to reopen and it has faced a number of challenges, like many other sectors.  Some of the supports the sector is receiving were outlined by Ms Licken in her opening remarks.  I would like to focus on the arts and crafts and cultural sectors and what supports there will be for them.  I welcome the confirmation from Ms Licken of the &euro;20 million allocated to the Arts Council, as requested by the National Campaign for the Arts, NCAF, and that recommendations have been achieved.  Could she expand on what is being done in that sphere?<\/p> <p>  Ms Banotti mentioned the work and creativity of the local authorities.  The work done by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I was a member, on libraries and creativity in the arts was innovative.  We need to see more of it and the support will be welcome.  Ms Banotti stated there was funding for care homes.  Will the social day care centre be included in that, if and when it is up and running?  There are different settings for older people who need entertainment or require a change in their day-to-day living, and the arts are a very important aspect of that.  Ms Banotti might expand on that.<\/p> <p>  I turn to Ms Licken in respect of the production and performance arts sectors.  As far as I am aware, there is no clear pathway for those sectors and they are worried as of today.  While the funding through the Arts Council is welcome, more clarity needs to be given to those in that sector.  The crafts sector, which I mentioned earlier, also seems to have been forgotten about.<\/p> <p>  Much work has gone into Creative Ireland and the funding has been welcome.  It is great that it has been repurposed so quickly but, again, there may be some questions as to how that funding will be rolled out.<\/p> <p>  On the actions recommended by the NCAF, Mr. Falvey stated the officials were analysing the reports from the Arts Council expert advisory group on the NCAF and that some recommendations have been achieved.  Will he elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelly mentioned the tourism recovery task force in his opening remarks.  He might comment on the implementation of the plan.  Much of the discussion, even this morning on national radio, has been about holidaying at home, rightly so, and the supports for the domestic tourism sector.  I welcome the advertising campaign and the quick response to the need to encourage staycations.  Will Mr. Kelly expand on the capacity in the system?  Summer has been truncated a little into just July and August in Ireland, and there will be challenges with accommodating everybody who wishes to stay at home this summer.<\/p><p>On the question on the NCFA, the expert advisory group from the Arts Council and the recommendations, a key recommendation was the funding of &euro;20 million.  We were in a position to provide that immediately.  That has been a really important immediate response.<\/p><p> Let me take the Deputy through some of what the Arts Council has been doing for the arts and arts organisations.  The funding, including the new funding, will be aimed at the organisations and venues that support artists to give them a sustainable future and it will also be aimed at bursaries, commissioning and digital online content.  That is just a snapshot.  Mr. Falvey can elaborate further on it.<\/p><p> Regarding production and performance, we are critically aware that the ideas of performance and performance spaces are particularly challenging owing to social distancing.  Therefore, it is not just a matter of whether one can reopen but whether one can reopen safely.  Over the past two or three months, we have had a lot of engagement with all in the sector on all the challenges it faces.  Setting up a task force to deal with the whole culture sector, as outlined in the programme for Government, will be a key part of helping to address the issues that arise.  Mr. Falvey might want to elaborate on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#J00600","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Traditionally, our primary relationship with the subsidised arts sector was through the Arts Council and Screen Ireland.  Given that there is now a pandemic, we have opened our doors to all callers.  More recently, we have been engaged with commercial venue operators and promoters.  They have issues associated with the roadmap, how this is to be addressed, and the supports they consider necessary.  We received correspondence from them very recently and it is under examination.<\/p> <p>  We meet representatives of the NCFA regularly.  It has fed in to the expert advisory process through the Arts Council.  There is a strong overlap in the recommendations that have emerged in the work of both the expert advisory group and the NCFA.  Some of these issues are political, such as the appointment of a dedicated Minister for culture.  Some of the requests are for capital support for venues.  This is being examined as a matter of urgency.  I anticipate that we will have a proposal for a Minister extremely shortly in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Other issues relate to the European Union.  It has published a draft multi-annual financial framework, which is to commence in 2021.  It is subject to agreement at European Council level.  There are sums of money set aside within it for SMEs.  The previous Minister had sought, in the context of previous Council meetings, the ring-fencing of some of the funding for arts and culture.  We will continue to examine any opportunities that might present in regard to securing funding for Irish artists and cultural entities through those channels.<\/p> <p>  We will continue to engage with the NCFA and the Arts Council on all these issues in the weeks and months ahead, both on a bilateral basis and through the task force structure, to make progress on all these issues as promptly as we can.

I am not pl&aacute;m&aacute;sing the Deputy when I say the cultural policy of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is a beacon for the country.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the craft sector, we have been working with the Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council of Ireland.  The council is not often mentioned, possibly because it falls under the Department responsible for business.  We have been working on a campaign called Get Ireland Making, whereby the Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council of Ireland worked with a lot of craft makers.  We offered support in learning how to produce online content.  They made a series of videos and webinars and facilitated discussions through which ordinary members of the public, if we can use that dreaded term, could learn about craft skills and try out crafts for themselves, all the while using resources available at home.<\/p> <p>  The initiative for older people has not been announced yet.  I was speaking to Ms Gallagher and I indicated that D&uacute;n Laoghaire is eligible.  Unfortunately, the funding is not infinite and the requirement from the HSE and Healthy Ireland is that we must work with the age-friendly initiatives in the counties in question.  The idea is one of trying to knit the creativity aspect with the age-friendly aspect.  This may be a watershed moment for the whole area covering the arts, creativity, health and well-being.  We are really hopeful that, in the new mental health strategy being prepared by the HSE, the importance of culture and creativity will be front and centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tania Banotti"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Mr. Falvey mentioned the idea of having a specific Minister for the arts as opposed to a Minister for whatever you are having yourself, as was described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#L00100","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>It is not for the civil servants to comment on the make-up of Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Okay.

One of the biggest challenges we face is to create confidence in our economy and give confidence to people that they can go out and spend on recreation, the arts and entertainment.  That is not going to be easy, but it is a challenge all of us in the Chamber face.  In terms of the arts, the season has been almost written off for many during what is generally the busiest time of the year.  Have we explored every option for further online access to exhibitions and events?  Have we considered the different audiences that might not normally be considered?  Have we looked at extending the season beyond what it normally would be into the winter months and having a major winter programme?<\/p> <p>  The arts sector is imaginative, innovative and resilient and there are opportunities to stretch out this season and plan for the 2021 season.

The arts sector often has to deal with the unknown nature of funding, and looking for funding on a month-to-month basis creates a problem.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland presentation.  There are a lot of conflicting views on whether it is safe to travel abroad and whether we should be opening up for visitors to be able to come to Ireland.  One has only to listen to what was said on radio yesterday to hear that.  Are we doing enough on the safety message?  Are we doing enough to encourage people to stay at home and help our tourism sector?  I do not feel that the advertising campaign has been big, broad and quick enough.  It has been reactive.  We knew what the roadmap was and we should have been a little more proactive in planning for that.  The call for people to stay at home needs to be stronger.  It should be almost a call of national solidarity and action for people to stay at home and support the tourism and arts sectors in as safe a manner as possible.<\/p><p>Nobody is going to lose out by not going abroad this year.

As our new Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, said earlier this week, if we look at sport and culture, in particular, and what they tell us about who we are and how we identify as a nation, there are huge synergies in the challenges facing those sectors in the light of the impact of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  That feeds directly into tourism.  As Mr. Kelly stated, 70% of tourism is from overseas.  We saw digital programmes in the Other Voices Courage programme and the Ireland Performs series, which had enormous reach internationally.  Tourism Ireland came back to us promptly to state that was having a huge impact, and we pushed it out through the embassy network.  There are, therefore, huge synergies and also major synergies with broadcasting because, again, we collaborated very closely with RT&Eacute;.  Public sector broadcasting throughout the pandemic really showed its importance.  That was very much the case for us in the cultural sector in pushing out content, which was widely welcomed.<\/p> <p>  Ms Banotti may wish to speak about the season in the cultural sector, but regarding funding I assure the committee that we have a long list of things we have done digitally.

Regarding the Deputy's question about extending the season and online activity, it is a bit like the question of whether a tree falling in the forest makes a sound if nobody is there to hear it.  Obviously, there will be a large amount of online content, but how will the public find that content and how can it be signposted if it is across a myriad of places?  Having made the content, do people then know where it is?  The Arts Council has been examining the idea of bringing all that content together under one website, which it would host.  Those interested in seeing what artists were doing as a result of the pandemic would then have one place to go.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Matthews asked about the cost of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland campaign.  Although Deputies are a sometimes little cynical, there is a need for eyeballs and to direct and tell people what is available.  We must consider not only the making of the work, but also the platforming, showcasing and celebrating of that work.  I know the Deputy is familiar with the Mermaid Arts Centre in Bray.  All the venues are looking at different ways of opening.  Members will not be surprised to hear that I believe the arts community is incredibly resourceful.  There is a sense among members of the arts community that they should just get started and see what is possible.  This could be on the road or by opening venues that are closed to artists to start preparing and workshopping work that the public may not see until next year.  When we talk about extending the season, there is the online season, the work being made now that will be made available digitally and, where spaces cannot be opened to the public for financial reasons, the option of using those spaces creatively as a resource for artists in different ways.  There is a real commitment to consult artists about how to do that better.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tania Banotti"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Ms. Banotti.

The Deputy's point regarding confidence is really important.  There is significant nervousness and concern about people going out to restaurants, going on holidays in Ireland and so on.  To that end, we have developed the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Covid-19 Safety Charter.  Under normal circumstances, this project would have taken a year or so to develop.  We turned this around in about six weeks.  We launched it to industry last week.  By signing up for the charter, industry members are effectively declaring they will implement all the operating guidelines F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed based on public health advice and in liaison with the various Government Departments.  They are also declaring that all of their staff have received the appropriate training in infection control and under the return to work protocol, and they are committing to make themselves available for inspection and assessment.<\/p><p> We launched the safety charter to industry last Thursday and we already have more than 700 businesses signed up to it.  As of yesterday, something like 15,000 employees have been through the free online training F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided for those businesses.  The campaign will be launched to the public this coming weekend.  On top of the money we are investing in the \"Ireland, make a break for it\" campaign, we are investing approximately &euro;1 million in a public information campaign explaining what the safety charter is.  That campaign will be breaking this coming weekend and it is specifically designed to give people reassurance and confidence.<\/p><p> The \"Ireland, make a break for it\" campaign is a significant, heavyweight campaign.  We launched it last weekend with television and radio advertisements and double spreads.  We were getting a phenomenal reaction and trending in the top five on social media all weekend.  It is getting an excellent public reaction.  We do not know the business impact yet because it probably will be another week or so before we see the bookings data coming through, but the public reaction has been phenomenal.  It is a really heavyweight campaign, and another factor is that the timing of it was very carefully done.  Under the Government roadmap, tourism was not going to open until 20 July but that was brought forward, fortunately, to 29 June.  Despite its being brought forward, we were ready to go.  It would have been inappropriate for us to launch this campaign any earlier because we would have been conflicting with Government public health advice.  We cannot have one arm of the Government saying people must stay within 20 km of their homes and another arm saying they should take holidays around the country.  We had to wait until the appropriate time, in line with public advice health, to launch our campaign.  As soon as the timing was okay, we were ready to go with it.<\/p><p> It is important to say that any good campaign has to be based on consumer insight as to what will motivate people to travel.  That consumer feeling and sentiment, as we are all aware, has changed massively week by week.  Doing something that was based on consumer insight five or six weeks ago would have been wrong.  We had to understand where people's heads were at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Kelly to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#N00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>As I said in my opening statement, over the course of the Covid period, we did research involving 21,000 potential domestic holidaymakers to make sure our insight was bang up to date with where people's heads were at.

That is a really important distinction.  We are saying that as fast as public considerations can allow, we need to find a way to a safe reopening.  I know there are meetings ongoing on this issue at various levels.  It comes back to the point that 70% of tourism revenue comes from overseas visitors and 180,000 of the jobs throughout the country that are provided by tourism are provided by the money overseas visitors bring in.  If there is an opportunity for safe access to be opened up, we should look at it.  If there are source markets where there are people who want to come to Ireland and where it is safe to have them come here, we need to find a way of facilitating that as quickly as we can.  We also must bear in mind that this is not something one can just say today that we will do and it will happen tomorrow.

The Government's clearly stated policy with the wage subsidy scheme was that it wanted to maintain the relationship between workers and employers.  In the film industry - which is essentially publicly-funded by means of section 481 - all of the film producers terminated the employment of every single member of their crews rather than put them on the wage subsidy scheme on 12 March.  That showed direct and flagrant disregard for stated Government policy.  Is Ms Licken aware of this and what does she think of it?  To me, it is completely unacceptable.  This seems to be another example of film producers not wanting to take responsibility for employees.  Most of the time they deny that they have any employees at all.

While I congratulate Deputy Catherine Martin on her appointment to this Ministry, it was a glaring mistake by this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government that it did not take the advice from me and my Independent colleagues to appoint a stand-alone Minister with responsibility for tourism.<\/p> <p>  For a number of years, I have been asking for a lowering of the VAT rate.  Since Covid-19 hit, one of my first requests to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, two months ago was for a 0% VAT rate.  I am delighted that since this request, many of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have called for this 0% VAT rate too.  I am hopeful that now they are in government, they will deliver on this measure.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Kelly elaborate on the three aid scheme packages that were submitted to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport a number of weeks ago?  Mr. Kelly referenced the schemes in his opening statement.  He said that F&aacute;ilte Ireland's response has been informed by extensive research, that it has had over 5,000 direct industry engagements and has spoken to 21,000 domestic holidaymakers.  He went on to state that it has developed two separate grant proposal schemes, one to help cover costs incurred while closed, and another to help businesses meet the costs of adapting their premises to operate safely.  He then stated that it also developed and submitted a proposal on tourism-specific working capital loans to help get much-needed liquidity into the sector.  Will Mr. Kelly elaborate, if he does not mind?<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of other questions on tourism which perhaps will all fit into each other.  Bed and breakfast accommodation and other small businesses, including tour guides and tradespeople who do not pay rates, cannot apply for the new funding scheme to help with reopening costs.  Bed and Breakfast Ireland is an organisation that represents 760,000 members across the country.  It states that two thirds of its members have not been able to avail of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment because they are aged 66 or over.  It believes a grant of up to &euro;3,000 should be made available to the bed and breakfast accommodation sector to cover expenses incurred with reopening safely.  Is this a possibility?  Is there any chance of this happening?  Mr.Kelly may be able to answer.<\/p> <p>  There are many questions to which those in the bed and breakfast accommodation sector cannot get answers.  I have spoken to many of them in recent weeks and would appreciate it were Mr. Kelly to answer these two important questions.  Can bed and breakfast accommodation operators be sued if someone contracts Covid-19 when staying in a guest house?  Once a guest leaves a guest house, how soon can that room be reopened to a new guest?  These questions are of the utmost importance to the bed and breakfast accommodation sector and may well be the difference between them reopening in west Cork and the rest of Ireland or not.<\/p> <p>  There is still much confusion among hotels and venues as to how many people can attend a wedding or function.  Is the size of the hotel taken into consideration?  Does Mr. Kelly think this could be made clearer to the hotel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#Q00800","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael Collins.  We will try to move through those questions as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  On his comments with regard to the VAT rate, the tourism recovery task force has recommended that a 5% VAT rate be introduced between now and December 2021 to help the tourism industry to recover and operate competitively.  Currently, the VAT rate of 13.5% places us well above the European Union average VAT rate on tourism businesses, which is between 10% and 11%.<\/p><p> It is our understanding from the advice we have received that the 0% VAT rate is not legally possible.  It cannot come within the remit of the Irish Government to get a zero VAT rate due to European Union VAT regulations.  Our advice is that 5% is the lowest the Irish Government can go under current European Union legislation, and that is what we recommend.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about the three specific schemes.  The first is to help businesses cover costs incurred while closed.  As I indicated in my opening comments, our estimate is that businesses have lost over &euro;1 billion due to costs incurred while closed.  This varies to a large degree depending on the type of business involved.  Costs like insurance, information technology, maintenance and security continued to be incurred so although the Government had fantastic supports in the form of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment in tandem with the VAT holiday and loan repayment breaks from financial institutions, which have also helped businesses, there have been many other costs.  The first scheme is to help those businesses.  We have done an analysis of the costs by different scales of businesses in different sectors and we have developed a grant scheme proposal that has been endorsed by the tourism recovery task force.  Like ourselves and everyone in tourism, we are hoping these will be approved in the July stimulus package.<\/p><p> The second grant scheme is to help costs around the adaptation of businesses arising from having to operate in a world with Covid-19.  These relate to increased costs associated with cleaning equipment, signage and personal protective equipment.  We have seen a range of costs from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 to adapt businesses.  We will not be able to support all those costs but it would be exceptionally welcome to make some contribution to those.<\/p><p> The third scheme we have included is a proposal for a working capital scheme.  Unfortunately, despite all the hard work and great schemes out there, the drawing down on those Government-backed schemes is still very low.  From the tourism industry, one would measure the drawing down on the State-backed schemes in the tens of millions of euro.  In the context of &euro;1 billion of costs incurred while businesses are closed, this is a mere drop in the ocean.<\/p><p> We have analysed each of those schemes, working with colleagues in our Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, as well as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland etc.  We have examined the schemes and understand the gaps and issues.  It will take time for tourism and business to recover and the working capital schemes required by tourism businesses must have low interest rates and long repayment terms.  They need to be as close to 100% of a State-backed guarantee as possible.  It is the proposal we have made.  Once again, we hope the funding can be covered as part of the July stimulus package.  It will be required to help those businesses get up and running so that people can be brought to areas in Ireland again.<\/p><p> Perhaps I will hand over to my colleague to speak-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I am afraid we are out of time but there may be time at the end to address the other matters.

I have some questions for Ms Banotti and Mr. Kelly.  It is wonderful to see Creative Ireland represented at the committee.<\/p><p>A number of people involved in the arts, entertainment, culture and heritage in my constituency, which is Longford and Westmeath, have raised concerns about the threat to the arts and entertainment sector.  If there is a loss of skills in that sector, will there be a knock-on effect on the likes of the Creative Schools and Creative Ireland programmes?  I was heartened to hear Ms Banotti raise the place of libraries in this recovery and as we came through the pandemic.  She is right to give them due credit for the work they have done but also from the local authority point of view outside of the much-needed, and what needs to be guaranteed, income into the arts, entertainment and culture sector.<\/p><p> Local authorities play another role, that is, providing space for exhibitions.  In my area we have a regular turnover of some very talented people utilising that space to showcase their wares.  Also, because of its close link geographically with the library, being in the same building, the first exposure to creativity for very young members of our community is often in the library, not necessarily through books but through the events that are held in the library.  That sector needs to be given kudos for the work it has done.<\/p><p> On a side note, in my home town we had a wonderful initiative called Mullingar Rocks, which was a play on the musical achievements of Mullingar but involved people painting actual physical rocks.  When restrictions were at their most severe, those rocks were left around a 2 km radius and it cheered us up.  That shows the resilience, willingness and ability to change and to bring out that creative nature in people when we are facing the darkest of times.  Specifically, has Ms Banotti had any feedback on the use of atriums for developing artists?  Has there been any talk around the area of that being restricted, delayed or is it likely to come back as soon as we come out of any of the restrictions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#R00500","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question related to the Creative Schools programme.  I have good news on that score.  Not only is the programme continuing but because the schools were closed, additional days will be made available to the schools in the programme for those creative associates to work, and obviously it is paid work, with those schools to the end of December.  There has been much talk about initiative overload in schools.  I am happy to report that is not the case with Creative Schools.  We extended the deadline to the end of June because of the pandemic and we have well in excess of the number of schools for the 150 places available.  There is reference to a big expansion in the programme for Government so we are hopeful.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the librarians, we have a number of librarians who are the Creative Ireland co-ordinators for their local authority and they are a redoubtable group of men and women.  We find, as does the Deputy, that it is about much more than the libraries themselves.  They are involved in everything from the Ageing Well programme to Healthy Ireland.  They are a civic amenity and they are thinking very creatively about what they are going to do.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the atrium, I am aware that the likes of Theatre Forum has been in discussion with arts centres in terms of what else they can do if they are closed or what artists feel they can do if those arts centres are not technically open to the public.  I am not sure that there has been a resolution of that.  I would estimate, and it is within the Arts Council's prerogative, that a significant amount of that &euro;20 million will be going to building-based organisations for them to then be able to open the doors later.

I have some questions for Mr. Kelly relating to tourism, and I will be somewhat parochial.  My constituency of Longford and Westmeath is somewhere between Ireland's Ancient East programme and the Hidden Heartlands.  Specifically, in 2017, and I am referring to F&aacute;ilte Ireland's own figures, the midlands, which would include Laois and Offaly, there were 218,000 tourists representing &euro;85 million, and 93,000 holidaymakers representing &euro;27 million.  I cannot put this in any stronger terms.  We cannot afford to lose one cent of that money in the midlands.  We need every cent of it and more, particularly when we add Brexit into this conundrum as we face coming out of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Hidden Heartlands programme, that is still very much in its infancy.  It is only two years old.<\/p><p>The midlands region, including the Ireland's Hidden Heartlands region, cannot go back to being pitted against the likes of Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Tourism operators in my area tell me that people are initially reluctant and hesitant.  They do not know much about the centre of the country because all they see is the advertising campaigns for the larger cities, but when they do come they fall in love with the place and come back time and again.  The Ireland's Hidden Heartlands programme is based on a trend of soft activities.  The centre of the country is overflowing with them, including water sports, forest trails, castles, heritage parks and the River Shannon.  It is very strongly linked to the arts and entertainment sectors because of the number of theatres and festivals we have.  The Fleadh Cheoil was to be in Mullingar this year.  The Life Festival is also held in the area.  We also have the Marquee in Drumlish Festival and the Granard Harp Festival.  There is a variety to choose from.  Each of these is now cancelled.  <\/p><p> Moreover, due to our geographical location, we do not have an effective rail system.  Not everybody drives.  What engagement has F&aacute;ilte Ireland had with coach and tour operators?  What engagement has it had with the fishing and angling groups who come over at least twice a year?  What specific additional advertising and marketing supports will be made available to the likes of this region?<\/p><p> Mr. Kelly referred to the online business supports, which are a very good initiative.  What is the interest rate on the working capital loan scheme and why, in Mr. Kelly's opinion, has there been so little uptake?<\/p><p> On the \"Ireland, make a break for it\" campaign, I really dislike the word \"staycation\".  I much prefer \"laethanta here-a\", based on a phrase we are all familiar with from school if that is our level of Irish.  How does the \"Ireland, make a break for it\" campaign compare to other initiatives like that of the Italian Government promoting Venice?

It is in the process of reopening and bringing back an awful lot of those staff members, which is a fantastic addition to the national tourism economy, particularly in that region.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland regularly engages with all the groups the Deputy mentioned.  We have a continuing commitment.  Ireland's Hidden Heartlands is in its infancy, but it has met with a fantastic reaction and engagement.  Before the pandemic we saw more businesses from that region than ever before attending international trade shows to build the reputation of the region internationally as well as domestically.  The cancellation of festivals is a national story.  Every county and every artist in the country is struggling with that.  Unfortunately, that is where we are.

Someone in my constituency has five buses that are sitting idle.  That person has a considerable amount of capital investment tied up in that respect and is getting hassle from the banks.  That person wants to continue in business.  I would welcome any continued support from the Government, the Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  People such as the one I mentioned need interest-free loans and significant support because if they do not get it, their businesses will be gone forever.  In many cases, the more successful a business has been, the more damaging the effects of the pandemic have been because of high levels of capital investment.  It is sad.<\/p> <p>  I welcome what Mr. Kelly is doing and appreciate his knowledge and frankness.  I was a little late to the meeting but I was interested in some things said by our other guests, particularly the proposal to extend arts activities to people in congregated settings.  Unfortunately, a relative of mine is in a nursing home and most of the residents of nursing homes are staring into empty space without intellectual stimulation.  There is often no energy in rooms in nursing homes other than the energy of caregivers.  Anything that can be done to give new experiences to people in nursing homes should be welcomed.  Something like 70% of nursing home residents suffer from dementia.<\/p><p>It is a huge issue.  It is a great initiative which I hope becomes really big and I hope it works.  I hope it does not cost the residents in these nursing homes who often pay up to &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 a year for their care.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on a lot of the points he made about communities, supporting artists and making sure they are treated respectfully, appropriately, properly and professionally.  I have met lots of people in the arts who make only a part-time living or one that does not give them a great income but keeps bread on the table.  Any new initiatives we can have to give them sustainable employment must be welcome.  I welcome the initiatives the Department is talking about.<\/p><p> When I look at places like Galway and see the dynamic they have there with the parades every year, I wonder if we can use this pandemic within our local authorities and throughout the country to start new initiatives, particularly in working-class areas.  Many of our working-class areas are concrete jungles infested with drug dealers, drug barons, intimidation and strife.  The energy that people have in those communities goes into protecting themselves and keeping themselves safe and trying to keep away from these people who are around them.  I refer to taking young schoolgoing children and getting an art project going in their community, involving residents' associations.  There are lots of wonderful ideas in these communities.  I came across a gentleman who was an artist.  He was painting his environment where he lived.  He loved where he lived even though it was a concrete jungle and still remains so.  I also note good initiatives from the north inner city drugs and alcohol task force.<\/p><p> If we are to hold on to our young people, especially those who are in difficult circumstances economically and socially, the arts can be a great driving force for them.  Many people love their arts and love to engage.  They just need to be valued more and feel they are valued more.  The respect they need is what we are talking about.  I have met Ms Banotti before and I think I met Ms Licken also in another life when I was in her Department as a Minister.  I wish them well.  I recognise their good intentions.

It is something that we really believe needs looking at.  If there is going to be a reset, now is the time to think about that.  I would also say that to do things properly takes time.  We need to work with the staff in the care home.  It needs to be ready to receive the artist.  It takes time and we want that artist to have time and repeated visits.  If we are going to do something, we are going to do it right.  There is no question that it will spill over into 2021 and beyond.  It is absolutely critical.  We can do better and want to do better in that area.<\/p> <p>  On young people and particularly areas of deprivation where arts, culture and creativity may be seen as something, as it were, not for us, that is at the heart of the Creative Communities programme.

I would like to add to that the chauffeur companies.  They have invested massively in their fleet of vehicles that have sat idle.  These are the guys and girls who collect customers from the airport, bring VIPs into the city and assist the Government around events and conferences.  We sat for the last few days as a D&aacute;il in the National Convention Centre.  A point I made there is that it seats 2,000 people, but with physical distancing it accommodated 160 Deputies.  That is the scale of the challenge that faces events, inward tourism and conference organisation.  Clearly, this is going to go on for some time.

I am very taken with the passion and understanding that all of the witnesses have about the various sectors impacted by Covid.  I was also very taken with what Professor Luke O'Neill said when he was asked about the particular areas that would be most vulnerable in a return to business.  Choirs stood out, pubs where there would be loud talking, shouting, fun and laughter, any kind of singing.  These are very vulnerable areas.  I want to highlight something to the witnesses.  They need to step into the shoes of one or two of these professionals who are involved in the performance area, and it is related to that issue of support.  An email I got from a musician involved says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am a professional musician, some would say a &ldquo;Jobbing&rdquo; musician, whose sole income is derived from 3 or 4 appearances every week - it&rsquo;s my job!!  On 12th March this year, I had a full diary for 2020 - my bit of security, the fact that I was busy.  On the next day I had nothing and like thousands of others stopped completely due to the virus.  There is a massive section of the entertainment industry that is not formally represented by anyone and therefore gets overlooked and that is those of us who play the pub, club and hotel scene every week.<br \/><br \/>The directive that there should be no music in the pubs has been another nail in our coffin since the re-opening.  When The Arts are mentioned the entertainers who I count myself one of, are completely ignored and have no voice.  I appeal that you consider the mass of us (some estimate over 20,000) who contribute in this area, that we be eligible for further Covid payments, until we are allowed to resume work, when it is considered safe enough to do so.  We know that we make a huge contribution to the entertainment business, but it largely goes unnoticed as it is constant and &ldquo;just there&rdquo;.  At the moment many people are seeking extended help - allied to what we [as musicians] do, there are equipment companies who hire gear, there are road crew [there are] riggers, there are the agents who book [the] work &ndash; [my agent has] done nothing, just like me since the beginning of March - this is and continues to be devastating, with currently, no end in sight.  I would therefore please ask you to consider that, if music is your sole source of income [and clearly this gentleman&rsquo;s is], to keep the Covid payment in place until we are allowed to operate again. <\/blockquote> <p>I ask the witnesses to comment on the issues raised in that email.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#W00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's point regarding chauffeurs, the Convention Centre, etc., business tourism is a very important part of the overall tourism economy.  The business tourism that F&aacute;ilte Ireland, working with the business tourism working group, brings into the economy is worth &euro;750 million per year.  It involves conferences, corporate meetings, incentive trips and so on.  It is the lifeblood of the chauffeur business, as well as the operations of many other self-employed workers and SMEs.  It is also very important to large hotels, conference centres, etc.  Business tourism operates with a very long lead time.  We are bidding for conferences and incentive trips to come to Ireland every year from 2021 to 2029.  It is not just located in Dublin because a significant amount of incentive business happens in the south west and the west, as well as conferences in counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Galway and so on.<\/p> <p>  We do not yet have a roadmap for reopening those businesses and that sector.  That is costing us money.  For example, there are the social distancing issues to which the Deputy referred in the context of the number of people the Convention Centre is currently allowed to hold.  We need to work with the public health and other officials to get that roadmap in place because the bids are still happening internationally.  The spend of &euro;750 million per year works out at &euro;15 million per week.

They told us that performing artists were losing &euro;2.9 million per month.  Does the Department accept that figure?  That is the first question.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelly said that 70% of our tourism spend and tourists come to Ireland from abroad in a typical year.  What figure does he anticipate this year?  Even if we have the same number of Irish tourists - I think the number will be greatly in excess of the number we usually have - no one is coming in from abroad.  Will the figure be more than 70%?  Does Mr. Kelly think our tourism season will be extended this year?  Typically, it covers May, June, July and August.  What is the typical tourist season for the domestic tourist?  Will it spill over into September or early October for people who perhaps were unable to go on holidays in May or June?  I realise he cannot look into a crystal ball, but what does Mr. Kelly expect?<\/p> <p>  The regulations introduced by the Minister were published on Wednesday.  They purported to come into effect some time earlier but at the least they were not enforceable before they were published.  They provide that a customer must have a substantial meal.  Does Mr. Kelly believe it will come as a surprise to tourists who come from abroad - I am referring to the few who will make it here - that a substantial meal will somehow protect them from Covid-19?  Is there is a risk that they might believe they are coming onto the set of \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\" or something like that?<\/p> <p>  The legal regulations do not say anything about live music.  Can a pub legally have live music as long as a substantial meal is being served?  What are the recommendations around live music?  When will live music be allowed in bars?

That compares with &euro;5 billion last year.  That is really because January and February were in the bag before this happened.  There is no overseas tourism at the moment.

We have advocated that all partners in the education of our nation's youth must work together to ensure that pupils and students are not negatively affected by the restrictions imposed due to this virus.  The mental and physical well-being of our children must continue to be the main focus and concern for parents and educators.  Commitment, creative thinking and support for pupils and schools inside and outside the classroom, and the financial investment required, must now be demonstrated and forthcoming to assist our children and students.  Flexibility will also be required to ensure that our nation's children are offered the educational supports they need.<\/p> <p>  The NPCPP is particularly aware of the additional difficulties and challenges experienced by many students who suffer disadvantage due to their geographical location, background or family circumstances, those who require additional learning support and those with special needs.  They and their parents need to be assured of the fairness and support they deserve in their pursuit of goals and opportunities to reach their full potential.  <\/p> <p>  Boarding schools also face additional challenges and require guidance and support.  The NPCPP emphasises the importance that we and all parents attach to seeing our students return to normality in education as soon as possible.  Obviously, that will require stakeholders to continue to accept that unusual circumstances and conditions remain.  Flexibility, understanding and a willingness to work together with mutual respect and support will be required from everyone as we progress.  <\/p> <p>  Pupils and students moving from primary to secondary school and those in junior and senior cycle and transition year have already lost three months of classroom and school time in 2020.  Those facing State examinations in 2021 have lost crucial midstream classroom learning and interaction time.  This will potentially have an even more stressful effect than school closures had on the 2020 exam students.  Learning opportunities presented by these enforced changes should be utilised fully to assist towards adjusted methods of education and final assessment.  <\/p> <p>  One of the biggest problems and causes of stress and frustration in 2020 was the lack of clarity due to the unknown and rapidly changing landscape.<\/p><p>We know more about this pandemic now.  We are beginning to function with the virus as a part of everyday life and we are aware of the many of the difficulties it brings with it.  We must plan early and issue timely communications indicating the procedures and processes to be implemented in order to meet a number of possible scenarios.  Doing so will ensure smooth transition and minimal stress for our students, teachers and families.<\/p><p> There is an opportunity - and maybe a necessity - to change the learning or study model as we move into the next academic year and into the future, but school, college and related social and community benefits to our students are as crucial to the education and development of our students as are the academic study aspects of schooling.  The NPCPP appreciates that reopening our schools may present some considerable difficulties in education during the pandemic, and it has been demonstrated how vital it is for the State, school and home to work together.<\/p><p> Inevitably, there will be additional costs attached to getting our children back to school and education while the pandemic still looms large over all aspects of life.  There must be a commitment on the part of the State to meet those costs.  Some key considerations and concerns regarding the reopening of schools include: schools must have sufficient handwashing facilities and availability of hot water, antibacterial washes and hand sanitiser to satisfy hygiene requirements; schools must have induction and ongoing health training for students and staff; there should be a designated, trained, Covid-19 co-ordinator in each school, supported by Covid-19 liaison officers from the Department of Education and Skills, who should be available as and when required; schools must have additional pastoral care, counselling support and professional resources available should problems occur; systems and training should be put in place to facilitate early identification of infection; there must also be adaptability and the supported ability to respond quickly to identified problems or issues in each individual school - this will require input and co-operation from those on the ground and financial and practical assistance and support by the State and the Department of Education and Skills; and confidence in the ability of schools to manage and cope with any future pandemic.<\/p><p> The NPCPP wishes to assure the special committee, and all the partners in education, of its commitment to support the ongoing processes and consultations required to effectively deal with the difficulty presented by this pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mai Fanning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fanning.

The NPCP welcomes the opportunity to make its submission to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response regarding the reopening and operation of primary schools.  While the NPCP believes that there are many considerations in the context of the reopening of schools, this submission will focus on what we believe are the top four key issues.  To support this submission to the special committee, the NPCP conducted a snap 24-hour survey on Thursday last, 25 June, to which 28,744 people responded.<\/p> <p>  The first issue is partnership.  Planning for reopening and operation at national policy level and at school level must be done in partnership with all stakeholders.  While this has started at national level, it is vital that the reopening of schools at a local level also takes place in partnership.  For the whole school community to feel safe in the return to school, children, parents, school staff and the board of management need to have input into the local arrangements that will be made in that individual school context.  Better outcomes will be arrived at when all voices are taken into consideration regarding the challenges and solutions in the local setting.  This may include: the establishment of a stakeholder partnership team of students, parents, representatives from the parents' association, where one exists, school staff and representatives from the board of management; a survey of parents, children and school staff; and agreed local procedures for behaviour, particularly those relating to Covid-19, and adherence to public health advice.  This should all be within the context of schools' existing code of behaviour.<\/p> <p>  The survey looked at several areas concerning local and national planning.  At national level, parents were asked how important it was that their children returned to school fully at the beginning of the new school year.  The survey found that 91% of parents said that this was important or very important, with 20% stating it was important and 71% stating it was very important, while 8% felt that it was slightly important or not important.<\/p><p>At a local level, when asked what was the best way to involve parents in planning for the reopening of their children's schools, 67% indicated that the school should conduct a parent survey and 35% said the planning should involve the parents association.<\/p><p> The second issue that emerged from the survey is the need for all schools to be resourced and supported to identify and assist those children for whom the long school closure may have had a greater impact than it had on others.  This support could include efforts to do with learning, social or emotional impacts.  While schools might already know of children who fit into this category before the closure, children's lives may have been impacted in ways their schools are unaware of during the six months since they will have seen the pupils and their families.  Negative events happen in the normal course of life.  However, under the current circumstances and restrictions, families will have had an increased possibility of being affected by serious illness, bereavement and family relationship issues.  Due to the closure, schools may be unaware of these events.<\/p><p> The survey addressed some specific issues relevant to this area.  Specifically, parents were asked what the impact of a blended learning return to school might have on their child with a special educational need or on children who are transitioning from primary to post-primary school.  A total of 84% of parents who have a child with a special educational need indicated that it would be somewhat or extremely difficult if their child were to return to school with blended learning in place.  A total of 83% of parents responded that it would be somewhat or extremely difficult for their child to settle into their new school if blended learning was in place during transition.<\/p><p> The third area of prioritisation to emerge from the survey is the need for the social and emotional needs of the school community to be addressed in the first instance of schools' reopening.  While curriculum learning is usually the core business of the school, this will not be successful if pupils' social and emotional needs are not addressed first.  The whole school community will need support in this area.  Parents need reassurance that their children will be safe.  Children will need to know they are safe, they will need to reconnect with school life and routine, and they will need support in the changed environment.  School staff will also need to know they are safe and supported.  These are just a few of the aspects that will need attention.  In the initial stages of their reopening, schools will need support and resources to help them through this work.  This should include the existing supports provided by the National Educational Psychological Service in regard to well-being, with adaptations and enhancements where needed.<\/p><p> The importance of meeting the needs of students informed several questions in the survey.  Parents were asked to rate the importance of a number of statements relating to different types of needs.  While the respondents felt all the statements were important, some were deemed more important than others when it came to their child's return to school.  The top statement of importance was that their child should feel safe, followed by, in order of importance, socialising and reconnecting with friends, the child's emotional needs being met, school staff feeling safe, parents feeling safe and, lastly, the importance of children catching up with their academic work.<\/p><p> When asked about their child's anxiety levels regarding the return to school, the majority - 62% - of parents rated their child's anxiety below five on a scale from one to ten, with ten being the most anxious.  However, it is worrying that 3,528 respondents, or 13%, rated their child's anxiety at eight or above.  The survey also asked if parents felt their child would need additional support from outside of the family to help with anxiety on his or her return to school, to which 11%, or 3,085 respondents, said their child would need such support.  Of that 11%, the majority - 64% - felt their child would need individual support from their teacher.  However, 45% felt their child would need professional therapeutic supports to help them cope with their anxiety.<\/p><p> The fourth theme emerging from the survey is that children and parents need certainty about the structure of the school day and school week.  Parents have raised concerns with us regarding the possibilities of shorter days and-or weeks and blended learning.  The logistical minefield such arrangements would bring for families will, in some cases, make it impossible for children to return to school however much they and their parents want this to happen.  The survey looked at specific issues for parents regarding blended learning and how they feel it might impact on their child's motivation in terms of their learning at home.  A total of 72% of parents felt their children would be only slightly motivated or not at all motivated to learn at home, with 28% reporting that their children would be very motivated or motivated to learn at home.  This raises concerns as to whether there would be blended learning actually taking place or if, in effect, pupils would be doing a shortened school week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Lynch.

Much of the discussion has been around what parents are juggling at home, including work and trying to homeschool their children.  What we are hearing from parents, however, is that their greatest concern about children remaining out of school is the social and emotional needs of their children, their lack of connection with school and getting back into school to manage that, rather than the juggling at home which they also recognised was difficult.<\/p> <p>  We definitely saw a digital divide, not just in homes but also in schools.  We saw it in teachers' confidence and competence in teaching through digital technologies.  This period has also shown that teaching is more than just a platform.  It is a human interaction.  It showed that we will not move to a situation where we do not have school buildings and where children no longer go to school and interact and learn with other children.  As learning has progressed, we have seen a lot more teamwork between children, involving creative thinking and exploring and developing together.  These are key to education and cannot be done with children individually at home on their platforms.  The lack of digital access, whether to devices or broadband, obviously had a severe impact on some children.<\/p> <p>  As well as the digital element, what came through as a key point in the survey was motivation around children learning at home on their own.  Even with digital technology, motivation to learn for children sitting at home on their own or with their parents was a key barrier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#JJ00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The finding that 33% of students were not motivated was a telling statistic in the survey.

I ask this mainly as a parent.  Children have been out of school now since 12 March.  Notwithstanding the academic issues and the fact that certain people are more nervous about the risks of Covid-19, it has been a long time since kids experienced the school rush, the basic routine of getting up and going out to school in the morning.  They have been totally isolated from friends, although we are seeing a little bit of a return to normality in that regard.  Many children who might have been at home all the time, particularly children in rural areas, will have struggled with learning from home.  I will return to the issue of learning from home.  What are the witnesses' opinions on the practicalities of getting kids back to school?  I do not believe schools will be able to open in September for five days a week.  As much as we all want that for our children and their development and to allow parents to get back to work, that is not a realistic approach.  What are the witnesses' opinions on that?  Should we consider having a two-day or three-day week for a certain amount of time to ease children back into school given that it will be a serious shock to the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#LL00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The difficulty with talking about children as a collective is that all children are different.  Some children will adapt to going back to school easier than others.  What we need to do is ensure we support parents and schools because we do not know how this will go.  We have never had a situation where children have been out of school with their families for such a prolonged period.  Some children may experience separation anxiety.  Some children will have heard more about Covid-19 than others while they have been out of school and will already be coming back to school with some anxiety.  That came through in our survey and what parents were saying about their anxiety around returning to school.<\/p> <p>  When children return to school it is important that schools are seen as a supportive environment.  As I said, the curriculum should perhaps be put on the back burner for a while.  Reconnecting with the school and teachers and being able to socialise should be prioritised at the beginning.  Different children will find the return to school difficult and it is important that schools approach the issue on an individual basis.<\/p> <p>  Partnership between the home and school is key to all of this.  While this has always been important, communication between home and school is more important than ever.  Planning the reopening needs to be done in partnership between the home and school.  It is important that parents are consulted on how schools are reopened and that their input is sought and included in the plans for reopening.

There were many children in this category about whom we had particular concerns.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of whether enough was done.

We had all the problems that came with the digital troubles, as some families had problematic broadband etc.  One of the major problems communicated by many parents and students was the lack of motivation and the difficulty in trying to find a space within an already full household where a student could calmly apply himself or herself to a project or lesson, for example.  It is difficult to be put into a position like that when the person has never done any form of remote learning.  All of sudden, in March, our students were thrown into this.  There was added stress for students in the junior cycle or leaving certificate classes.  It is a stress that is continuing into 2021.<\/p> <p>  Schools may reopen with full-time school attendance, blended learning or a mixture.<\/p><p>The fact remains that our 2021 examination year students will have missed a substantial amount of their classroom time.  The curriculum needs to be adjusted to deal with that because they will be going back into school and will be expected to hit the ground running as far as their academic studies are concerned.<\/p><p> The other problem we will have within that is the subjects that are not academic subjects but are more practical and project-based and how they will be catered for.  All we can say is that if there is planning into the future we have to look at 2021 and 2022 because this virus will not disappear overnight.  As we do not know what the health guidelines will be in two, three, four or five months' time, we need to have preparation made in advance that will set out a timeline and a structure for the way our education will look over the next couple of years.  It will alleviate all of the mistrust and the stress, both on students and on parents, going into the future if we have a plan in place and if we can communicate that plan effectively to parents and to students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mai Fanning","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Can I add briefly to that?  Regarding home schooling, particularly for post-primary students, one of the big problems we had was that we landed into this without any warning.  We went from a situation where everything happened in school to, all of a sudden, one where nothing happened in school.  Training is critical from that point of view.  We must learn from the problems we have had.  I refer to training for the students as to how they may do some study at home and how that might link with the schools, training for parents to help them understand, because they were simply thrown into the home schooling scenario without any assistance or understanding, as well as training for teachers from the point of view of how they can co-ordinate teaching within the classroom with assistants and perhaps assisted study or study at home.  We are in a position where we have learned a lot about what is lacking.  We have identified, through this crisis, the importance of the link between school and home and how those two must mingle and support each other.  The problem is that everybody was thrown into this with no training whatsoever, at nobody's fault because this virus hit us like a tonne of bricks from nowhere.  We now see the problems and we need to go about addressing them.  People are talking about Covid-19 possibly being around for a couple of years, as Ms Fanning said.  We have got to have ideas and develop structures and training around how we might manage these matters.  The face of education, post-primary and tertiary, is changing hugely anyway so we do need to address those matters, I believe through training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Rolston"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their answers to date.

The overarching issue is mental health supports for young people of all ages getting back to school.  It is one thing to have disruption of four or even six weeks in terms of not getting quite as far ahead in the curriculum, long division or whatever else but the mental health side of this could have much longer impacts.

Even if those children do not all need therapeutic supports, it is clear that supports from external agencies will be vital.  It is very easy to say that schools need to support children's mental health, well-being and emotional needs when they return, but we must ensure schools are supported in doing that.  They do not normally play that role with abnormal anxieties.  It is really important that the National Educational Psychological Service offers additional therapeutic supports to schools that are having particular difficulties with children re-engaging and reconnecting with school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#NN00500","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>That is absolutely right.  When Ms Lynch uses the phrase \"therapeutic supports\", which is featured in the survey, it sounds like it must be something external, expensive and perhaps a bit frightening for those who have not accessed it before.  However there is a halfway house, namely, training in child psychotherapy and play therapy provided through the colleges of education or otherwise.  These supports can help children to settle in and address lower-level issues.  The idea of external professional therapeutic supports sounds scarier than it needs to.  A lot can be done through the colleges of education and the other support mechanisms Ms Lynch has referenced.  This will be the most important element of the reintroduction to school, particularly for the first term.  I would be glad to continue that conversation with Ms Lynch.<\/p> <p>  The return to school and the transition from August to September is a difficult time for lots of children.  This does not just concern mental health or children with additional needs.  I refer also to children with medical needs.  Managers of the neurological unit at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin tell me that every year they make sure they are fully staffed in September because children with neurological issues often experience significant stress.  They tend to present a great deal more in September than at any other time.  <\/p> <p>  I would like the National Parents Council to continue to engage with the Department on a couple of practical issues.  Blended attendances and the dropping off of children must be managed from the practical perspective of parents.  Can the National Parents Council urge schools to organise this on the basis of surnames?  It would be crazy for a working mum or dad to drop off their children at two different times and organise the rest of their day around that.  Jimmy in first class and Jack in second class should be dropped off at the same time whenever they are attending on the same day.  This must be thought about from the perspective of families.  Other care supports will be needed to accommodate periods when kids cannot be in school every day.  Has that come up in the survey or as a concern of parents?  It has certainly been raised with me. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#OO00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Parents have certainly raised that with us.  It is one of the reasons we want schools to reopen fully.  Any form of blended learning will have mental health implications and will raise issues around reconnecting.  I refer also to the family dynamics of trying to sort out multiple drop-offs.  There is a limit to how much a school can manage because sometimes a family's children are not all in the same school.  This is another reason why children need to return to school fully.  All of those pressures and anxieties around getting to school, different class teachers etc. add to children's stress levels when they return and will have an impact on them.  This is not just a technical planning scenario for parents.  Those anxieties and pressures on the family will impact on how children reintegrate at school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#OO00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I anticipate a scenario where parents are asked to drop children to school a long time before classes begin.

Schools are very caring environments.  Long before Covid-19, school representatives have been doing their level best to connect with these kinds of children who, even before the current crisis, had difficulty with school attendance.<\/p> <p>  Schools have had to grapple with remote technology.  That means they will have more ways at their disposal to connect with children who are not well enough to come into school, or are so immunosuppressed that it is not recommended that they do so.

The fifth years and third years have missed an enormous amount of classroom and study time at an extremely important time in the curriculum as it stands.  This will, of course, have to be addressed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the State Examinations Commission for 2021 examinations.  Being able to cover the curriculum completely would be a feat for any student or teacher.  The 2021 leaving certificate and junior cycle will have to be addressed and it will have to be adjusted.  There will have to be provision made given that the entire curriculum cannot possibly be covered in the time that is going to be available to them.

They are critical and we have spoken about that, as have all our colleagues today.  Schools must be adaptable should things happen quickly.

The parents of 5% of children in primary schools are saying - and I believe them - that their child will need a professional therapeutic service.  The truth is that that level of service is not available.  There is already a difficulty whereby much in-school counselling is carried out by people who have more training in career advice than in mental health or psychotherapy.  Is there a need for extra mental health supports?  I refer to stepping up mental health support within schools.  There should be a roll-out of mental health programmes, with professionals running classes and fully trained psychotherapy and counselling services being available within schools.

The connection they had with the previous teacher is not available to them in the same way.  We need to plan to see if we can work something in through the schools whereby children going into new classes have some connection with their old teacher as well.  That may be where they think they can get the most support from.<\/p> <p>  For a long time, the National Parents Council Primary has been advocating for in-school therapeutic supports and an education therapeutic support system.  We need to understand the importance of the school staff - especially the class teacher - with whom children are engaging all the time.  We need to support the teacher through training to enable the teacher to offer the first line of support to children.  That in itself would alleviate the anxiety of some children and some of the mental health problems that arise.  In the first instance we need to ensure support for all children in the system through the class teacher having additional support.

I want to go back to Deputy Paul Murphy's discussion on school transport.  I questioned the former Minister with responsibility for transport, Mr. Ross, in the Chamber some weeks ago regarding support to the bus sector and the public service obligation.  Although he gave a commitment on public sector funding for public transport, he made no mention of funding for all the private bus operators.  In Waterford, three large private bus operators work under the public service obligation for school transport.  They have had no engagement, nor, as far as I know, have they had any update from the Department.  They have written regarding their concerns about capacity issues and social distancing.  The current bus fleet would have to be magnified probably by a factor of three or four to provide the same service.  They do not have the drivers.  There has been no engagement.<\/p> <p>  While we are talking about education and getting children back to school, one fundamental component, which also affects the intellectual disability area, is being missed in that no one is speaking for the transport operators or how they are to provide a service in future.  I call on the parents council bodies to engage, as a matter of priority, with the stakeholders and the Department.  I can see this as one of the legs under the stool that will not be in place when the schools return.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the facilities and the requirements of social distancing.  We know there are many schools in the country, especially in rural parts of the country, that will not manage social distancing and do not have the capacity for it in the schools.  They may get funding for personal protective equipment and sanitisers etc. but they simply will not be able to accommodate the children.  One component of the curriculum, especially for post-primary education, includes the need to try to engender esteem, as well as problem solving and group-think and so on.  None of these things can really be done remotely.  What strategies do the witnesses have in place?

We highlighted on several occasions within our submission, our opening statement and previously the fact that where blended learning has to be used to facilitate teaching of the full curriculum, it should be examined properly.  Training has to be given, as I mentioned before, to teachers, students and parents on how those things can be done.<\/p> <p>  We have the broadband issue too.  This was mentioned a little earlier.

The curriculum needs to be fundamentally shifted and re-examined.  I think of children learning theorems and so on, which many of them may not have the opportunity to use in later life.

The closed school rule for transport was introduced some years ago when a number of small schools in various parts of the country were closed and amalgamated with larger schools in parishes.  The pupils of the small schools were guaranteed transport to the new, larger school, which was known as the closed school rule.  Unfortunately, under the Government before the last, the closed school rule for transport was discontinued, which has caused significant problems in many rural parts of the country.

I would also like some details in respect of PPE provision.  Several schools may have this problem, but I am thinking, in particular, of Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna in my constituency which is located in a rundown, 20 year old, prefabricated building.  According to the news reports this morning, social distancing is difficult and challenging there.  I know the witnesses do not have a magic wand, and many of these issues boil down to money, but when will it possible to give a definitive outline to parents, the vast majority of whom want their children to return to school in September, of the circumstances in which children can return to school and what kind of procedures will be in place regarding social distancing?  I refer to teachers or SNAs in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to children with special needs.  I hear awful stories about July provision.  It is like a tapestry: the front looks fine, but looking around the back it is possible to see the squiggly bits.  It is not working for parents who have children with special needs at home.  By 1 September, those children will have been at home for six months, with all the associated pressures and mental stress involved with that.  If there is a requirement for physical distancing, what consideration is the Department of Education and Skills giving to this issue?  If there is a requirement for all children not to attend school each day because of physical distancing requirements, what consideration is being given to families where both parents are working and to families where the single parent is working?<\/p> <p>  Turning to blended learning, I suppose having a decent broadband system would have created a level playing field.  One of the stories I consistently hear from parents concerns the demand on broadband at home.  It is fine if there is just one person with one laptop, assuming all students have laptops or tablets, which they do not.  What kind of consideration is being given to situations where there are multiple demands on IT at home but only one piece of equipment?  I refer to where a parent is working remotely from home and there is an impact on the bandwidth and strength of the broadband feeding into the system.<\/p> <p>  We take many things for granted, particularly living in urban areas, although two thirds of my Dublin constituency is rural and there are issues with broadband in parts of the area.  We talk about blended learning, however, and there seems to be an assumption that everybody has equal access to these blended learning facilities.  What have we learned in recent months regarding blended learning?  Those are my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#XX00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>There are many questions in that group, and I will try to start with the first concerning testing children for the virus.  There are no plans that we are aware of whereby children will be tested for the virus in schools, other than what is happening with the normal population when people have symptoms.  I am not aware of any other plans in that area.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to blended learning at primary level, the indications we are getting from parents is that it does not work.  It may work better for more independent learners as they get older, but young children are not independent learners yet and the teacher is an important factor in their learning.  Blended learning, therefore, is not always about access to devices or broadband.  It is more about where the child is at in the context of his or her ability to learn independently.  Generally, what we are hearing from parents is that the home school learning happening at the moment is not working in the majority of cases, and it is working less and less as time has gone on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#XX00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Blended learning is probably more of a feature from a post-primary point of view, as we have mentioned.

This is not a criticism of the Department.  It must do what it can with the resources available.  However, emergencies are something that happen, for instance, if a tree falls on a roof or if a window breaks.  That is how it defines emergencies.  There are summer works programmes but none was scheduled to happen this summer.  The hot water issue falls in between, and until now there has not been an administrative scheme that covers things like hot water or even adaptations to schools which are required because of the new circumstances we appear to find ourselves in.  I sometimes wonder how we can find ourselves being unique in Europe whereby schools have gone back all over Europe and we have not.  Covid-19 poses the same threats to the physiognomy of Irish people as it does to Austrians, Danes, Swedes or those in the United Kingdom, for that matter.  However, that is a different issue.

I am very much minded by what Deputy Matthews said, namely, that we need to hear the voices of students, particularly in the context of the question I am about to ask now.  On the leaving certificate, Mr. Rolston stated that second level education is about preparing students for third level and for entry to the workplace.  I agree with him that that is very much the attitude that has prevailed in Ireland since the time I did my leaving certificate some 25 years ago to now.  It is not necessarily about an education in itself and that the leaving certificate is just that moment that measures whether one gets to do the apprenticeship or the course in university or college one wants to do.  Is there confidence among students and their parents in the grading system that has been developed and, in particular, how that will be adapted to a bell curve based on this combination of factors, including how a school has done historically, and of course private schools, where parents can afford to pay very large sums of money and which tend to come top of school league tables?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#DDD00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>The bottom line on the calculated grading system is that the vast majority of people have bought into it.  Everybody has bought into the options.  I should say that the vast majority of people have done so because there are those that either option does not suit or it is difficult for them.  In the crisis, the solution sought was hammered out among the Department, the parents, the students and all partners in education to try to come up with a system whereby there was a reasonable and a fair reflection of a student's work so that they could make progress on to the next phase of their lives.  There is reasonable confidence in it but the bottom line is that when it comes out the far side, it is still not delivered yet so we are still awaiting the calculated grades.  There is reasonable accommodation in that if the students are not happy with the calculated grades they can take a seat at an examination but the knock-on effect of that is that effectively they might have to move their third level course on to the following year and lose out on a year.  In a crisis, those things happen.  Ultimately, when the calculated grades system comes through, as when the leaving certificate results and points come through, there is a facility for appeal.  We were adamant that a robust and transparent appeal system would be in place should any student wish to appeal.

The Teachers Union of Ireland is pleased to have this opportunity to discuss with the special  committee the question of effecting a safe return to school as early as possible for the greatest possible number of students.  We would also, in due course, welcome an opportunity to discuss with the committee these issues as they relate to further and higher education.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious of the fact that, notwithstanding the significant efforts made to ensure continuity and quality of service in an online environment, nothing can match or satisfactorily replace the live setting of a classroom.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is our ambition to have a return to those classrooms as soon as possible.  Until yesterday, we lacked clear direction about social distancing, and this lack impeded progress.  The architecture of schools is predicated on congregating students, precisely what the current crisis demands that we avoid.  Therefore some defined metric regarding social distancing was needed and, as of yesterday, we have that metric and we can now plan accordingly.<\/p><p> The TUI is also concerned that some of the public discourse is peddling a myth that the virus is not transmitted by children.  While there is evidence that young children are less susceptible to the virus than other cohorts of the population, it is also the case that older students have been shown both to contract and to transmit the virus.  Indeed, in a post-primary context the word \"child\" itself is problematic.  To consider students from their mid-teens on as children is, in this context, a mistake.  They are young adults and therefore carry with them, as do other adults, the risk of contracting and spreading the virus.<\/p><p> As teachers our members have a duty of care to their students. As a teachers&rsquo; trade union, we also owe a duty of care to our members.  In both cases that duty consists first and foremost of seeking to safeguard their health.  If Government wants to approach the reopening of schools with realism and to protect the safety of all concerned, it must provide some additional resourcing.  For example, the budget available to schools for cleaning is wholly inadequate, and that is even in a pre-Covid context.  Proper cleaning is essential and, therefore, so also is a proper budget for cleaning.  Principal teachers need support.  Documentation is replete with references to \"the school\": the school will do this and the school will do that.  The school does nothing.  People do.  Specifically, in the context of preparation for reopening, it is assumed that the principal teacher will do everything.  Principal teachers need support, and quickly.<\/p><p> A very significant adjustment will be required in terms of where and how to accommodate students.  If a class of 30 sixth year students, for example, can be accommodated only by using two classrooms simultaneously, the requisite technology for both live and remote delivery must be in place. There must also be a presiding teacher in each room.  The TUI has suggested that to meet the need for additional staff, students in the second year of the professional masters of education programme be fast tracked into paid teaching.  This has happened in respect of other professions.<\/p><p> There are also students and teachers who will not yet be able to return.  An indeterminate proportion of students and teachers will not be able safely to return because of underlying health conditions or because they are otherwise in high-risk categories.  Provision will have to be made for both cohorts.  There are hard-to-reach students and it is common knowledge that this cohort has not been able to engage or simply has not engaged with the online delivery of classes.  These hard-to-reach students often suffer multiple disadvantage.  It must be a priority of the system to have these students re-engage.  Failure to achieve this will result in deficits that will haunt many of them through the entirety of their lives.  Merely reopening schools will not of itself suffice for this cohort.  A structured, targeted programme of interventions will be needed.<\/p><p> Another cohort of students for whom the period of school closure has presented a very particular challenge is students with special educational needs.  For many of them, the absence of the social milieu of the school has been extremely disruptive and confusing.  Customised interventions and supports will be required to re-establish the connections that have been severed.  There may also be a need for atypical timetables and we will have to plan for the possibility of a partial return or a staggered return.  Consideration may have to be given to prioritising certain groups within the school community, perhaps those going into sixth year, first years, or students with special educational needs or those who suffer the most acute disadvantage.<\/p><p> A further consequence of the move from on-site to online teaching and learning is that certain elements of the curriculum have not been and cannot for the foreseeable future be completed.  Especially affected have been practical subjects.  It would seem harsh, even at this remove, to expect students to face examinations next year that assume completion of syllabi.  Therefore, adjustments will have to be made and they are probably best made by using the assessment instruments rather than by specific curtailment of syllabi.<\/p><p> In regard to school transport, while it may be logistically difficult to arrange for students to be transported to school, it is vital that it be done as far as it can be done.<\/p><p>For example, if a student who already suffers disadvantage does not have access to school transport, there is not the slightest chance that he or she will be able to re-engage.  Moreover, in rural areas where there is often deep seated and intergenerational socioeconomic disadvantage few, if any, alternatives exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#LLL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John MacGabhann","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I ask the witness to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#NNN00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":340,"content":"<p>In conclusion, to come back to the matter of safety, the TUI has made it clear that we will operate in accordance with the advice of the public health authorities but we will not put our students, their families, their communities or our members at risk.

I want to make clear that the objective of the ASTI is the full reopening of schools as soon as possible.  While enormous efforts have been made by teachers and students by way of remote engagement since the school closures in March and notwithstanding the digital divide and other issues that have frustrated the efforts of all concerned, it is clear that nothing can replace the vital interactions that take place in classrooms.  However, the reopening must be done in a manner that is safe and enjoys the confidence of all concerned.<br\/><br\/>Our submission outlines the issues regarding the challenges for reopening schools and the procedures that will need to be put in place.  These include ensuring the health, safety and well-being of students, teachers and other school personnel; adjusting the physical infrastructure to maintain social distancing; implementing the return to work safely protocol and ensuring compliance with it; attending to the needs of vulnerable members of the school community; dealing with the enormity of the initiative overload burden placed on schools in recent years and rebalancing the inspection process in schools so that these do not constitute a barrier to an efficient school reopening and the making up for lost time; and addressing the impact on students, teaching and learning and the challenges of potential staggered attendance that may still be necessary for a time.<br\/><br\/>In relation to a blended learning approach, a raft of issues will have to be addressed regarding remote teaching and digital literacy skills.  We need to address, as a matter of urgent priority, the equity issues that were thrown into the limelight in a stark manner after the school closures in March. <b><\/b>Students with special and additional educational needs have suffered enormously during this period.  Their needs will have to be fully addressed. <br\/><br\/>A successful reopening of schools will be predicated on achieving the confidence of teachers, students and parents in the process.  In England, attendance rates have been poor from among those who have been entitled to return to school, purely because parents are not convinced that it is safe to do so.  The ASTI takes a wider view but, as a trade union, we must pay particular attention to the interests of our members.  Teachers, like all workers, must return to Covid-19 secure workplaces.  Nothing less will be acceptable.<br\/><br\/>The report to Government by the Minister for Education and Skills on 12 June caused considerable consternation amongst our members, to put it mildly.  It stated: &quot;A differentiated approach to physical distancing in schools versus requirements for other parts of society or business could be considered appropriate and reasonable when the particular nature of the school environment is considered&quot;.  An inferior approach to physical distancing in schools from that which pertains in wider society or any deviation from the health advice available from NPHET or the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, would be unacceptable.  We have been heartened that the interim advice issued by the HPSC and acted upon by the Department of Education and Skills regarding the operation of summer programmes being provided in schools includes a social distancing regime for staff and students.<br\/><br\/>The ASTI has a significant number of members with underlying conditions or living with others who fall into similar categories.  They worry if they will be Covid-19 secure working in a classroom with 30 students with no personal protective equipment and with weak social distancing or none.  Members are sceptical that this would be safe.  In England, clinically vulnerable individuals, including education staff, are advised not to work outside the home.  Staff in this position should be similarly advised here.<\/p><p>The developing science relating to the virus seems to suggest that children under the age of ten probably pose no threat in terms of transmission of the disease.  However, all students in second-level schools are over 12 years of age and several of the senior students will be over 18.  The science on this issue appears inconclusive.  We believe that a blended learning model of some sort will continue to be needed and that phasing of the return to school may be necessary.  As our classrooms are among the most overcrowded in OECD countries, it seems to us that no matter how creative schools are in using their available rooms and facilities, many will not be able to accommodate everyone on a full-time basis.  Several staff members and students may still have to work or study outside of the classroom because of their vulnerabilities.  Enormous difficulties will have to be overcome in the management of practical classes such as woodwork, metalwork, art, physical education, music and home economics.  Similarly, it will be challenging to manage the cleaning requirements that will be needed between classes.<\/p><p> These tasks will be extremely difficult but not insurmountable.  The ASTI will play a constructive role.  We will engage with the Department of Education and Skills and all other relevant stakeholders to ensure a safe reopening of schools to the greatest extent possible.  Only an agreed set of protocols that enjoys the trust and confidence of all stakeholders will secure that objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#NNN00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Christie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting the INTO to appear on this important issue.  T&aacute; Mary Magner, &aacute;r n-uachtar&aacute;n, in &eacute;ineacht liom.  Covid-19 has had an unprecedented and devastating effect on Irish society, one from which the country may take years to recover.  The repercussions will have the greatest impact on the vulnerable.  Education is a key sector that can play a leading role in addressing the negative consequences.<\/p> <p>  The reopening of schools will be an enormous challenge but our members are unequivocally up for that challenge.  They are facing up to it with the expectation that their views will be taken into account and their concerns fully addressed by the Government in a timely manner.  Priority must be given to the safety and physical and mental health and well-being of staff, pupils and parents in primary schools through minimising the risk of the introduction of Covid-19 into the school community and, if it does get in, properly managing the risk of a spread of infection.<\/p> <p>  Children&rsquo;s learning and development, including their well-being, must be supported by schools.  Schools must have access to the relevant supports from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Those services, in turn,must be ramped up and their capacity increased to cope with the needs of school communities.  <\/p> <p>  A collaborative approach to developing and implementing procedures and protocols at national level is essential.  Although local schools will have to adapt protocols for their particular circumstances, individual schools cannot be asked to develop their own guidance.  Engagement with stakeholders is ongoing and it is imperative that it moves at a faster pace.<\/p> <p>  In order to have a full reopening of schools, there must be a comprehensive level of staffing, including substitution for all absences.  That has not been available since the recession.  All absences must be covered.  Supports to schools must ensure that no class needs to be split among other teachers and classes.  If that were to be the case, the whole system would fall down.  A very good pilot scheme involving substitute supply panels in six areas is being run this year.  This scheme must be extended nationwide to ensure that teachers are readily available to cover their colleagues' absences.<\/p> <p>  Adequate resources must be allocated to schools to allow them to implement the comprehensive health and safety measures they require to operate safely.  Such resources include additional budgets for cleaning staff, equipment and sanitising products.  Account also must be taken of the need for schools to purchase additional educational resources if children are to have their own materials.  Parents must not be asked to pay for those resources.<\/p> <p>  It is something of a national embarrassment that we have the largest primary school class sizes in the eurozone.  Many of our primary school classrooms are overcrowded, with many having more than 30 children.  Our European neighbours have an average of approximately 20 students per class.  This factor really matters when it comes to applying social distancing.  It is crucial that the new Government delivers on its commitment to address the matter.  We need assurances that no school will be penalised if the number of children in attendance on 30 September is below the appointment and retention figure as a result of absences due to Covid-19 or other illness.<\/p><p> We will have to accommodate a changed environment from September.  This must be taken into account by the inspectorate, the National Council for Special Education and other sections and agencies within the Department.  It will be necessary for inspections and initiatives other than those aimed at contributing to the school's efforts to maintain the health and well-being of the pupils and school community to be put aside for the duration of the crisis.  We welcome the announcement that there will be no new self-evaluation next year.<\/p><p> In advance of opening, there must be a communication strategy led centrally by the Department.  This must include a media campaign to ensure buy-in from the whole school community.  Clear advice and guidance will have to be given to students, including smaller children, their parents and everyone in the community.  There will be changed expectations of schools, for example, teaching all parts of the curriculum or extra-curricular activities may not be covered, initially at least.  This has to be spelled out to avoid misunderstanding.<\/p><p> School leaders will need particular supports.  They have played a blinder so far.  Given that we have teaching principals in half our schools, they will need additional leadership days to get away from the classroom in the initial period so that they can ensure the school is safe.  We will also need suspension of the unnecessary paperwork during the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p><p> Staff and students, who will be hopefully returning on a full-time basis, must be assured by Government that when the go back to learning and teaching, every precaution and practical step has been taken to protect them from Covid-19.  They will need certainty that parents will not congregate, as they do usually, at a school.  I am sorry that this has to happen but we must ensure people are not congregating and that an unambiguous message is sent out that this cannot happen.  In the event that any school does not re-open fully or has to close due to a breakout, we need extra facilities for information and communications technology.  We have low investment in computers and technology in the primary sector.  Teachers will not be able to simultaneously teach 20 or 30 children in their class and teach the children who are vulnerable at home at the same time.  There must be extra staffing for that.<\/p><p> Finally, careful thorough and properly-funded preparations must be made at pace in the coming weeks.  We will certainly work closely with the Department.  We have to take into consideration the reality of the long years of under-investment in the primary sector.  We can overcome this with the resources.  We are determined to ensure that everyone in the school community remains safe from late August and September onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#OOO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1593644400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Deputy David Cullinane took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I have taken over in the Chair, for those in the committee room who may be unable to see it.

I wish to put on the record of the committee something I spoke about in the D&aacute;il last week.  In many respects special needs assistants and other school staff believe that the efforts they have made during this crisis have not been adequately recognised.  They have been shown considerable disrespect by the Department in terms of communications on issues relating to pay, for example.  I am not putting that on any of the union representatives present.  I know that they and their members have a good working relationship with them.  For the purposes of the committee, I know they are disappointed that they have not been included today.  I urge the committee to include them in any future hearings.  I imagine this issue will arise again and we will be discussing it further.<\/p> <p>  This is not the biggest issue in the news each day but it is fair to say that for well over 1 million people this is among the most important issues they face.  For the almost 1 million school children and parents and the tens of thousands of teachers and schools staff this is an issue they think about every day.  They are trying to imagine what it will be like in September.  It has been difficult for everyone.  I know that for many children it has been extremely difficult as it has for many parents too.  They are looking at the autumn and trying to imagine what it will be like if the child is only in school one day, two days or three days per week.  Having said all that, I am of the view that it need not work like this.<\/p><p>Some people may seek division on this issue but, in my view, it is the honest objective of everyone involved in the sector to ensure a full and safe return to education as soon as possible.  Is it our guests' objective to deliver a full return to education in the normal way as soon as possible and when will that be possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#PPP00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I will not speak for the other unions but we have been absolutely foursquare about this from the outset.

I cannot answer truthfully and fairly the question as to when this will happen.  We are engaged and will continue to engage with the Department and the other partners to ensure that it can happen at the earliest possible time.  As the Deputy will appreciate, however, and as he acknowledged, this has to be done in a manner that guarantees safety for children, students in the case of second level schools, their parents and families, the broader community and, we say without apology, our members.

We have the interim guidance or recommendations from the public health experts but we also have an additional plan that came about because of very intensive work carried out by management, the principals' group and us, the INTO.   If that plan is to come to fruition for September, the pace of engagement will have to increase.  Now that we have the interim health guidance, it is obvious that primary will be treated somewhat differently from post-primary.  It is obvious that for classes up to second class, the public health experts believe that social distancing will not be as achievable.  We have a particular issue with the older classes, from third to sixth class, when it comes to the large, or super-size as I call them, classes.  No matter what way the maths is done, it will be very difficult to fit 35 or 36 children into an 80 sq. m room, not to mention some of the smaller, older classrooms.<\/p> <p>  The advice may change over the summer, and international comparisons are being carried out with primary schools that have opened in countries where the curve was flattened earlier than in our case.  It will be kept under review.  It is our view that as we enter August, we will work tirelessly, even during our office closure - and I will not be taking any holidays - to ensure we can get this over the line.  The key point from the very beginning from our perspective has been that we are guided by public health advice from Irish experts.  We have had great trust in them as a country.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the 1 million people the Deputy refers to, almost 600,000 of whom are returning to primary school, the key point for them is that if the medical experts determine that the measures and protections are in place, we will all be back, but I have serious reservations about what will happen after we go back.  The committee might come to this issue later.  It is fine to get the schools reopened but the question is whether we can keep them open in circumstances where teachers are absent, and mandated as such because they have symptoms, and where the Department will not fund substitute teachers to cover their absence.  That would ruin the theory behind pods and bubbles.  We will not be able to have classes split willy-nilly throughout schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#QQQ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I will group my remaining questions and ask that all three of our guests respond to them accordingly.  It seems that the process undertaken by the Department began too late.<\/p><p>Documentation produced in recent weeks has answered some of the questions, but without the Department having provided guidance to them directly, schools were left in a significant vacuum and had to use their initiative to prepare.  Are the witnesses satisfied with the manner in which the Department communicated with schools and union members?<\/p><p> Another key issue concerns the costs of hygiene and cleaning.  Some estimates suggest a cost &euro;25 million but I imagine it could be more, considering the costs of factors such as refuse.  How much do the witnesses believe schools will need to ensure costs are not passed on to parents?<\/p><p> Another key issue about which I am concerned is that there are many children who have, despite the best efforts of teachers and staff, fallen significantly behind.  I am aware that teachers have made great efforts.  As a parent, I thank the teaching staff of Gaelscoil an Teaghlaigh Naofa.  I am sure there are many other schools in which considerable efforts were made.  There are, however, many children who will have fallen behind enormously despite schools' best efforts.  How do the witnesses envisage this being tackled?  Is there a role for home&ndash;school liaison activity in this regard?  What do we need to do to bridge the gap that will have opened up?

It is pleasing that he has acknowledged that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy originally asked two questions and I stitched into my statement that it is the objective of the ASTI to have full reopening as soon as possible, provided it is done safely.  Answering the second part of the Deputy's question is tougher because it is not possible for me to predict when this will take place.  There are too many variables of which we are not in control.  The key variable is obviously the social distancing regime.  We received medical advice yesterday.  The position on what is possible might deteriorate or improve as the summer progresses, but we do not know.  Social distancing is the key variable in ensuring that we get pupils back to school.  Our view is that the advice that came out yesterday is such that many schools will not be fit to open on a full-time basis for all students.  They might be open but they may be open on a restricted basis.  That is a simple reality because of the sizes of the schools and the number of pupils who can safely be put into a classroom.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that there is extreme urgency in respect of guidelines being issued to schools and planning.  Perhaps there was time that might have been used better but we were waiting for the medical advice to come through.  Without that advice, nobody was sure what was being planned.  In that context, there is definitely a lot of work to be done in the coming weeks to give guidance to school leaders, teachers, parents and all the other stakeholders in schools.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question on costs, there is no doubt that the cleaning regime alone, in addition to several other aspects that arise from it, will impose an enormous burden of cost on the system.  It will have to be borne centrally because schools do not have the money to fund the regime.  Certainly, we share the Deputy's view that there should be no leaning on the already overburdened parents to fund that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#RRR00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Christie"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I am afraid I am out of time.

Large schools in Drogheda have over 1,200 or 1,300 students.  They will need a lot more staff to be able to manage and ensure systems are adhered to and to guarantee that if somebody needs to be looked after, he or she will be.  I worked in a school with 1,200 pupils, and anyone who stood in their way at 4 p.m. might not last too long.  Large numbers of people will have to be controlled and kept distant from each other.  Will staggered hours be required?  By that I mean will only some pupils go to school at 9 a.m. and others later so that the whole school is not occupied by all of the students at one time?  <\/p> <p>  Students in post-primary schools often move around from one subject class to another.

As my colleagues have said, I also acknowledge the deeply conscientious role that teachers in all strata of our school system have shouldered in recent months.  It strikes me, as I hear them speaking, that it would help to imbue confidence if there was a level playing field.  It can been seen how few of us there are here in the D&aacute;il Chamber so I imagine, if it is expected that teachers will go back to school with some kind of reduced physical distancing, that it would help them to see a D&aacute;il Chamber in September that was kind of half full on the basis of the requirements, as opposed to the maximum of 20 Deputies allowed to be here now.  Our witnesses might have seen the D&aacute;il assemble in the National Convention Centre.  I made the point the other day that the venue seats 2,000 people but managed to accommodate only 160 Deputies with physical distancing requirements, and we kind of filled the venue.  I completely get the challenges, therefore, that teachers are facing.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions I will run through quickly.  Do the witnesses favour temperature testing?  If so and if that type of testing was favoured in particular circumstances, who would carry that out or has consideration been given to that issue?  One of the contributors mentioned proper budgets for cleaning.  What kind of budgets are we talking about in that regard?  It was also remarked that principal teachers needed additional supports.  Will the witnesses outline what additional supports they might have in mind?  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses also referred to the need for provision to be made for teachers who cannot return to work because of underlying conditions or similar circumstances.  What provisions do the witnesses envisage as being required in those circumstances?  In light of the comments made some weeks ago by Professor Luke O'Neill about no-nos in the context of the transmission of Covid-19, including shouting and boisterous behaviour, how would the witnesses envisage playgrounds being supervised, particularly at primary school level?  Have the witnesses' organisations thought about, or discussed with the Department, the oversight of the required health and cleansing measures?  Has that been discussed?  Is that a responsibility that falls on the principals or the boards of management, or is it departmental? <\/p> <p>  Turning to implementing the Return to Work Protocols, did that start before schools shut in the last week?  The witnesses mentioned those teachers who may not be able to return to work.  Do the witnesses have an idea as to what proportion of teachers might not be able to return to work because of legitimate underlying conditions?<\/p><p> I will ask one more question before inviting the witnesses to respond.  I may have time after that for a follow-up question.  Based on the figures we have so far, it seems there may be schools in some parts of the country that do not have to do anything because, as Mr. Boyle mentioned, the curve has been flattened to such an extent in those areas.   Do the witnesses envisage that some schools will not have to do anything?  I have asked a lot of questions and I know the witnesses will not get through them all, but I would be grateful if they could come back on some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#TTT01100","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Deputy Lahart will be very familiar with the largest school in Ireland, where I was principal until last year.  There are particular logistical difficulties for that school, with 1,600 children, 150 staff and God knows how many parents arriving there every morning.  That is a case where there will have to be a staggered opening, particularly initially.  It will not be possible to have a safe reopening on 1 September for a school of that size if all of those people turn up at the gate at the same time.  Things will be different this year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about temperature testing.  The guidance indicates that for very young children, it would not be worthwhile to do it because, on certain days in the winter, from the time they leave home until they get to school, their temperature could have gone up before suddenly falling back again.  Any such measures will have to be done at entry.  The key point in the guidance is: if in doubt, stay out.  Parents will have to make sure that if their child is not feeling well or has any sign of a symptom, he or she does not come into school.  Equally, staff will have to take the same approach.<\/p> <p>  Support for principals is a particularly big issue for us.  With nearly half our schools having small numbers of teachers and teaching principals, we do not believe, in the early days of the school year, that a teaching principal will be able to give full consideration to his or her class for the five hours of the days, plus playground duty, and also be able to manage the safe opening of the school.  We will have to get extra release days for those principals.  We have been asking for a day per week for a long time and we are nearly there in some schools.  The total cost of giving a day a week is &euro;7 million.  We do not necessarily need to have that in place immediately to deal with Covid but we will need a lot of days in September.  We certainly can do the maths on that and get back to the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to playground supervision and all the resources relating to the national return to work protocol, it is all about time.  For example, the requirement for children to sanitise their hands will have to be done under supervision.  How does one supervise the children coming in the door when half of the class have already gone up the stairs to their classroom?  Equally, how can a teacher carry out the role of lead worker representative in a school if he or she is teaching all day?  In the case of teaching principals and even administrative principals, they will be so focused on health and safety that there will have to be extra help and resources provided.  We can get all of that costed.<\/p> <p>  Deputies O'Dowd and Lahart asked about how there will be verification of how individual schools are adapting to the new normal.  The Health and Safety Authority will have a role to play in that.  We hope the schools inspectorate, even though its members might not be health experts, can guide and advise schools in this regard.  We are glad that they have said they will do so.  However, there also will have to be HSA inspections.  If they are happening in every other workplace, why should they not be done in schools?  Our members, including teachers, special needs assistants, secretaries and caretakers, are as entitled to a safe workplace as every other worker.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there are teachers who are really anxious at the moment because they have underlying health conditions.  There are many young female teachers who are pregnant and who are not clear as to whether they will be in jeopardy if they come back in September.  The advice definitely will have to be clearer for those categories of school staff.  At the moment, the guidance talks about, in the context of the ordinary office workplace, what should be done for people in the very high-risk category.  However, those people in offices, who are, no doubt, doing great work, do not have to go into a class with 30 children and meet up to 30 parents in the day.  These are things that must be clarified as soon as possible.  If school staff cannot come back for those sorts of reasons, the principal and the board will need time to recruit replacements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#UUU00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>All three of the witnesses mentioned that a proportion of their members, for legitimate reasons of having underlying conditions, may have a difficulty in returning to the classroom.

We are not asking that they not work but that they be allowed circumstances and accommodations that enable them to work safely.  We will have students in exactly the same boat who, due to serious underlying conditions, will not be able to return to the classroom.

The first relates to health advice.  We do not crystal ball-gaze and we are not medical experts.  We are educationalists and we will stick by whatever advice is given to us by the medical experts, namely, NPHET and the HPSC.<\/p><p>The Deputy spoke of vulnerable teachers, and indeed vulnerable students, but I am going to speak from the perspective of the vulnerable teachers.  In health and safety we already have what is called \"reasonable accommodation\".  That concept needs to be extended to include Covid-related illness and accommodation to that.  Teachers will want to work, be it from home or in whatever capacity; they will want to do it.  In an allied area, in recent years sick leave has been cut dramatically so we need to be cognisant of this issue to allay the fears and stop the anxieties.  We hear constantly about the importance of mental health.  If we can plan in advance and get these issues dealt with, we will save everybody, that is, the management and, most importantly, the individuals the anxiety in this regard.<\/p><p> Deputy Burke asked about the current fifth years, that is, the students going into sixth year.  They are indeed a unique group facing unique problems; their education has been grossly interrupted.  We need to work with the State Examinations Commission to ensure that the break in their education can be accommodated.  That is best done through the assessment tool, as some of my colleagues here have mentioned, as well as taking account of both the written examinations and of the subjects with practical elements.  We need to be inclusive in the assessment tools but to work with the State Examinations Commission in doing that and to do it early on.  We ask that the fears of the students and their teachers be allayed as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#VVV00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre MacDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Mr. Boyle earlier referred to the need for buy-in by everyone.

The rate of sick leave for teachers is very low across the public service.  As mentioned earlier, they often drag themselves in when there is no way that they should be in.  Classrooms can be a great place for the spread of infection, especially in the younger classes with the infants and so on because they are not able to manage it.  We did lose those days of cover for what was known as self-certified illness.  If a teacher develops a symptom on a Sunday evening and is mandated not to go in to work because of that they cannot be penalised in Covid territory.  There is a Covid leave at the moment and that leave is going to have to continue in those cases.<\/p> <p>  That is the first aspect of it but the difficulty for the school under the current arrangements, which have been in place for the past seven or eight years, is that a school does not get cover for that teacher.  Unless this is resolved, there is a lack of joined-up thinking when it comes to Covid because we cannot have a State mandating people to stay at home but refusing to cover for them when they are absent.  The effects of that, as I said earlier, would be classes split and we certainly will not countenance that happening.<\/p> <p>  In addition, when it comes to dealing with the substitution issue, I mentioned the concept of the supply panels earlier and this is something that could easily work in the post-primary sector as well.  We have a pilot up and running and if it was expanded and if ten schools in an area around Bantry or Banteer or anywhere else knew there were a couple of teachers available for certain that they could ring and who were happy to do that substitution, it would certainly help to alleviate the pressure.<\/p> <p>  On the question of buy-in, Irish society has done well since the beginning of March in buying in and people were highly compliant with all those restrictions.  There was a clamour at the beginning to close schools, there has been a clamour now for a number of months to get them reopened, but we cannot reopen them without buy-in from all stakeholders.  When the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Ms Jacinda Ardern, made a decision that parents would not be congregating on school facilities until this virus was condemned to the dustbin of history in her country, everybody bought into that.  People did not go beyond those school gates.  This is not something that we as a union would ever have thought we would be asking for, because we really value the input of parents in primary education.<\/p><p>With regard to the teaching force itself, we cannot have teachers, like they used to, coming to school when they are ill.  If they are ill, they must stay at home, and in that instance we will get buy-in.  It is not in our nature to stay out, but if we are to open schools and keep them open, and I am more worried at this stage about keeping them open, we are going to have to get that buy-in from society generally.<\/p><p> Employers are going to have to give a bit of slack to a parent who is called to a school because his or her child had to self-isolate.  We cannot have a situation where an employer refuses to allow the parent to go and collect the child and as a result that child is left in the school with further risk of the spread of infection.<\/p><p> Buy-in is going to have to be across the board.  Buy-in also costs money.  We hope the Department buys in to those asks about the extra resources in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#WWW00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr Boyle.

I spent 15 years as a second level teacher and I have spoken to many teachers and principals over recent weeks about their concerns and anxieties in the lead-up to a September return.  The big elephant in the room is pupil-teacher ratios.  Anybody involved with education in their professional life will acknowledge that we have always strived to reduce pupil-teacher ratios to an adequate level.  This crisis has highlighted that those attempts have been a dismal failure.  It needs to be acknowledged that had we been more successful in tackling the high pupil-teacher ratios we have, then this difficulty in returning in September might not be the big issue it is going to become.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to six principals over the past two days, and somebody mentioned earlier that one size does not fit all in terms of school buildings and what is there.  One principal described the difficulties they have with the narrowness of the corridors.  Another principal discussed the issues they have with the size of the rooms themselves.  Another discussed their lack of sheltered open space if the weather is poor and children need to go outside and play.  That is going to be another challenge ahead.  That said, it is heartening to see with the various unions that everybody has their shoulder to the wheel.  I have no doubt we can make a success of this.<\/p> <p>  The question I have, and it was hinted at by Deputy Lahart earlier, is in terms of school principals and boards of management not being public health inspectors.  They are not people with a professional background in disease control.  The concern many principals have is the role the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, or public health officials will have in terms of ensuring schools comply with the guidelines that are being set out.

That presents an additional problem in dealing with this, and certainly the space issue is going to vary from school to school in terms of dealing with the return .  The health advice contains a section which argues for the maximisation of space within schools to ensure that as many people as can possibly and safely return on any given day can be accommodated.  We have no problem with that and we support it.  However, there are many schools with narrow corridors, smaller older buildings, smaller classrooms and so on where that is not going to be a particularly helpful suggestion.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the policing of schools and how they are dealing with it, there is, as the Deputy will be aware, a role for the HSA under the national return to work protocol.  Certainly, we will be absolutely vigilant in ensuring that role is carried out with regard to schools.  Obviously, students do not return to work, so there is an additional veneer there.  There is no question about the nature of schools and the extent to which there is interest in them.  We do not foresee a widespread problem, and I hope I am right in saying this, with a failure to adhere to what is required because of the extent to which schools are watched both internally and publicly.<\/p><p>We hope that will not be a particularly major issue.<\/p><p> The key objective we have is to get back to operating safely.

We often deal with class sizes greater than 30 and this is possibly related to an earlier question as to why Irish schools did not open earlier.<\/p> <p>  The recommendations for social distancing indicate it should happen \"where possible\".  As the Deputy states, with junior and senior infants it will not be possible to enforce social distancing but it will be possible in higher classes.  In smaller schools there may be several classes in one room, a teaching principal and undersized classrooms.

I have not seen the interim guidance they refer to but it is clear there seems to be considerable concern about management, cost and resourcing, as well as implementation of safety and new working arrangements.  I imagine many schools will see many more difficulties than others, as they may have existing poor conditions with respect to ventilation, heating control and dampness.  These would already exacerbate respiratory problems with children.  I specifically refer to the use of Portakabins and overcrowding.  With this in mind, I wonder if every school should have a Covid-19 officer on-site and in place to oversee the management of the extra work that was referred to earlier.

There is a question of students not having equipment but what is the position in terms of the teachers themselves?  Is it a matter of consistency in the platforms being used across online teaching?  If, say, one of the software providers was to offer a service like Microsoft Teams free for a year to students and schools, would that help?<\/p><p> In terms of my third question, the witnesses have called for other new initiatives to be suspended while we are absorbing all of this change.

Deputy Matthews's first question essentially had to do with the environment of schools.  There is clearly a difficulty.  Many of the buildings are old.  As stated in my submission, the buildings were with a view to congregating students, bringing them together.  It was largely an industrial model and it does not work in the circumstances of Covid-19.  That is the simple truth of the matter.  There is need for improvement but we are realistic.  Not everything that we ask or wish for, or that others might wish for, can be done in the hurry that is facing us from now on.  The best that can be done is the best that can be done.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked specifically whether each school should have a Covid officer.  Largely, one is working within the staffing structure of the school as it stands, with perhaps some supplement.  For each officer that one determines one should have for a purpose of oversight, one is probably taking one unit out of the teaching cohort.  I am not saying that that should not be done but clearly one has to backfill the gap that one thereby creates.  Mr. Boyle made mention of that.  That transacts differently at second level where one is looking for subject specific substitution, which is much harder to come by, and impossible in the case of some subjects.<\/p> <p>  On the digital equalisation, the Deputy listed a number of things.  I would say it is a case of \"all of the above\", but in which order?  It is a governmental issue, not just a Department of Education and Skills issue, to ensure that the broadband structure is improved, and it is not good at all in some places.<\/p> <p>  There is a matter of training but I have to be fair to all concerned.  There is now a plethora of training available online.  The quality of some of it may not be as it should be, and there probably is need for some quality control of that.<\/p> <p>  I would have a real concern about giving the education system over to a particular commoditised platform.  I do not believe that is necessarily the way to do things and I also do not believe that we should make ourselves the prisoners of any particular product.  That would be ill-advised and might have downstream effects we would not wish for.<\/p> <p>  If I can, I wish to make one observation to do with post-primary schools.  It both speaks to what Deputy Matthews said and what Deputy Lahart asked.  Can we restrict movement by having students in a base classroom in the same place all the time?  We can do that to a very limited extent.  We can do it where subjects are set.  I refer, for example, to where Irish is on for all second year students at a given time.  However, it cannot be done in respect of options and most of our timetable comprises options.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, in terms of practical issues to do with practical subjects, we are going to have to make pragmatic accommodation to ensure that as much of the syllabi as can be transacted over the course of the coming year is transacted.  However, we will have to take account of the fact that, in terms of practical classes where we have multiple users of rare and expensive pieces of equipment, the cleansing regime alone that would be required to conduct such classes will probably not be possible in all instances.<\/p><p>We are going to have to make adjustments to the assessment model as opposed to cutting syllabi <i>per se.  <\/i>We do not want to lose the richness or depth of our syllabi.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#ZZZ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John MacGabhann","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I would like to address the issues relating to the digital divide.  There is a digital divide for students and teachers.  Teachers have to be commended in the highest manner on their exponential self-education in the face of huge need.  They were not found wanting.  The thing they needed and did not have was hardware.  They were using their own hardware or acquired that of other family members by begging or borrowing.  This should not be the case in this age.  We always sell Ireland as a digital front runner.  When it comes resources for education, that is not the case.

Are the witnesses concerned that a vulnerable generation may be lost to the school system because of Covid-19?<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask the representatives of the INTO about class sizes.  Is it reasonable to request that the Government suspend all teacher losses so that no school will lose a teacher over the summer, thereby allowing them to be effectively equipped to deal with the massive challenge coming in September?<\/p> <p>  There seems to be an assumption on everybody's part that children and students are manageable at all times.  Not every Johnny or Mary behaves at all times.  That should be stressed.  We must discuss how discipline issues might be dealt with in a socially distanced environment if a child is a danger to themselves or others.<\/p> <p>  Is it not the case that if the Minister intends to restrict access to education or to school by any enrolled students, she has to refer to section 25 of the Education Act 1998 and must consult patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and recognised trade unions?<\/p><p>Have the witnesses had any contact from the newly-appointed Minister about regulations that will have to issue under section 25 of the Education Act, 1998?<\/p><p> Do we not need a multimillion euro cash and resources package to reopen our schools in September?  The schools need to be staffed, cleaned, sanitised and run.  Other areas of society and the economy will receive justifiable and welcome financial packages.  Is it not reasonable that education will also get a sizeable package, commensurate with the impact that education has in Irish life, particularly on young lives?  We need more than a statement such as the one issued yesterday by the Department.  Money is going to matter when students go back to school in September.  As others have said, we are working together to try to achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#AAAA00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Which of our guests would like to respond?

Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raises an issue that is dear to all our hearts inasmuch as nobody ever wants to see vulnerable students falling out of the system.  We have concerns about that, there is no question about it, because it is a real possibility.  We note that there will be a programme this summer in schools that operate under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  I hope there will be a decent uptake of that programme to try to address those issues but I suspect it might be only chipping at the iceberg, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about making up for lost time, for want of a better phrase.  There are positives within the system.  OECD studies down the years have shown that teachers in Ireland spend more time in their classrooms than the vast majority of teachers in other countries.  Making up for lost time will be, to some extent, happily fed by that reality.<\/p> <p>  There are other means of mitigating what has taken place.  My colleague, Ms McDonald, mentioned that the State Examinations Commission could provide more variety in the breadth of examinations.  <\/p> <p>  I would not discount the fact that an enormous amount of work has been done with the generality of such students since March.  They are not as far behind as people might imagine.  I also might point out that if we are clever in our approach and cut back to the bare bones of what will be important in the coming year, we must consider getting away from initiative overload.  That practice has plagued schools in recent years.  A new raft of initiatives must be dealt with whenever teachers come in for a new year.  We should get back to concentrating on teaching students.  There is also a big role for the inspectorate in providing support.<\/p> <p>  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, is fond of putting phrases from films into his speeches and I will follow suit when I tell Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, \"I like your thinking\".  I like what he said about the cash package for schools and see nothing wrong with it.  We can use any phraseology we want but there is no question that this is going to be costly.  We, and our colleagues in F&oacute;rsa and unions that represent other personnel, will be crying out for proper resourcing for the return to school.  It is not going to be cheap and there is no point in pretending it will be and that all we need to do is to buy sufficient hand sanitiser.  There will be enormous challenges here and the really costly element will not be the sanitising and so on.  I hope the Government steps up to the plate because the necessity to source and provide extra staffing for schools will be essential to maximise the potential of what can be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#BBBB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Christie"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I must bring in Teachta Gannon.

Every document I get from the Department rightly emphasises well-being.  I spent a lot of time in classrooms during my previous career and I am conscious that sometimes we can speak to well-being without actually investing in it.  What type of well-being would the witnesses like to see in schools as we come into September, October and November?  I am conscious that we are dealing with students who have experienced a significant degree of trauma.  That is going to be facing not only the students but also the teachers when they go back to schools.  What sort of well-being do we need for students?  I am thinking of increased guidance counselling hours, or having the National Educational Psychological Service on the ground.  What types of supports do we need to offer teachers?  The teachers I know always take on the emotional well-being of their students but that task is going to increase.  How do we support our teachers to deal with this in the autumn?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#BBBB00500","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1593644400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  There are two different sets of well-being here.  Let us look at the staff for a start.  They were very anxious at the beginning about the closure of the schools.  As they went into facilitating remote teaching and learning, there was a high level of anxiety among teachers, particularly in primary school.  Some were receiving emails from parents at all hours of the night and were correcting work that they could just as easily have done in a classroom in a couple of seconds.  I highlight the planning and preparation that has had to go into that \"new normal\" for the last 12 school weeks.  They are coming into the summer now and, please God, they will get a bit of a break.  The anxiety will rise again as they go back, particularly with all these questions about social distancing.  They are asking if it does not have to happen for them although it has to happen in other parts of the workforce.  There is a new provider coming into the field of education to provide for teachers' occupational health.  It used to be Medmark but a new company is taking over.  A teacher or staff member may be suffering from anxiety or have difficulties, for example, if somebody in their family has passed away over this period or somebody in their family has an underlying health condition.  Then there is the whole issue of facing the students again, some of whom also have difficulties with their well-being, their families and their own heads.  That support is going to have to be ramped up.<\/p> <p>  Then there are the students themselves, particularly those who may be at risk, who are vulnerable or who do not always behave, as Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned.  Some teachers in special schools are going to feel they will need visors, PPE, aprons and gloves.  That is all fine but if a teacher finds himself or herself in that situation, it is a great challenge.  It is always a challenge but particularly at the time of a pandemic.  I mentioned the child and adolescent mental health services earlier, and referred also to NEPS and to advice and guidance from the inspectorate.  A document is not enough.  There has to be personnel available to the schools.  NEPS is always good at a time of a terrible crisis in a school.  For many schools, there will be an ongoing crisis of a kind, particularly in September and October.  Rather than documentation and well-being policies, we need to see money put into that.  More important, we need to see human resources put into schools so that if a teacher has to isolate a child, the teacher is covered and has a chance to get over the trauma of having to bring the sad news to the family that the child, who is only back at school, seems to have contracted the virus.  It is going to be a big challenge.  If the Government wants to pump money into schools and cleaning, that is fine, and I think we will get that, but we need human resources and that is going to cost a lot of money in the first term of the school year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#CCCC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boyle.

Then we were told that PPE would not be expected in schools.<\/p><p>When travelling to school previously, one would often be on a bus with the students one taught.

Specifically on the issue of masks and PPE, we do not have a hard and fast position on masks.  We will be guided by public health advice where that is concerned.  Our preference, to be truthful, is that people would not have to wear masks because a great deal of what is transacted in schoolrooms has to do with eye contact and with the facial expressions of both students and teachers.  Our preference would be not to have to rely on PPE.  If one gets to the point where there is reliance on PPE, and certainly a reliance beyond masks, other than where traditionally necessary and mandated, let us say in practical subjects, then one has a very fundamental problem because the transaction that is anticipated within a classroom is fundamentally fractured by that.  We must wait and see how public health advice develops in order to make a judgment.

Covid-19 has highlighted the great fault lines in public services in terms of education, health, etc.  It has also highlighted the pupil-teacher ratio.

We identified that crisis coming down the tracks and dreamed up the idea of having panels available to cover teaching principals' release days.  The substitutes on those panels were taken up very quickly.  The substitute teachers were given a job for the year and, as such, their employment was no longer precarious.  They covered several schools and gave certainty to everybody involved, including pupils, parents and principals, that absences would be covered by a person known to the school.  Last year, we built on that project.  We established a very successful small pilot scheme entitled the supply panel scheme.  The 18 teachers involved were based in only six schools but covered a total of 90 schools.  It was cost neutral because instead of being paid the daily rate they would have received anyway, the substitutes were guaranteed work for the year.  They were not idle.  Even during Covid-19, they continued to work with their classes remotely.  We think that is the solution for primary schools.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked from where we will get substitute teachers.<\/p><p>It appears to us that it will be from the number of trained teachers who have come back from abroad.  Obviously, they are still waiting for pay equality but they have returned due to Covid-19.  They are not really able to get off the island at the moment and are happy to stay here and help out, just like when the nurses came back to help out.  We want to ensure the teachers who have returned stay here.  We want to ensure they are paid and brought into the primary education system to support us in this crisis and afterwards to get the class sizes down.<\/p><p> I do not imagine there is any concern about teacher supply in the primary sector if it is managed properly.  Why would a teacher stay around this country working when she is not guaranteed more than two or three days in the month?

We do not have an excess of teachers.  We do not have an over-supply.  In fact we have a supply crisis that has simply been anaesthetised for the period of the Covid-19 closure.<\/p> <p>  Two things can be done specifically.  The first is that those undertaking the second year of the professional masters of education course, that is, people who are well socialised into the teaching and school environment, could be deployed, on a properly paid basis, to fill subject-specific gaps across the system.  I am unsure whether this would fill every gap but it would help.<\/p> <p>  The other thing relates to preparation for all of this.  The principal teachers and others in the senior management structures of the schools require assistance.  The assistance, as I said previously, will largely come from within the existing cohort.  We have models that are used for assistance where examinations are concerned.  One scheme was called examination aid.  More recently, it has been called calculated grades aid.  We could have a Covid-19 aid with someone who would have the title of \"Covid-19 planning aid\" with an appropriate and relatively modest budget following that.<\/p> <p>  On the broader issue of streaming classes from some centralised position here, there and thither, there are students who will give feedback and we must have teachers who will receive that feedback, mark assignments and so forth.

Others are related to transport, as part of this was meant to be transport day.<\/p> <p>  It is my understanding that students are asked to pay approximately two thirds of the cost of accommodation in August of each year to secure a place in student accommodation in the coming academic year.  However, based on the uncertainty arising from the coronavirus about returning to college in September and the real possibility that colleges may suspend all lectures at any time, as opposed to attending for two days per week, which is what the colleges are advising at the moment, I believe that accommodation fees should be spread out accordingly for the year 2020-21.<\/p> <p>  The education of the children in schools and colleges is of the utmost importance to the teacher representatives.  Has the Department made provision towards safeguarding students from having to pay for accommodation that they may not have occasion to use should colleges reopen?  The issue is that parents normally have to pay approximately &euro;3,200 in August and the balance of &euro;1,800 in early January.<\/p><p>If it were broken down into four payments, for example covering two months each, parents would at least be out of pocket for only &euro;1,250 instead of &euro;3,200.

In my view, every student teacher this year deserves to have a Covid school experience.  They deserve to get into schools and knuckle down, and not to be inspected in this scenario.  They should be able to find out what it is like for parents, pupils and teachers having to deal with a pandemic, because that experience will serve them well into the future.  It would be a great resource for schools to have at their disposal, as well as being experience for the student teachers.

Schools were closed in Northern Ireland the Friday after we closed.  During that week, there was heightened anxiety because some teachers work on both sides of the Border.  Many teachers who are substituting on either side ended up getting no payment whatsoever during the crisis because they did not qualify on either side.  We still hope this will be worked through.<\/p> <p>  With regard to safety, in many respects the Republic of Ireland's Department is ahead in terms of planning and preparation for reopening because it has the Covid-19 school response plan.  Ironically, however, the Northern Ireland schools are due to open a few days before ours.  There are major differences in the way the sectors work.  We have a direct funding system.  It is totally inadequate in that there is &euro;1 per day for a child in a primary school.  This is hardly enough to get a bottle of hand sanitiser in the current climate.  Be that as it may, it is central.  In Northern Ireland, however, the school budget is given to a school and it has to make do with it.  It is dependent on a lot of money coming across from London.  Therefore, there are differences in the approach but it is incumbent on the new Government to have joined-up thinking on this island.  We take great pride in the fact that ours is a 32-county organisation.  We want our members, no matter what side of the Border they are working on, and the children and their families to be kept safe.  I hope there will be a lot more work done in the weeks ahead, while the schools are closed, to get that sorted for September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020070200002#HHHH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1593644400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Pardon my ignorance, but I do not know whether the TUI and ASTI are all-Ireland bodies.

I understand that there are 17 subjects at leaving certificate level which involve more than one assessment component.  The effect is widespread across a large number of subjects.  What is required is realism.  To be entirely fair to the Department of Education and Skills, it advised us a number of weeks ago that it had by that point begun an engagement with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which is the first port of call in determining not how to tailor or curtail the curriculum but rather how to guide delivery of the curriculum in a manner that is fair to all.<\/p> <p>  Timing is an important issue.  I agree it would be appropriate and the very best for all concerned if a decision could be made as early as possible on whether to go ahead with a written leaving certificate next year.  It is our fixed intention to so do because, as Ms MacDonald said, this year was a once-off.  To be fair to the Department, the engagement has begun.  We are up for that at any point and we will be involved appropriately.<\/p> <p>  I want to take the Deputy up on one point.  What happened this year was not a debacle.  Rather, it was a very structured and engaged process involving all of the stakeholders.  We moved from having no alternative to having an alternative that will provide for our current sixth year students State certification, through the Department of Education and Skills, in a manner that is recognised for purposes including entry to third level, apprenticeships or employment.  In fairness to all concerned, and I include the unions, it was remarkable that we arrived at the situation we did.
