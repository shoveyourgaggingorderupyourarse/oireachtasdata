These schemes make financing more accessible to eligible businesses at lower interest rates than would otherwise be available.<\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was introduced in 2019 to make lending available to businesses seeking funding for long-term, strategic investment. The scheme was expanded in 2020 in response to the impacts of COVID-19 and since then has continued to see strong demand. Close Brothers continues to accept new applications under the scheme, while other participating lenders are continuing to process their &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; of existing applications. <\/p>  <p>  Other state-backed loan guarantee schemes are also in place and provide financing options for both  working capital and investment purposes. These schemes feature optional moratoria, which may offer businesses flexibility as they reopen.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is the largest such scheme in the history of the State and makes available up to &euro;2 billion in lending to eligible businesses impacted by the pandemic. Loans under this scheme are for terms of up to five-and-a-half years and range from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1m. Loans of up to &euro;250,000 under the scheme are available unsecured (except where this is a requirement of the product feature, as in the case of asset finance, invoice discount facilities, etc).  As a result of the high level of the State guarantee, loans are being provided at interest rates lower than the current market rate for similar loans. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants may also avail of an optional interest and\/or capital moratorium, depending on the finance provider&rsquo;s assessment of an application.<\/p>  <p>  For micro-enterprises, the COVID-19 Business Loan from MicroFinance Ireland is open to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic. Loans under this scheme range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000 and are typically for terms of up to three years. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme features a six-month interest and repayment moratorium, with the loan to be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. There is also a Government rebate for the interest paid on the loan in months 7-12 of the loan.<\/p>  <p>  Work is also under way on the delivery of a Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, subject to the necessary legislation being in place, which will make up to &euro;330m in lending available to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses, including primary producers. Loans under this scheme will be for terms of up to six years, and will range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured.<\/p>  <p>  As businesses look toward reopening, I am conscious that many will have new and unforeseen liquidity needs after a difficult year. I would encourage eligible businesses to consider the loan guarantee schemes outlined above as they consider both the immediate liquidity required to reopen and investment for the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900083#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900083#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[26728\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900083#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the reason his Department will not provide for an independent and impartial investigation of allegations of a pro-employer bias in the senior management of the State's labour inspectorate as contained in protected disclosures from person (details supplied) made to the Director General of the WRC in 2015 and to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in 2017.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>I'm informed that the individual in question made a protected disclosure to my Department related to alleged wrongdoing in the Labour Inspection services of the WRC.

The Department held a competitive call for applications to this Fund, which closed on 17 July 2020, in response to which over 100 applications were received. 16 'Strand 1' projects, announced in September 2020, have concluded grant agreements with the Department, to a total value of &euro;1.2m.<\/p>  <p>  Provisional offers have been issued to a further 47 successful applicants through &lsquo;Strand 2&rsquo;, with a funding provisional value of &euro;27.8m. There have been no pre-funding or drawdown requests made for strand 2 projects as the Department is currently in the process of finalising grant agreements with these projects. &euro;11 million has been allocated to the Just Transition Fund through my Department's Vote in 2021. I expect that a significant quantum of funding will issue to projects towards late 2021 and early 2022 as projects incur spend and seek reimbursement.Allocations in future years will depend on the total funding requirements for all projects that conclude grant agreements with my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Strand 1 projects have reported to my Department that they intend to create 28 full-time jobs and that 175 indirect jobs will be supported as a result across the eligible eight counties included in the Just Transition Fund: East Galway, Kildare, Laois, Longford, North Tipperary, Offaly, Roscommon, Westmeath.  This funding has also leveraged &euro;383,000 in additional funding in the region. Once grant agreements have been finalised, the Department will report on expected job creation numbers by 'Strand 2' projects. <\/p>  <p>  A number of projects funded under Strand 1 and planned under Strand 2 intend to provide support for up-skilling, retraining and educational opportunities. All projects will be required to report annually to my Department on their implementation and information on the number of individuals supported in this respect will be included in this reporting where relevant. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Just Transition Fund, the Government is also investing significant further funding in the Midlands Region to support a just transition. The Government approved funding of &euro;108 million for Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s large-scale peatlands restoration project, which will see Bord na Mona reassign employees from peat harvesting activities into rehabilitation operations, while supporting the natural environment and biodiversity of the peatlands. This plan and the National Parks and Wildlife Service Peatland Scheme willsupport350 jobs. Taking seasonality into account, this equates to 230 full-time equivalent roles. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is delivering the &euro;20 million Midlands Retrofit Programme, through which at least 750 Local Authority homes will benefit from retrofitting works by the end of 2021. Home retrofits are highly labour-intensive so this investment will drive expansion of labour activity in the construction\/ retrofit sector, leading to preservation of existing, and creation of new, jobs. <\/p>  <p>  A Territorial Just Transition Plan is being prepared by my Department to avail of up to &euro;77 million in EU funding from the EU Just Transition Fund with a similar level of match funding from the Exchequer over the period to 2027. It is expected that a significant element of this will be committed to eligible projects in the Midlands supporting employment in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900083#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":51,"content":"<p>Question No. 65 answered with Question No. 64.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":52,"content":"<p>Question No. 66 answered with Question No. 64.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[26845\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900083#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the next just transition progress report will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>The Government appointed Mr Kieran Mulvey as Just Transition Commissioner in November 2019 to facilitate discussions and work with stakeholders to develop, mobilise and deliver opportunities for the Midlands for both the workers directly affected and the wider community.

These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021. In 2020, Irish airlines and airports availed of over &euro;200 million through these supports. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  As regards supports specifically targeted at the protection of employment, the Employment Wage Subsidy Schemes (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment amid these very challenging times.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically  for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure; an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of &euro;1.8 million per beneficiary; and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies.  <\/p>  <p>  This scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and to make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19, and my Department hopes to begin disbursing compensation soon. <\/p>  <p>  It cannot be excluded that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout this summer season.<\/p>  <p>  My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis. On 5  March 2021, I chaired a special meeting of the Steering Committee of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum. A sub-group of the NCADF, specifically tasked with developing an Aviation Restart Plan at the meeting on 5 March, submitted a report dated 14 April with proposals that they believe will best provide for the restart and recovery of the aviation sector in Ireland. I will review this report, its proposals, the additional information on operational readiness requested, and I will also engage with other Ministers and Government as required. <\/p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, an aviation sub-group has also been charged with looking at the needs of the aviation sector in Ireland in the context of the impact of COVID-19. This sub-group, which I chair, is attended by delegations from labour and employer representative bodies. This sub-group is examining a proposal for a special extended Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme specifically for the aviation sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy. It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we are committed to progressing the work that will allow the sector to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900084#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900084#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[26807\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900084#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when he expects to introduce the legislation for the regulation of escooters and ebikes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>My intention is to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government this year.

It focuses primarily on business eligibility, delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis to the employer. The objective of the EWSS is to support businesses, encourage employment and help to maintain the link between employers and employees. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. <\/p>  <p>  The EWSS &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by Covid-19 by requiring a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations. The primary employer qualification for the EWSS is based on the employer's turnover in the current six-month period being less, compared with the same pre-pandemic position period in 2019. The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that it is operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from 1 January to 30 June 2021 compared with the equivalent period in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  To answer the specific point raised in the Deputy's question, the turnover qualification requirement for EWSS applies regardless of whether the business is required to close fully or partially due to public health restrictions, or indeed if the business could remain open throughout the pandemic. The &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; is the determining factor as regards eligibility for the EWSS and accordingly, the business must have suffered at least a 30% decrease in its turnover and this disruption is due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS is designed to be flexible for the employer and take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover so if there is a reduction in turnover in the future because of a change in circumstance the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that later period.  <\/p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  With easing of restrictions in the coming weeks, the CRSS will remain available to any business still closed\/restricted under public health guidelines.  Any business which can fully reopen but chooses not to will not be eligible for the CRSS. <\/p>  <p>  It will not be sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.<\/p>  <p>  A business that can partially reopen, for example a pub or restaurant which is permitted to open for outdoor dining only, can still avail of CRSS once they do not exceed 25% threshold for eligibility (25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business). <\/p>  <p>  Any business currently availing of CRSS and that can now reopen as restrictions are eased will be able to avail of double restart week payments for two weeks subject to the statutory maximum of &euro;5,000 per week to support them in meeting the costs of reopening as they exit the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed guidelines on the operation of the CRSS are available on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions. Businesses not falling within the scope of the CRSS may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).

The liabilities being warehoused will be subject to lower interest rates (0% for the first 12 months and 3% per annum thereafter) until the liabilities are paid.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme allows for the deferral of collection of certain tax liabilities relating to &ldquo;Period 1&rdquo;.  The liabilities that may be deferred or &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; are VAT, PAYE (Employer) liabilities, overpayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy (&ldquo;TWSS&rdquo;) due to be refunded to Revenue by employers and certain self-assessed income tax liabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  Period 1 for income tax warehousing is linked to the income tax pay and file date.  In the case of VAT, PAYE (Employer) liabilities and overpayments of TWSS, Period 1 is linked to the date on which a business recommences trading.  This date may be the date on which a business ceases to be subject to restrictions provided for in regulations made under sections 5 and 31A of the Health Act 1947, or where a business does not recommence trading following the easing of restrictions, the date on which it reopens, following the lifting of restrictions.  <\/p>  <p>  As stated, warehousing of tax debts will not cease immediately following the lifting of restrictions or the recommencement of trading. Warehousing for VAT, PAYE (Employer) liabilities and overpayments of TWSS allows taxpayers to warehouse liabilities in respect of a further full bi-monthly VAT period following the recommencement of trading.  This is to allow businesses additional time to get back on their feet after reopening.  Depending on when restrictions are lifted, this may permit warehousing of liabilities for over three additional months after a business recommences trading (for example, where a business recommenced trading on 17 May 2021, liabilities relating to May, June, July, and August 2021 may also be warehoused). <\/p>  <p>  Although no further liabilities may be warehoused after the expiration of Period 1, businesses are not required to make payment of any warehoused liabilities at this time.  Following the end of Period 1, businesses are afforded a period of 12 months (&ldquo;Period 2&rdquo;) during which there is no requirement to make any payment of the warehoused liabilities and no interest will arise. However, this is conditional on the business filing and paying current liabilities as they fall due. <\/p>  <p>  In &ldquo;Period 3&rdquo;, the final period of the scheme, payment of warehoused debt will start and the debt will attract a reduced interest rate of 3% per annum (compared to 8% for income tax and 10% for the other taxes in the scheme) until payment has been made in full.  To avail of the reduced interest rate, businesses in the scheme are obliged to contact the Collector-General before the end of Period 2 to agree arrangements for the payment of warehoused debt.  This allows the Collector-General and the taxpayer to devise a tailored repayment plan over an agreed duration, that takes account of the taxpayer&rsquo;s individual circumstances. The terms of the agreement must also provide that current liabilities are met as they fall due.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy, and businesses availing of the warehousing scheme, that Revenue have been very proactive in helping businesses through the pandemic. At the very outset of the pandemic Revenue suspended enforcement action and debt collection; this then evolved into the unprecedented initiative to introduce debt warehousing. The sole purpose of these initiatives was to give viable businesses the opportunity to survive the economic shock of the pandemic and to help as many as possible to survive and hopefully thrive as the economy recovers. The scheme is also structured to support cash-flow as businesses re-open by allowing the businesses to warehouse PAYE and VAT liabilities for the initial months as restrictions are lifted, as set out earlier. The scheme then provides a further year at zero interest rates to allow the businesses solidify their recovery. <\/p>  <p>  Taxpayers availing of debt warehousing are contacted regularly by Revenue to advise them of the liabilities warehoused and their obligations under the scheme, which include the filing of all required returns and payment of other liabilities.  More generally, throughout the pandemic, Revenue has provided advice and updates to taxpayers and their agents through the Revenue website, press releases and e-Briefs.  I refer the Deputy in particular to the information booklet available on the Covid-19 hub on the Revenue website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[27037\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide a schedule of the 11 sites that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na estates section evaluated as part of its preparation to relocate from the Harcourt Square, Dublin 2 buildings in 2014; the engagements his officials had with the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its estates section regarding the evaluation of these sites; and if a site (details supplied) on the Long Mile Road, Dublin 12 was discussed between his officials and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a favourable option.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[27039\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason for his officials' decision not to embark on the use of privately owned lands to accommodate the new Garda building currently being constructed at Military Road, Dublin; and if he will provide the initial and final schedules of identified sites that displayed potential to acquire and built on.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[27034\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the methodology used to identify 11 potential sites that the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na evaluated in respect of planning for a new Garda building being constructed on Military Road, Dublin; the weighting and or scores that were given to each site; and if a schedule will be provided of the 11 sites initially identified for potential use.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[27035\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the OPW sought a valuation and made inquiries regarding the purchase of a site (details supplied) on the Long Mile Road, Dublin 12; and if he will set out the engagements the OPW had with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of this site.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[27038\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the engagements the OPW had with the Department of Justice in respect of the use of Thornton Hall as a potential site to be used for new Garda buildings; and if he will provide a schedule of correspondence between the OPW and the Department of Justice in respect of same.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[27040\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900085#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the OPW received any objections in respect of the decision to use the Military Road site from management and or the estates section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 95, 99, 100, 102 and 103 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware from answers given to Questions 37-39, on 29th April 2021, a tri partite evaluation panel was established in order to identify an alternative location for the Garda operations based in Harcourt Square. Following a detailed assessment of the six shortlisted sites by the evaluation panel, Military Road was identified as the clear winner and the Long Mile Road site was only rated fourth out of the six sites. While an exercise had been conducted on the potential acquisition cost of the Long Mile Road prior to the evaluation panel meeting, no further action was required in connection with that site. The ownership of a potential site is an important issue in terms of cost benefit and availability to meet project timelines. Public owned sites have significant cost benefit. In the case of Military Road this benefit was further enhanced by it meeting all the key Garda requirements. The Long Mile site you refer to had additional cost and technical issues quite aside from its less than optimal location.<\/p>  <p>  An  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was represented at the evaluation panel by a Deputy Garda Commissioner and the Head of its Estate Management Section and it is fully supportive of the decision to relocate the Garda operations from Harcourt Square to Military Rd.

Thornton Hall, while in State ownership, had location and other issues when subjected to detailed investigation by the tripartite evaluation panel.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution.

In accordance with section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966 local authorities are legally responsible for the management and maintenance of their housing stock. Local authorities also have a legal obligation to ensure that all of their tenanted properties are compliant with the provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 2019. Local authority officials and elected members have a very important role to play in this regard by making adequate budgetary provision for housing repairs and cyclical maintenance utilising the housing rental income available to them as part of the annual budgetary process.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the legal obligation on local authorities to manage and maintain their own stock, my Department does provide annual funding support to local authorities for management and maintenance under a number of funding programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Voids Programme, my Department has supported local authorities in refurbishing vacant social homes and returning them to productive use. This funding programme was introduced in 2014 and has to the end of 2020 returned 16,102 properties to use with funding of &euro;229m from my Department. Kerry County Council has received funding of &euro;6.9m to support the return to productive use of 633 properties under this programme. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department rolled out the largest ever voids funding programme. With additional funding of &euro;40m secured by me under the July Stimulus Programme. Funding of &euro;58.3m was made available to local authorities which saw 3,607 vacant properties funded last year. Under the July Stimulus programme, Kerry County Council were approved for funding of &euro;1,129,100 for the refurbishment of 61 properties.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Energy Efficiency Programme, my Department funds the carrying out of retrofitting works to local authority dwellings. Over the period 2013 to 2020 over 73,500 units of social housing stock have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;161 million under the scheme (most of which were completed under Phase 1 outlined below). <\/p>  <p>  From 2013-2020 the Programme was implemented in 2 Phases: Phase 1 Attic Insulation\/Cavity Wall Insulation and Phase 2 focuses on the fabric upgrades to dwellings. To-date Kerry County Council has received &euro;2,241,349 in funding under the Programme for the retrofitting of 1,673 properties, of which &euro;582,282 relates to the period 2017 &ndash; 2020 and includes the retrofit of 517 properties. <\/p>  <p>  The Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme for 2021 is a newly revised Retrofit Programme and this is the first year of a ten year programme that sees a significant upscaling (from &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; to &lsquo;deep retrofit&rsquo;) on what has been completed by local authorities to date. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding made available for insulation, windows &amp;amp; doors, with a significant increase for the upgrading of the heating system, specifically for the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works (the revised programme no longer supports the installation of boilers). <\/p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;65m has been made available for Energy Efficiency retrofitting in 2021, this includes &euro;20m for the Midlands Retrofit Programme. The programme targets 2,400 social homes for upgrade works in 2021, 750 of which relate to the Midlands retrofit Pilot. Allocations have just recently been issued to local authorities with Kerry County Council receiving an allocation of &euro;1,380,511 along with a requirement to retrofit a minimum number of 51 properties.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Disabled Persons Grant Scheme my Department funds local authorities in carrying out necessary adaptation works to local authority properties to cater for the needs of elderly and disabled tenants and families living in overcrowded conditions in local authority properties. Since 2011 my Department has provided funding of &euro;3.63m to Kerry County Council under this programme. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Regeneration Scheme, my Department funds programmes of estate regeneration in a number of targeted areas around the country. This programme focuses on the remediation and upgrade of existing local authority homes within defined areas of disadvantage and can also provide for some new homes as part of the overall regeneration plan for the area. Kerry County Council has the Mitchels Boherbee regeneration programme in Tralee. My Department has provided funding of some &euro;38 million to Kerry County Council under this programme, with some projects yet to be completed.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided funding of some &euro;50 million to Kerry County Council under the above stock improvement schemes. However, work is also ongoing with the local authority sector, through the City and County Management Association, to drive a planned maintenance approach to the maintenance of local authority housing stock. This will see all 140,000 local authority social housing properties surveyed to determine their condition so as to inform future work programmes and ensure the available funding is spent in a strategic and focussed way. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to fund local authorities for stock improvement works but it is also important that local authorities increasingly seek to move to a position of increasingly planned maintenance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900087#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900087#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[27110\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900087#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of a programme (details supplied) in tabular form including project status spend to date and the estimated timeline for completion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The table below sets out project progress status, amount of funding recouped by my Department (DHLGH) and the projected completion date by year, as estimated by the local authority, for schemes\/projects under the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme (MARWP) for Mayo County Council as referred to in the details supplied.<\/p><p><b>GWS<\/b>(Group Water Scheme), <b>CWC <\/b>(Community Water Connection),<b>LA<\/b>(Local Authority)<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900087#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900087#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[27114\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900087#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the expenditure in each of the past ten years to date specifically devoted to affordable house building where the purchaser has unimpeded access to the market without the intrusion and competition of investment funds; the number of families housed by the local authorities in the same period; the number of local authority loans issued under the specialist disability accommodation or rebuilding Ireland scheme in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society.

As such, I have no role in the granting of exemptions.  <\/p><p>Any pupil who does not meet the criteria for an exemption from the study of Irish should be provided with a differentiated approach to language learning and any other supports in accordance with Guidelines for supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools and with Special Educational Needs: A continuum of Support.  Schools are required to address a wide diversity of needs by providing a differentiated learning experience for pupils\/students in an inclusive school environment.  All pupils\/students should be encouraged to study the language and achieve a level of personal proficiency that is appropriate to their ability.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Primary Language Curriculum (PLC) is for children of all abilities in all school contexts and is informed by the principles of inclusion and the benefits of bilingualism for all pupils.  The PLC recognises and supports pupils&rsquo; engagement with Irish and English at different stages and rates along their language-learning journey. It builds on the language knowledge and experience that pupils bring to the school. The Progression Continua in the Primary Language Curriculum provide a framework for teachers to identify the pupil&rsquo;s stage of language development and to plan interventions that support the development of language skills and competences in Irish and in English in an integrated manner, emphasising the transferability of language skills across languages.<\/p><p>A psychological or medical professional&rsquo;s report is no longer a requirement for granting an exemption from the study of Irish.  Such a report may be helpful to the school in considering how they are meeting an individual pupil&rsquo;s needs but is not the deciding factor for the Principal to grant an exemption.  When schools receive reports from a psychologist or other specialist recommending an Irish Exemption, the onus is on the school to consider their own testing and the pupils performance in school. This is the evidence required by the circular.<\/p><p>In relation to stress and anxiety, schools can best promote the wellbeing of students through a multi-component, preventative, whole school approach. In line with best practice, The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) encourages schools to adopt a whole school, continuum of support approach to provide for children and young people&rsquo;s wellbeing needs. This involves three levels: Support for All, Support for Some and Support for Few. <\/p><p>The area of wellbeing and the promotion of positive mental health is one to which the Department of Education affords particular priority. In this regard my Department is committed to responding to the challenges our young people face today and their need for education in the area of wellbeing and stress. My Department has published a Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2018-2023) for all schools to promote student wellbeing using a holistic and integrated approach here. It is important to point out that schools are already doing a lot to equip children with the knowledge, skills and competencies to enhance their wellbeing and deal with challenges. The Wellbeing Policy builds on this good work.<\/p><p>Schools are being supported to engage in a collaborative process of change, working with staff, students and parents to improve practice in 4 specific areas of school life that we know impact upon wellbeing &ndash; culture and environment, policy and planning, teaching and learning and relationships. My Department is providing schools with a number of resources to support this process and help them to develop their wellbeing practices. Details of the wellbeing policy are available here: <\/p><p>In addition, the National Educational Psychological Service of my Department (NEPS) has developed some useful resources for students, parents and teachers, to support students who are experiencing anxiety. These are currently available on their webpage:  . There are further resources available the National Council for Guidance in Education (NCGE) website   .<\/p><p>I would encourage the parents to engage with the school in relation to all these resources.<\/p><p>My Department has provided additional guidance for schools in relation to applications for an exemption from the study of Irish under Section 2.2.a. of Circular 0053\/201, in circumstances where pupils enrolled from abroad for the first time into 5th or 6th class in a school in Ireland during 2019\/20, or into 6th class during the 2020\/21 academic year.

A key focus of these themes is that they are targeted at those pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage.

The allocation of this funding is applied equally to rural and urban schools in DEIS.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, all DEIS Urban Primary and DEIS Post Primary schools are included in the HSCL Scheme, which serves over 530 schools. The scheme is delivered by 415 full-time HSCL Coordinators who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 160,000 pupils.

The scheme plays a vital role in supporting the development of new enterprises for the long term unemployed and is payable for a 24 month period from the commencement of their new business.  The scheme is not designed to support existing business ventures.<\/p>  <p>  The BTWEA was extended in response to Covid-19 where the qualifying period was waived for people applying from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) to start a new business.  The BTWEA is payable at the weekly rate of Jobseekers Allowance appropriate to the individual.

Where a self-employed person exceeds this threshold they may apply for the Part Time Job Incentive for the self-employed.  This enables a self-employed person, who has been in receipt of the PUP, to engage in self-employment for up to 24 hours per week and receive a personal weekly rate of payment of &euro;128.60.  There is no income threshold applied under this support. <\/p>  <p>  The Covid-Enterprise Support Grant is also available to eligible self-employed recipients who close their PUP and re-open their business.  A once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000, to assist with the costs associated with reopening, is available under this measure.  In excess of 9,000 applications have been approved since the introduction of this grant, with funding nearing &euro;8.5m paid to small businesses.

Dinner clubs provide a hot meal, but are different from the Hot Meals clubs, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities whereas food for Hot Meals clubs is cooked offsite and either delivered hot or reheated in the school.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the scheme since the introduction of DEIS in 2005 but their level of funding has been capped at the same rate year on year to allow for the concentration of the scheme on DEIS schools. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019\/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  My Department issued invitations for expressions of interest to 705 primary schools in November 2020.  A total of 281 expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.<\/p>  <p>  The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  <\/p>  <p>  As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected. <\/p>  <p>  Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary. Schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of the school year.  Applications are accepted from individual schools and organisations as well as organisations such as School Completion Programmes who apply for multiple schools.  The application process for 2021\/2022 will open at the end of the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  There were 1,350 applications for funding for the 2020\/2021 academic year, in respect of 1,398 schools and organisations.  Of the 1,350 applications; 1,336 are awarded, 4 are pending further information from schools and 10 have been disallowed because they were from an organisation or school other than a DEIS school.<\/p>  <p>  In general schools apply for more than one food club. 281 dinner clubs and 947 lunch clubs were applied for in the 2020\/2021 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  276 Dinner clubs have been awarded, 1 is pending further information from the schools and 4 have been disallowed.<\/p>  <p>  933 lunch clubs have been awarded, 3 are pending further information from schools and 11 have been disallowed.<\/p>  <p>  Clubs are disallowed where funding for that club in addition to other clubs being applied for would bring the level of funding over the maximum amount available. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900089#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[26754\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051900089#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on whether the lottery system that has been implemented in the school meals scheme is a blunt instrument that does not adequately recognise the individual needs of schools and the areas that they serve; if her attention has been drawn to two schools (details supplied) that both applied for funding to provide hot meals to students only for the senior school to be awarded such funding while the junior school was not; her views on whether this is acceptable; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1571","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefitting 230,000 children.

With regard to the residency criterion, in order to be eligible for a grant, a \"student\", as defined in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011, must demonstrate that he\/she has been resident in the State for at least three years out of the five year period ending on the day before the start of his\/her approved course of study. The three out of five year rule takes cognisance of students who wish to take time out to travel or work abroad.

Rates of duty applicable to licence renewal are applied by the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Acts.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and I am advised by the Courts Service that there has been a 73% decrease in the number of licences issued in 2020 compared to 2019. This is predominately due to the reduction in special exemption orders which permit extended opening hours. Such special exemption orders are required to be obtained for each individual night of extended opening hours, therefore, this substantive decrease is a direct result of the extended closures due to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the unique circumstances which licence holders find themselves in as a result of COVID-19 and of the importance of helping and supporting these businesses as they get back on their feet.

Further to this, the District Court (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2020, waived court fees for specified pub and other liquor licences in 2020.

The backlog in shellfish licensing has now been eliminated as an issue affecting the industry. The elimination of the backlog was achieved using existing resources within the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Key amongst the Review Group recommendations was the development of a &lsquo;Web-based Aquaculture Application and Monitoring System&rsquo; on a single portal which would be integrated with scientific and technical data sets from both the NPWS and MI databases. This recommendation is progressing in the form of the Departments AQUAMIS (Aquaculture Management Information System) which is being progressed in two phases as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Phase 1 (2020 &ndash; 2021): Development of AQUAMIS as a largely internal system that will allow DAFM and the Marine Institute to work together to develop a spatially-enabled licensing system. This allows applicants and the public to view licensed aquaculture sites and mapping information through a public portal. This 16-month project will be completed by the end of 2021. The implementation of this recommendation is being funded through a European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) grant.<\/p>  <p>  Phase 2 (2022 &ndash; 2023): Once the Phase 1 system is operational, it will be further developed over an approximate 24-month period to become a fully online system with all application information and supporting data being submitted electronically. This system will also be integrated into other Government systems, such as the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) online portal and the wider marine spatial planning system, which is also likely to be hosted by the Marine Institute.

The licensee may decide to afforest or to fell a smaller area, or indeed, not carry out the licensed operation at all.  Furthermore, the area applied can vary and remains an individual choice.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, afforestation licences are valid for three years and tree felling licences have a validity period of up to 10 years and may cover more than one felling operation.  For instance, a licensee may hold a tree felling licence to thin forestry in one year and then to clear fell the same are a few years later. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not possible to say with any certainty, the number of licences that must issue to achieve various targets.  However, based on last year&rsquo;s output, I expect that approx. 65% of all licence decisions to issue this year will be for tree felling, 20% for afforestation and the balance for forest roads.  The  Department has set a target of 4,500 forestry licences to issue this year.<\/p>  <p>  Coillte chooses to submit its tree felling licence requirement in batches, perhaps once or twice each year, with the intention of utilising the licences for their harvesting programme in a particular year.
