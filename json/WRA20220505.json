These are people who have a strong desire\u00a0and high propensity\u00a0to travel internationally and who are interested in our rich heritage\u00a0and culture. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, our living and historic culture sits at the heart of what is presented and communicated widely across Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s suite of global marketing communications. Tourism Ireland aims to ensure that visitors understand that they can easily marry opportunities to visit and appreciate our historic sites &ndash; pre-Christian, monastic, castles or stately homes &ndash; with active involvement in our vibrant living culture through festivals, music, literature, theatre and so on. A number of historic and iconic sites, including Trinity College and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, feature in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s global Green Button campaign in overseas markets.<\/p>  <p>  Festivals and events also play a significant part in attracting and holding visitors in particular areas of Ireland at different times of the year. Tourism Ireland works closely with many festivals to provide exposure for them in key markets overseas. The St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Galway 2020, Cork Jazz Festival, and Wexford Festival Opera are just some examples of festivals which have received extensive coverage through Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing overseas.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland also work with Culture Ireland to bring the best of Ireland&rsquo;s artists, writers, poets, musicians and dancers to the attention of enthusiasts and new audiences. <\/p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland's work in the Cultural Space celebrates James Joyce's &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo; which was first published as a complete novel on 2 February 1922. One hundred years later, Tourism Ireland is taking every opportunity to highlight Ulysses100 and Dublin&rsquo;s literary credentials in its promotional activity around the world. Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s aim is to encourage potential visitors to come and follow in the footsteps of Leopold Bloom, to explore Dublin and discover some of the city&rsquo;s cultural and architectural delights.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland also launched an exciting new giant-screen documentary film called 'Ireland' across the United States in February 2022. Narrated by Liam Neeson, 'Ireland' celebrates our rich history, culture, arts and music, as well as our spectacular scenery. The release of 'Ireland' has played a significant part in the recovery of tourism from the United States this year. 'Ireland' has been seen by millions of people across the United States &ndash; helping to inspire them to put the island of Ireland on their holiday wish-list for 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Irish Culture also features prominently throughout F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s domestic marketing communications. Taking the past year as an example, the promotion of culture and heritage sites was ongoing in the &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo; multi-channel national campaign. All 26 counties featured and had dedicated campaign assets that showcased their cultural attractions and experiences. Some examples include Knowth, Co. Meath; Birr Castle, Co. Offaly; Kylemore Abbey, Co. Galway; National Heritage Park, Wexford; and Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's 'Winter in Dublin' campaign which ran into the new year was created to promote a specially curated programme of cultural events and experiences taking place in the capital throughout the Winter.

All rents calculated are maximum rents, meaning landlords are free to charge the tenant less than this should they so wish.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Government's Housing for All strategy, 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026 by AHBs, Local Authorities and the LDA. AHBs will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund. The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The first 65 CREL-funded Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021 at least 40% below comparable open-market prices and range of other Cost Rental developments have been made available and tenanted in the period since then.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The First Home scheme will employ an equity stake model to support the purchase of c. 8,000 new homes on the private market in the years 2022 to 2025. The scheme will be jointly established and governed with participating mortgage lenders (primarily pillar retail banks). The overall anticipated spending for the scheme is &euro;400m, funded on a 50:50 basis by the State and participating mortgage lenders. The current schedule anticipates a launch of the First Home scheme website at the start of June, with a full scheme deployment and acceptance of applications from the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  Project Tosaigh was also announced through the Housing for All strategy. Under this initiative,\u00a0additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the LDA, who will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently in the process of finalising agreements with prospective proposers for the initial tranche of affordable homes delivered through this initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050500070#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050500071#WRE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050500071#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[22458\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050500071#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will seek the extension of the derogation originally introduced during the pandemic allowing AGMs\/EGMs of Owner Management Companies (OMCs) to be held online given the increased requirements for ongoing meetings of Owner Management Companies (OMCs) to facilitate higher levels of engagements between directors and owners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>The Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020 makes temporary amendments to the Companies Act 2014 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 to address issues arising as a result of Covid-19.  <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that the temporary provisions of the Act have been further extended to 31 December 2022 following Government approval on 26 April 2022.

However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills. \u00a0This policy fulfils our obligations under the Community Preference principles of membership of the EU. Under the Employment Permit Acts in order to work in the State all non-EEA nationals require a valid employment permit or relevant immigration permission from the Minister for Justice which allows them to reside and work in the State without the requirement for an Employment Permit. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce. \u00a0In order to meet this demand, the Government is committed to building and retaining a highly skilled workforce to serve the needs of the economy and has introduced a series of initiatives focused on workforce upskilling of new workforce entrants and those made redundant by the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended and are dependent on a job offer from an Irish registered Employer for an eligible occupation. \u00a0It should be noted that the State's employment permit system is ordered by the use of occupation lists which determine which employments are highly demanded and which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits at a point in time. \u00a0These lists are reviewed on a twice-yearly basis.<\/p>  <p>  To assist applicants when applying for an employment permit checklist documents have been prepared. \u00a0Notably, checklist documents have been specifically prepare to assistant applicants when applying for a General Employment Permit for the roles of Chef and Hospitality Manager and these, inter alia, are available on the Department's website through the following link -\u00a0Employment Permits Checklists - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in applications for employment permits over the course of 2021 and into 2022 which has impacted on processing times.\u00a0 From the start of January 2021 to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.\u00a0 Processing times were also impacted as a result of the HSE cyber-attack which had a direct effect on employment permit applications associated with the July 2021 Doctors rotation, which had to be processed manually. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recognises the impact delays in the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and significant resources have been allocated to processing times.

A local authority housing loan applicant, who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme, must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are a number of differences between the local authority MPI scheme and standard MPI products available on the market.\u00a0 Most notably, the current local authority MPI covers mortgage repayments in case of borrower disability, which is not part of standard MPI. In addition, the local authority MPI scheme offers a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme as opposed to standard MPI products that are individually priced based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the local authority scheme provides benefits not typically available under standard MPI products;<\/p>  <p>  - Mortgage repayments are paid if there is a valid claim as a result\u00a0of disability;<\/p>  <p>  - Separate to life cover, an additional &euro;3,000 is payable in the\u00a0event of a member&rsquo;s death<\/p>  <p>  - Members are covered for death up to age 75, where as standard MPI\u00a0cover usually ceases at the age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering in accordance with the terms of EU Directives relating to the award of public service contracts. This is to ensure that\u00a0the most appropriate cover at the best value for money is secured\u00a0for local authority borrowers\u00a0over the entire life of their mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent public procurement competition for the provision and administration of\u00a0this MPI scheme was conducted by the\u00a0Local Government Management Agency.\u00a0The contract resulting from this open tender competition\u00a0came into effect from 1 January 2022 and is due to expire on 31 December 2022. My Department will review the provision and administration of the MPI scheme prior to that date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050500073#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050500073#WRG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[21480\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050500073#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention was drawn to the fact that approved housing bodies are being bypassed in the mortgage to rent process in favour of a private operator.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme was introduced in 2012 for borrowers of commercial lending institutions and is targeted at those households in mortgage arrears who have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), who agree to the voluntary surrender of their home and who have very limited options, if any, to meet their long-term housing needs themselves.\u00a0In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support.\u00a0The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the MTR scheme, the borrower surrenders their property to their lender and it will be then sold to the MTR provider who is interested in the property. This can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. If more than one party is interested in buying the property, the lender will provide information to the borrower around the options available to them and the borrower will make the decision on who purchases the property. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the initial years of the scheme, the scheme relied solely on AHBs to purchase from lenders, properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by borrowers. A Review of the\u00a0MTR scheme\u00a0for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions was published in February 2017.\u00a0While there are obvious social and economic benefits to be derived from the MTR scheme, most significantly by facilitating individual households in mortgage arrears to remain in their home,\u00a0the 2017 Review acknowledged that consideration needed to be given to the capacity of AHBs to intensify their involvement in the MTR scheme given the ambitious targets for the AHB sector around delivering new social housing supply.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Review committed to exploring the potential of private institutional investment in MTR in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale.\u00a0The capital outlay to purchase these properties could be provided through private finance to avoid competing for upfront exchequer capital resources within the overall funding available for social housing.\u00a0An\u00a0Expressions of Interest\u00a0(EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) acted as financial advisor during the process, undertaking due diligence on the financial capacity of the proposers to commit to the long-term undertaking of the scheme. The outcome from the\u00a0EOI process was that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model\u00a0was announced\u00a0in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of a private entity, in addition to the existing AHBs who continue to be an integral part of the MTR scheme, gives opportunities to achieve greater scale and meet the long-term housing needs of a greater number of borrowers who have unsustainable mortgage arrears. This is evident through the increased number of completed cases since the private entity has entered into the scheme. In 2021, approximately 250% more cases were completed as part of the scheme than in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme.

Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.<\/p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance.

The PSI has been liaising with<b><\/b>stakeholders, including the IPU on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue. ?In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU.

Workforce challenges are being experienced\u00a0in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.\u00a0 However, robust data for Ireland is needed to be able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future.\u00a0 It will be on the basis of gathering and analysing this up-to-date, robust and relevant data, that recommendations can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs for a pharmacist workforce in the future, as Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.\u00a0\u00a0The European commission is currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project.
