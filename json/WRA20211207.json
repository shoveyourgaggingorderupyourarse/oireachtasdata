The Rural Development Programmes agreed by each Member State with the EU Commission were designed to correspond to specified Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programming periods.  The CAP programming periods in turn correspond to the EU's budgetary cycle.  The Rural Development Programme will now be replaced by each Member State&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the 2007 to 2013 CAP programming period, LEADER was included as a number of linked measures under Axis 4 of the RDP. The LEADER allocation for the 2007 to 2013 CAP programming period was almost &euro;400 million. This was subsequently revised in 2013, due to a downturn in the national economy, to &euro;377m on foot of the agreement by the EU Commission of a formal amendment to the 2007-2013 RDP.

Total expenditure to date, including expenditure of the deferred surrender, stands at &euro;329 million.

According to our sale of goods legislation, if the product received is not of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose or does not match the description given to the consumer, they have a right to certain remedies including repair, replacement or a refund. Section 53(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 states, that where a buyer deals as consumer and the seller refuses, or fails within a reasonable time, to remedy a breach of a condition implied into the sales contract by the Act, the buyer is entitled <i>&lsquo;to have the defect constituting the breach remedied elsewhere and to maintain an action against the seller for the costs thereby incurred by him&rsquo;.  <\/i>Under S.I. No. 11\/2003 - European Communities (Certain Aspects of the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees) Regulations 2003 products must be &lsquo;in conformity&rsquo; with the contract. To be in conformity, the products must meet specific conditions about quality. This is known as the legal guarantee. The legislation includes a reverse burden of proof so where a problem with a product arises within 6 months, it is presumed that it was there at the time of delivery and it is up to the trader to prove otherwise. After this period the consumer must prove that the problem existed at the time of delivery and must make their claim within 6 years of delivery.  <\/p><p>In addition to the legal guarantee, some traders also offer consumers other after-sales services in the form of commercial guarantees or warranties. These cover faults that arise with a product after use by the consumer for a specific period of time. Commercial guarantees are generally offered for free by a trader but often require the consumer to register and provide certain data to the trader in order to apply.  On the other-hand a warranty can be provided for a set fee and, like insurance, may cover things like accidental damage. <\/p><p>Because commercial guarantees and warranties are offered as an additional service to consumers, their terms and conditions can vary from trader to trader. However, they cannot contain unfair terms or seek to adversely affect a consumer's statutory rights.  If they do contain this sort of term, it will not be legally binding on the consumer. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (&quot;CCPC&quot;) recommends that consumers always check the terms and conditions of their guarantee or warranty to see if it will be affected by independent repairs. <\/p><p>If a trader refuses to honour a commercial guarantee or warranty, both are enforceable under contract law through the Courts (incl. the Small Claims procedure). Where a consumer has a query on their rights in relation to these agreements, or wants to make a complaint, they can contact the CCPC helpline for further information. The CCPC has also published some useful consumer advice on their website in relation to guarantees and warranties here:  <i>www.ccpc.ie\/consumers\/shopping\/buying-goods\/guarantees-and-warranties\/. <\/i><\/p><p>In terms of updating the law, the Consumer Rights Bill is currently being drafted by my Department and will further strengthen consumer rights in relation to both the legal (statutory) and commercial guarantees. Part 2 of the Bill will transpose the new Directive (EU) 2019\/771 on contracts for the sale of goods into Irish law. Under the Directive commercial guarantees are broadly defined as:-<\/p><p><i>&lsquo;any undertaking by the trader or a producer to the consumer, in addition to the trader&rsquo;s legal obligations relating to the guarantee of conformity, to reimburse the price paid or to replace, repair or service goods in any way if they do not meet the specifications or any other requirements not related to conformity set out in the guarantee statement or in relevant advertising&rsquo;<\/i>.  <\/p><p>In relation to independent repairs there will positive changes implemented by the Bill.  Under the legal guarantee, the Bill sets out detailed rules for the remedies of repair, replacement, price reduction and termination where there is a lack of conformity of the goods with the contract.  The Bill further states that the consumer can have any lack of conformity remedied elsewhere and recover all reasonable costs in doing so from the trader. <\/p><p>The Bill also includes more detailed provisions in relation to unfair contract terms which will apply to all consumer contracts, including commercial guarantees and warranties offered by traders to consumers.  It includes a blacklist of unfair terms as well as a list of contract terms presumed to be unfair.  This latter list includes <i>'A term which has the object or effect of preventing without a valid reason the consumer from obtaining repairs or spare parts from another trader.' <\/i>The Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill recently went through pre-legislative scrutiny and my officials have assured me that the Bill will be ready for publication in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[59806\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if the consultation process has commenced regarding the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021; and the associations and organisations that will be consulted.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>The Government has agreed to a timed amendment to the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021. <\/p><p>This will allow time, as I outlined on the floor of the D&aacute;il, to examine the issues carefully and to ensure that all stakeholders are consulted. <\/p><p>This process will commence as soon as possible and will involve engagement with organisations representing retired workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[59824\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 141 of 24 March 2021, the steps he plans to take to ensure that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission secures a copy of the report for the Irish owners who risk losing their family homes given that 12 owners have received demand letters from a solicitor (details supplied) on behalf of a bank which have been followed in five cases with European enforcement orders which under European Union legislation cannot be contested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>One of the primary functions of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (&lsquo;CCPC&rsquo;) is to enforce consumer protection law in Ireland. For cross border consumer protection issues, the CCPC is part of the European Consumer Protection Co-operation (CPC) Network, which is comprised of national authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders and allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues. I am advised by the CCPC that the CPC Network is central to addressing this matter, which involved the purchase of properties in France. These properties were developed, marketed, sold and managed by French traders under a French &lsquo;Residence de Tourisme&rsquo; scheme devised by the French Government to provide tourist accommodation in France. Under the European CPC network, the appropriate authorities to conduct an investigation in relation to this matter are the French consumer protection authorities &ndash; Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). <\/p>  <p>  The CCPC assures me that it has engaged with the DGCCRF with respect to the issues highlighted by Irish property purchasers of these French properties. The CCPC received complaints from Irish property purchasers and provided an initial preliminary assessment to the DGCCRF for over 150 complainants. Following consultation with the DGCCRF, the CCPC collated and transferred to the DGCCRF the transactional documentation of over 150 Irish complainants. The CCPC has and continues to provide significant time and resources to this matter and to supporting the DGCCRF investigation. In addition, throughout the period of engagement with the DGCCRF, whenever issues have been raised by complainants or where they have requested the CCPC to forward additional documentation to DGCCRF in relation to any matters, the CCPC has done so and acted in accordance with DGCCRF instructions to ensure compliance with French legal requirements regarding criminal investigations. <\/p>  <p>  The DGCCRF are investigating the issues that were referred to the CCPC by the complainants involved. The primary focus of the CCPC is to continue to support the DGCCRF investigation through providing any assistance or information requested by the DGCCRF. The CCPC has not yet received the final report of the DGCCRF investigation. The CCPC has kept lines of communication open with the complainants and has updated complainants when such updates have been provided by the DGCCRF. That will continue to be the case.  The DGCCRF have advised that they will inform the CCPC when reports are handed over to the Public Prosecutor in France and they will draw the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s attention to the importance of keeping Irish complainants informed about the state of play of proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  The CCPC further assures me that it has notified the DGCCRF of recent developments including the European Enforcement Orders that are referred to and the seriousness of these for the individuals involved.<\/p>  <p>  The CCPC considers this matter as a high priority issue and one to which considerable resources have been dedicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[59827\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he is giving consideration to the provisions of the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>The Government has agreed to a timed amendment to the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021. <\/p><p>This will allow time, as I outlined on the floor of the D&aacute;il, to examine the issues carefully and to ensure that all stakeholders are consulted. <\/p><p>I have given the matter careful consideration and to this end a consultation process will commence as soon as possible and will involve engagement with organisations representing retired workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[59828\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700068#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the supports that are available to SMEs such as in a company (details supplied) which has seen 28 birthday parties cancelled since Government comments regarding restricting birthday parties over the Christmas period due to Covid-19 numbers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19 the Government has worked to support businesses through a wide range of financial measures including the wage subsidy scheme, COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, commercial rates waivers and warehousing of tax liabilities.

The NBP roll out is currently a 7 year plan under the contract and deployment is due to be complete by the end of 2026.   Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with over 33,000 premises available to order and pre-order across 13 counties (Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow).

It has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels. New\/additional direct ferry links with increased capacity including to Cherbourg, Dunkerque, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Roscoff and Santander have come on stream and are seeing high demand. These responses and the new services launched over this and last year (see further below), demonstrate the commitment of the shipping companies to the Irish market.

The IMDO report notes that traffic to GB has declined significantly since January 2021; in Q3, RoRo traffic from ROI to GB fell by 20% compared to Q3 2019. In the first nine months of this 2021, ROI-GB traffic declined 25% compared to 2019.<\/p><p>In terms of RoRo capacity, Irish importer and exporters have benefitted from a significant increase in the choice of direct EU services in 2021.

The HGV driver shortage is a challenge here in Ireland and throughout Europe.  It is a multifaceted issue with a range of different contributing factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on the labour market for many sectors. <\/p><p>My Department established the National Logistics and Supply Chain<b><\/b>Skills Group in 2019, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sectors in Ireland.  The Group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all of the relevant Government Departments and Agencies. I have asked the Group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and to make recommendations, which I expect to receive shortly. <\/p><p>The promotion of education, training, careers and sustainable employment in the sector is crucial, along with skills development and career progression for existing workers.  My Department has engaged with the Department of Social Protection (DSP), which has dedicated employer relations teams offering a range of supports and services to employers to fill vacancies including recruitment campaigns, specialised jobs fairs and through the online portal JobsIreland.ie. <\/p><p>I understand that the DSP organises recruitment events in the EU\/EEA labour market for sectors where there are particularly acute labour shortages and that it will run a transport-focused event early in the new year.  My Department will engage with industry to promote the event.  <\/p><p>HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA must have a valid employment permit and a visa, if coming from a visa-required state as defined by the Department of Justice.  Following engagement with my colleague Minister of State English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA has been removed.  These drivers must also exchange their HGV driver licences for an Irish licence.  Ireland has licence exchange agreements with several countries and the Road Safety Authority, which oversees these agreements, is engaging with a number of other countries with a view to progressing further licence exchange agreements. <\/p><p>Regarding driver testing in Ireland, in the 4 weeks prior to December 1st, an average of 153 tests for HGV drivers were carried out by RSA testers each week, with a pass rate of almost 75%. This means that 114 HGV drivers were qualified on average each week.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector. The Government&rsquo;s aim is to develop a strategy that will focus on generating efficiencies and improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  I remain mindful of the driver and skills shortage facing the sector, and a section of the Haulage Strategy will focus on this. <\/p><p>Minister Ryan and I will continue to proactively engage with the freight transport, distribution and logistics sectors and the Government remains committed to continuing to support the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[60090\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of qualified HGV drivers there are currently in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":347,"content":"<p>I will ask my officials to provide the information to the Deputy when is it obtained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[60091\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG02900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of HGV driving licences that were issued in Ireland in each of the years from 2015 to 2020 and to date in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>I will ask my officials to provide the information to the Deputy when is it obtained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[60129\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the nature of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the International Civil Aviation Organization in relation to reduction in international civil aviation emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>The Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention) adopted in 1944, established a framework of rules and best practice for the operation of civil aviation internationally, It also established the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating and regulating international air transport. Ireland is a signatory to the Chicago Convention and the Convention was given effect in domestic law through the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to reducing international civil aviation emissions, Annex 16 of the convention deals with Environmental Protection. The Council of ICAO develops Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for implementation by the signatory States. Whilst SARPs are not mandatory, their development usually leads to changes in domestic, or in Ireland&rsquo;s case, EU law which is then enacted in national legislation. ICAO&rsquo;s sustainability strategy includes four main pillars including aircraft technology improvements, operational improvements, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and market-based measures (CORSIA).  EU policy is broadly derived from this basket of measures.<\/p>  <p>  EU Member States coordinate positions around the development of policy at ICAO level. In practice this entails the adoption of common EU positions at the ICAO Council and the Triennial Assembly. Some of the recent EU Fit for 55 proposals such as the ReFuelEU Initiative, which aims to increase the use of SAFs across the Union, and the Revision of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for Aviation Directive which will incorporate CORSIA (ICAO&rsquo;s global emission reduction and offsetting scheme) and the EU&rsquo;s Emission Trading System (ETS) are reflective of the EU&rsquo;s interpretation of the ICAO Basket of Measures. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, along with all other EU Member States, has opted to participate in CORSIA from the pilot phase beginning in 2021. This process involves reporting emissions data and offsetting requirements for Irish airlines directly to ICAO by the Department of Transport through an online system known as the CORSIA Central Registry (CCR). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for CORSIA data collection from airlines and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has responsibility for much of the technical environmental reporting to ICAO. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst Ireland for the most part develops its policy response to ICAO with EU partners, it is also a member of ABIS, the joint representation to ICAO of Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland. ABIS experts contribute to much of the work undertaken by ICAO panels, committees and study groups. Currently the Netherland holds the ABIS chair and the ABIS representative is a member of ICAO&rsquo;s Council and participates in the Climate and Environment Committee (CEC) of the Council.<\/p>  <p>  ICAO contracting states are invited to submit a State Action for Aviation Emissions Reduction every two years. Ireland last submitted this plan in 2019 and will submit the latest iteration by year&rsquo;s end. Again, much of this plan comprises common measures that are taken at EU level. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comhartha&iacute; B&oacute;thair","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG03325"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[60177\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700070#WRG03350","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"cur s&iacute;os a dh&eacute;anamh ar an sc&eacute;im ph&iacute;ol&oacute;tach do sh&iacute;neacha tr&aacute;chta curtha ar bun c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin ag an Roinn maidir le feice&aacute;lacht na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn, mar a thagair an tAire St&aacute;it Gaeltachta d&oacute; le linn na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2019 sa Seanad le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, agus c&eacute;n f&aacute;th n&aacute;r leanadh leis an sc&eacute;im sin.

Exemptions from VAT for certain activities in the public interest are set out in Chapter 2 of Title IX of the Directive.

Paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 1 provides for an exemption in respect of the supply of professional dental services. <\/p>  <p>  The exemption from VAT in respect of dental services is not dependent on the legal form of the taxable person supplying the service. It is the nature of the service that informs the VAT treatment. The legislation which transposes Article 132 of the Directive, and Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of the legislation, ensures that the exemption from VAT to the supply of dental services is applied consistently and in a manner which is not dependent on the legal form of the person supplying the service. In accordance with the Directive and CJEU jurisprudence the VAT exemption applies to dental services provided by a clinic, a principal dentist, or by an associate dentist, where those services are provided to a patient.<\/p>  <p>  Where a principal dentist receives consideration in respect of fee sharing arrangements and the nature of services consists of the supply of facilities for the carrying on of a dental practice, Revenue views this as a taxable supply of services within the scope of VAT. The final consumer in this fee sharing arrangement is not a patient availing of a supply of dental services to which the exemption applies. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has been clear at all times regarding the VAT treatment of dental fee sharing arrangements and has outlined its position in correspondence and meetings with the Irish Dental Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700071#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700071#WRH00900"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[60382\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700071#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) in relation to primary medical certificates for those severely affected by polio; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within the wider review that was commenced in March 2020 under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister O&rsquo;Gorman has confirmed that he has asked his officials to reconvene the working group established to carry out that review at the earliest opportunity and we are both agreed that this is the most appropriate forum for the review. With this in mind, my officials will work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer.

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  <\/p><p>In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (2<sup>nd<\/sup>December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.5 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.684 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;893 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 694,600 employees.  <\/p><p>It is estimated that almost &euro;1.5 billion in EWSS subsidy payments has been paid to the hospitality sector since the introduction of the scheme. Broadly, that is the largest share of payments to any sector and accounts for approximately 26% of all payments made to date. <\/p><p>The consistent approach of Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support under this scheme.At the same time, we have been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial cost to the Exchequer.  It is also worth noting that, within the scheme, more than half of those that benefit from EWSS are in sectors outside of the hospitality sector and would not be impacted by the latest public health measures.  <\/p><p>Last Friday, the Government decided that a targeted support in response to the further public health restrictions imposed on the  hospitality sector would be introduced.  The Deputies will be aware of the associated announcements that have been made.This targeted scheme will be modelled on the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) which operated effectively in the earlier phases of the pandemic when businesses were most heavily impacted by public health restrictions. The scheme will provide targeted and timely support to the hospitality sector to supplement the support they are receiving under the EWSS.Work is continuing at present to finalise all the various elements of this more focussed support measure which it is proposed will be paid weekly in arrears.  <\/p><p>In the circumstances, the EWSS as an economy wide scheme will continue on the path laid out for it on Budget day with the necessary legislation for this currently being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.

Where the issue relates to outstanding information or documentation, Revenue will clear the vehicle as quickly as possible once the necessary information or documentation is provided by the vehicle importer.

This sets out the process by which a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; of the Department can make a protected disclosure, what will happen when a disclosure is made and what the Department will do to protect the discloser.<\/p><p>The process supports the Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensuring that the culture and working environment of the Department encourage, facilitate and support any member of staff of the Department in &lsquo;speaking up&rsquo; on any issue that may impact adversely on the Department&rsquo;s ability to properly and fully carry out all its roles and responsibilities to the high performance standard required. Two alternative confidential recipients have been nominated to receive protected disclosures from internal staff, in the event that a staff member does not wish to make the disclosure to their line manager or the normal senior management team. These nominees are the Head of Legal and the Compliance Officer. To date, neither of these officers have received such an internal protected disclosure.<\/p><p>Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures Act requires the publication of a report in respect of protected disclosures received in the preceding year setting out certain information in respect of protected disclosures received. For the purposes of complying with section 22, the Department publishes information regarding protected disclosures formally identified as such, without identifying the person making the disclosure.  Previous reports indicate that one protected disclosure was received in 2018, one in 2019, and no protected disclosure received during 2020.  <\/p><p>Tabular summary: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>No. of Protected Disclosures <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>nil <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700071#WRH02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Enterprise Sector","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700071#WRH03000"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[59936\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700071#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the level of funding to be provided by his Department in 2022 for the promotion and support of the social enterprise sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department has no record of any funding being allocated for the promotion and support of the social enterprise sector in 2022.

It is understood that the consultants have completed their feasibility assessment report and have provided their conclusions and recommendations on the matter to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for its consideration as to the next steps to be taken to mitigate the risk of flooding in the area.<\/p>  <p>  Kilcoole was designated as an area of potentially significant flood risk through the national Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment, and the flood risk in the area was then assessed through the OPW&rsquo;s National Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study, with potential flood risk reduction and protection measures investigated. The CFRAM Study did not identify an economically viable flood protection measure for Kilcoole. However, it was decided that more detailed examination was warranted, and that a further assessment (referred to as the Scheme Viability Reviews, or &lsquo;SVR&rsquo;) should be undertaken to review the costs and benefits to determine if there would be sufficient confidence to take a proposed measure forward to detailed development and design.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to the work commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, consultants were appointed by the OPW to undertake the SVR for Kilcoole and for the neighbouring community of Newcastle, and options for flood protection have been reviewed for each community individually, and also as a joint scheme for both communities. The results of the review indicate that potential permanent technical solutions are not cost effective.  However, the OPW is planning to further assess the benefit to cost ratio of the potential technical solutions to reflect foreseen changes to the project appraisal process identified through a review of the approaches to project appraisal undertaken by the OPW in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Wicklow County Council has not applied to the OPW for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for works in the area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700071#WRH06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700072#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[60301\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700072#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the general scheme of the protected disclosures (amendment) Bill; if the transposition date is still expected to be 17 December 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>Directive (EU) 2019\/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (\"the Whistleblowing Directive\") was adopted in October 2019 and the deadline for transposition into Irish law is 17 December 2021.

Transposition of the Directive will require amendments to the 2014 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The draft general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the transposition of the Directive was published in May and referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach for pre-legislative scrutiny.

Once the report is published, I will consider its recommendations and finalise the Bill so I can bring it to Government for consideration and approval if in order.<\/p>  <p>  Taking into account that the pre-legislative process has yet to conclude as well as the timelines involved in bringing a Bill to Government for approval, as set out in the Cabinet Handbook, the legislation will not be published until early in the New Year. This means that Ireland will miss the deadline for transposition of 17 December. While Ireland is far from being the only Member State to find itself in this position, I very much regret this delay. It is essential, however, that legislation of such importance as this is done right as the consequences for whistleblowers when legislation intended to protect them fails to work as expected can be devastating. I expect the Bill to be enacted in the first quarter of next year. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside this, my department is preparing measures to assist with the transposition including updates to the Statutory Guidance. This will also include ensuring there is interim guidance available for both the public and private sector when the whistleblowing Directive comes into effect on 17 December.

My Department and PAS play a key role in driving the annual intakes of work placements across the Civil Service. To date over 230 placements have been made across 33 Departments\/Offices. Over 80% of WAM graduates have subsequently secured longer-term employment upon completion of their WAM programme.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) programme is an applied learning, development and socialisation programme for adults with an intellectual disability that was launched as a pilot programme in September 2018. It is facilitated by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in collaboration with two sponsor organisations, KARE and WALK. The goal of the Programme is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience, as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period. Over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure permanent Civil Service employment through confined competitions.<\/p><p>In terms of civil servants based in my own Department, the HR Strategy Unit developed the <i>People@PER HR Strategy<\/i>that has a focus on embracing and embedding a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department through diversity initiatives and training. This has included the establishment of a vibrant cross-divisional and cross-grade Diversity and Inclusion staff forum. My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who supports new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability and raises awareness about disability. New hires receive the <i>Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service<\/i>, a welcome letter from the Department&rsquo;s DLO and FAQs on Disability prepared by the National Disability Authority.

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1 billion. <\/p>  <p>  On 30 November 2020, Minister Martin and I announced that a new 2020 round of the Programme was opening with at least &euro;40 million available to allocate. The original closing date for applications was 12 February 2021 but in view of difficulties some applicants were encountering as a result of Covid restrictions, this deadline was extended until 1 March 2021.  By this closing date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.<\/p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed in accordance with these procedures. <\/p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021. The letter of provisional allocation encouraged all grantees to draw down this funding before year-end if possible and in recent weeks my Department has been prioritising the payments of all existing grants. Ensuring that as many older grants as possible are paid before year-end will maximise the funding available to allocate for the 2020 capital SCEP applications.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to these 2020 capital SCEP applications, assessment work is continuing. No decision has been made to defer the allocations but given the record number of applications received, it is expected that this work will not now be completed and allocations made until early in the new year.  Due to the nature of the SCEP programme, it can often take applicants a number of years to fully draw down their grants so the deferral of the announcement of allocations to the new year will not have significant implications for the total funding available to award.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the funding available to allocate, at least &euro;34,535m has currently been provided for the SCEP in 2022.  This represents an increase of &euro;6.6m on the 2021 allocation. Furthermore I am in ongoing discussions with my colleague, Michael McGrath, T.D., the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to possible additional resources for the Programme.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.<\/p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational\/community\/religious buildings. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft Request for Tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final Request for Tender documentation. My Department intends to publish the call for tender shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department has advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside a draft of the interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence in December. A copy of the draft interim regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period.

This High Ambition Coalition is an intergovernmental group of 70 countries co-chaired by Costa Rica and France, championing a global deal for nature and people with the central goal of protecting at least 30 percent of the world&rsquo;s land and ocean by 2030. The '30x30' target is a global target which aims to halt the accelerating loss of species, and protect vital ecosystems that are the source of our economic security.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, launched in May 2020, contains ambitious and far-reaching actions and targets for nature, including a key commitment to legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU&rsquo;s land area and 30% of the EU&rsquo;s sea area by 2030 and integrate ecological corridors, as part of a Trans-European Nature Network.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, I welcome the motion passed at the IUCN Congress in September. It aligns the IUCN's position in this matter with that of the HAC and the position of the EU and its Member States, including Ireland, as set out in the Biodiversity Strategy 2030, in the run up to CBD COP15 next April. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700073#WRK02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Industry","counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700073#WRK02300"},{"type":"question","counter":546,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[60014\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700073#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the action his Department can take in cases in which local authorities fail to protect the health of residents living adjacent to large construction sites in which such sites are clearly in breach of planning conditions leading to unacceptable levels of noise, vibration and dust.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":547,"content":"<p>Section 34(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), provides for the attaching of a range of conditions to planning permissions by planning authorities as may be deemed necessary, including in relation to the following:  <\/p>  <p>  - the emission of any noise or vibration from any structure or site comprised in the development authorised by the permission which might give reasonable cause for annoyance either to persons in any premises in the neighbourhood of the development or to persons lawfully using any public place in that neighbourhood, or <\/p>  <p>  - the intrusion of any noise or vibration which might give reasonable cause for annoyance to any person lawfully occupying any such structure or site; <\/p>  <p>  The attaching of conditions to planning permissions is a matter that is determined locally by the relevant planning authority on a case by case basis. <\/p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, enforcement of unauthorised development is a matter for the relevant planning authority, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met.

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2020, I announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m.

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. <\/p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland, through the designation by the Minister of Cost Rental dwellings. This new form of rental tenure will see rents linked to the cost of provision of homes, rather than being subject to the pressures of the open market. Rents will therefore only increase in line with consumer inflation, remaining stable in real terms, while continuing to cover management and maintenance costs. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), to deliver initial Cost Rental projects. In building to this scale and with a targetted average of 2,000 Cost Rental Units per year, the State will provide certain focused funding supports, to help delivery partners to provide rental homes that target affordable rents, at levels in the order of 25% below market rents.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;35 million to the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme which enabled the first Cost Rental homes to be delivered this year by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. The tenanting processes for further Cost Rental homes at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Barnhall, Leixlip, County Kildare, are currently underway. In total, 390 Cost Rental units will be delivered through CREL funding, with the initial focus being in the Greater Dublin Area and Cork.  I can confirm that homes delivered under Phase 1 CREL funding will range in sizes from those suitable to smaller households to larger family homes and will include 86 one-bedroom residences.  A further &euro;75 million will be allocated in 2022 to help meet the Housing for All target of a further 750 Cost Rental homes, including one bedroomed units.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has directed Cost Rental landlords to seek the efficient use of resources by allocating appropriately sized homes according to household needs. This direction is to ensure that landlords place tenants into homes of an appropriate size, in order to maximise the efficient use of the limited number of properties that have been available during the initial rollout of Cost Rental. Over the period of the Housing for All plan from 2021 to 2030, it is intended that 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered in our urban centres by Local Authorities, AHBs and the LDA. These Cost Rental homes will accommodate a range of different household types and sizes, including individuals living alone or in smaller households, as further developments are completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700073#WRK05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700073#WRK05800"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[60510\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700073#WRK05900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his Department has had engagement in relation to the repair of a weir (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1514","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>Funding maintenance and repair of weirs is not a matter that falls within the remit of my Department, which has no specific funding line for such projects. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, in view of the strategic importance of this project from an economic, social and environmental perspective, a once off allocation of &euro;175,000 from the Local Government Fund was approved in 2019 so that initial works could get underway.

In that discussion, I outlined Ireland and the EU's position on the treatment of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang.

We have made clear that it needs to be a citizen-led process, with the greatest weight attached to the views of ordinary citizens rather than that of Member States or institutions such as the European Parliament or European Commission. This approach has informed our national programme in Ireland, led by my colleague, Minister of State Thomas Byrne, which has involved extensive outreach to community groups and sectors, particularly those whose voice is seldom heard on issues related to Europe.<\/p>  <p>  This approach is one which is also shared by a large number of Member States who, along with Ireland, consistently argue within the Council for a policy-first, citizen-led discussion within the Conference.<\/p>  <p>  Minister Byrne and I will continue to work to encourage as many voices as possible within Ireland, including EU citizens living in Northern Ireland, to have their say in relation to the Future of Europe within the Conference framework. A number of Citizens' Panels, comprising 800 citizens randomly selected across Europe, are currently meeting and their deliberations and recommendations will be accorded particular weight when the final report on the Conference is prepared by its Plenary and submitted to the Conference Executive Board next year. Sixteen Irish citizens are participating within the four Panels, one of which is scheduled to hold its final decisive session in Dublin in early February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700074#WRL03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700074#WRL03900"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[60346\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700074#WRL04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on matters following his recent visit to Palestine (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":638,"content":"<p>The situation in relation to the question posed is as set out in my reply to PQ no. 56374\/21 and in my statement to the D&aacute;il on the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory on 30 November. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700074#WRL04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700074#WRL04200"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[60348\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700074#WRL04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the revenue generated on a daily basis by the appointment service fee for urgent passport appointments since it was launched on 27 September 2021 to date; the revenue for same-day turnround and four to five-day turnaround applications; the number of applications processed through this facility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>The Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and in Cork offer an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports.

The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.<\/p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.<\/p>  <p>  A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie.

They are underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour and the need for such incidents to be recorded.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines when issued will apply to all schools.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p>  <p>  Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) play a huge role in helping to ensure the inclusion of pupils with significant care needs in education and in school life.  This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  A core recommendation of the NCSE review concerned a change in the way that SNAs are allocated to mainstream classes in both primary and post primary schools and called for the greater proportion of SNAs in these classes to be allocated on the basis of an educational profile of each school before the commencement of the school year in a similar manner to the allocation of special education teachers (SETs).<\/p>  <p>  The new frontloaded model for allocating SNA posts is intended to ensure that SNA support is available immediately to students upon their arrival, reducing delays in accessing support. It eliminates the need for individual applications and professional assessments in order to access resources and facilitates schools allocating the available resources to those with greatest need.<\/p>  <p>  Frontloading SNA support eliminates the need for an individual assessment for each student, ending the link with the requirement for a formal diagnosis to gain access to support, and will reduce the delays in making supports available to schools. <\/p>  <p>  This would enable a school to allocate SNA support to a pupils without a formal diagnosed special educational but need who need support. <\/p>  <p>  The frontloaded model when implemented will also improve job security for SNAs in schools ensuring greater certainty for SNAs in relation to their employment status as the school allocation of SNA support will not be based on an annual application process. <\/p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020\/21 school year.  However, in light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools has been deferred to the beginning of the 2022\/23 school year. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  The trade union's claim in relation to raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. <\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36\/2020 and 51\/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications have impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since the minimum qualifications were set, the Department has indicated to the trade union that it is open to reviewing the position. The Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700075#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700075#WRM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[59842\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700075#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the submission of a planning application for the permanent build for a school (details supplied); if there are delays to this process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>The project referred to by the Deputy is in the early architectural planning stage which involves site surveys, school design stages and the preparation of Planning Permission.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the conditions of sale, the lodgement of planning permission is under the remit of the vendor.

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen.<\/p>  <p>  Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behaviour must be proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla's Educational Welfare Service has published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.<\/p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.<\/p>  <p>  A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour.  <\/p>  <p>  Further to the receipt of policy advice from the NCSE, the Department of Education established an Expert Working Group to develop guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of challenging behaviours (including the use of physical interventions) where such behaviour is considered as likely to present serious risk of physical harm to the student concerned and\/or others within the school environment.<\/p>  <p>  Development of the Guidelines has been informed by evidence showing that whole school positive behavioural approaches and early and ongoing engagement with the school community, including parents\/guardians, are necessary for the development of effective school policy and practice.<\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of the views and contributions received as part of the consultation process, a final draft of the guidelines has been prepared and is being considered by the Department.  They place a strong focus on prevention and early intervention strategies for the management of crisis student behaviour in which physical intervention may be employed only as the last part of a comprehensive, positive and planned behavioural approach by the school. They are underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour and the need for such incidents to be recorded.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines when issued will apply to all schools. In this regard, consideration is being given to the implementation of guidelines by schools including the kind of supports and training that may be required.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700075#WRM06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[59950\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700076#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps that can be taken in relation to the case of a child (details supplied) who is seeking a place in an ASD unit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government<\/p><p>The State currently spends in excess of 25% of its annual education and training budget (&euro;9.2 Billion) on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>This includes funding for a wide range of schemes and supports including special classes, special school places, SNAs and teachers. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.

The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. <\/p>  <p>  In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. <\/p>  <p>  A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department. Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant  assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group also notes the potential use for air cleaners &ldquo;consider using stand-alone high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter devices to further reduce airborne virus in poorly ventilated spaces&rdquo; The Departments Guidance is clear that where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room\/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in   conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. This is   line with Expert Group guidance which identifies that in areas with poor ventilation that structural interventions and measures to increase natural   ventilation should be completed. Where such structural interventions or measures are not possible in the short term, that consideration should be   given to using stand-alone HEPA filter devices in poorly ventilated spaces pending the completion of structural interventions.<\/p>  <p>  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.<\/p>  <p>  The requirement for air cleaners in schools will depend on advices provided  to schools by their Architect\/Engineer.  As part of contingency planning, the Department has put arrangements in place for a small reserve of air cleaners to facilitate quick deployment to any primary or post-primary school which has an immediate need and has been unsuccessful in sourcing locally. To date the Department has received two queries regarding ventilation from schools in Cork. The Department provided technical advice to each school on how best to manage ventilation in accordance with the published guidance.  A HEPA filter was not considered necessary in either case. <\/p>  <p>   The Department's approach on good ventilation in schools, as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus, is fully consistent with Public Health advice and  the Expert Group recommendations on good practices, the use of portable CO2 monitors and the targeted deployment of  HEPA air filter devices where necessary for poorly ventilated areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700076#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Administration","counter":739,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700076#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":740,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[60036\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700076#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps schools must take in cases in which multiple teachers are absent on the same day; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":741,"content":"<p>My Department has recently implemented a range of measures to address supply of substitute teacher in schools, including  a significant increase in teachers on the primary school supply panels, facilitating post primary teachers to work additional hours, postponing  CPD for teachers (other than planned CPD for post primary teachers relating to reforms in Senior Cycle examinable subjects) and, with the cooperation of the HEIs and the Teaching Council, supporting the availability of student teachers to undertake substitute work.<\/p><p>Information on these and other measures has been communicated to schools in  Circular 50\/2021 COVID-19 (<i>Operational Supports for primary schools for 2021\/2022<\/i>), Information Note SD 0001\/2021  (<i>Further supplementary measures to increase the availability of substitute teachers for recognised primary schools &ndash; 2021\/2022 school year<\/i>) and Information Note SD 0002\/2021 (<i>Measures to increase the availability of substitutes for post primary schools for 2021\/2022<\/i>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700076#WRN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":743,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[60037\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700076#WRN02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will seek public health communicators to relay public health information on behalf of schools rather than relying on principals.","asker":"1514","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":744,"content":"<p>The Department of Education has worked collaboratively with the Department of Health and the HSE  to support the delivery of important public health messages to school communities &ndash; students, staff and parents.

Public Health advice remains that asymptomatic children are at low risk for transmission. Schools are controlled settings and the approach to contact tracing is risk-based in relation to the setting, age-group and the existence of other preventive measures. Public Health doctors have advised that the on the ground experience has been and remains that schools are relatively low risk environments and have not been a driver of transmission in children over the course of the pandemic.  The house-hold setting is the highest risk for transmission. <\/p><p>Unvaccinated people of all ages who are household contacts of a case must restrict movements (and stay out of work or school) for 10 days and have a PCR test at day 0 and day 10. As of the 27th September 2021, a decision was taken by Government in line with recommendations from NPHET to cease routine contact tracing of asymptomatic close contacts in children older than 3 months to under 13 years outside of the household setting, including those attending primary educational and childcare settings. <\/p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education has introduced a programme in which antigen tests are being made available to children in primary schools.  <\/p><p>Parents and Guardians of a primary school child, who is a confirmed case of COVID-19 following a PCR test, are asked to inform their school&rsquo;s principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. No personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home. Tests can be ordered from a helpline operated by the HSE. <\/p><p>It is important that parents inform principals quickly if a child receives a PCR &lsquo;detected&rsquo; test for Covid-19. By doing this, the choice to participate in antigen testing can be offered to other parents quickly. It is important that everyone continues to follow all the public health advice in using this programme. It is not mandatory for children to participate in antigen testing. Asymptomatic children who are in a pod where a child has tested positive for Covid-19 can continue to attend school, whether they participate in antigen testing or not. Information materials for parents and principals was shared with schools and publicised directly to parents. <\/p><p>Parents should not be using antigen testing as a green light test if their children have symptoms.

The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.   <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. My Department is currently commencing a review of the Department&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools.  This review will take account of developments and relevant research, since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013. The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.   The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  This Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. <\/p><p>In March of last year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. <\/p><p>The rate of payment of this enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  This enhanced benefit is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  <\/p><p>The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies them as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and hence to avoid extreme pressure on the health system. <\/p><p>In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type and who are covered by Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions.  Illness Benefit is payable for up to two years, depending on satisfying the eligibility conditions.  Additional payments may be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children. <\/p><p>Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.

Applicants assessed with a yearly average of 48 or over continued to qualify for the maximum rate of State pension (contributory).  On this basis, according to the records of my Department there were 103,300 applicants who reached pension age between 1 September 2012 and 29 March 2018 whose rate of pension entitlement was not affected by the September 2012 rate band changes.<\/p><p>A carer&rsquo;s credit is awarded, whereas an earned credit is earned.  The State pension system gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role, through the award of credits and\/or the application of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (in the Yearly Average method for pension rate calculation) and\/or the application of HomeCaring Periods (in the Aggregated Contribution Method of pension calculation).  <\/p><p>PRSI credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.<\/p><p>The Homemakers Scheme was introduced with effect from 6 April 1994 to help homemakers and carers qualify for State pension (contributory).  This scheme is applied as part of the yearly average calculation to those with eligibility from that date (unlike HomeCaring Periods in the recently-introduced Aggregated Contributions Method).  The Homemakers&rsquo; Scheme allows up to 20 years (since 6 April 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age or for an incapacitated person(s) to be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions and credits, and for homemaker credits to be awarded for homemaking periods of less than a full contribution year.<\/p><p>HomeCaring Periods are included in the Aggregated Contributions Method, also known as the interim Total Contributions Approach, introduced by Government in 2018.  This scheme makes it easier for a home carer to qualify for a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory).

HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution.<\/p><p>For the Aggregated Contributions Method, an applicant&rsquo;s record is taken to mean the aggregate of paid contributions, credited contributions and HomeCaring Periods.  There is a cap of 1,040 on the combined amount of HomeCaring Periods and credited contributions that can be used in calculating pension entitlement.

These include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant.  Through these schemes over 135,000 carers are supported by regular income payments.  Spending in 2021 on these payments is expected to be approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system, one of which is the general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  People qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment for which they are eligible.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  In 2007 a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was introduced for certain people with another social welfare entitlement.  Under these arrangements, people in receipt of certain social welfare payments (other than Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit) who are providing full-time care and attention can retain their main payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which is equivalent to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  Therefore, a person who has an entitlement to another social welfare payment, (for example Widow&rsquo;s Pension) can retain that payment and continue to receive up to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  These arrangements apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances.  Recipients of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit are not eligible given the job seeking nature of these payments.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that payment of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is not dependent on means or social insurance contributions.  This grant is paid automatically to people getting Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (both at full rate and half-rate), Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Where an individual is not getting one of these payments, they can still qualify for the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant, providing they meet the qualifying criteria including the provision of full-time care and attention.  In recognition of the vital role that carers provide in our society, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant by &euro;150 as part of Budget 2021.  The current new rate of &euro;1,850 is the highest ever rate at which it has been paid since its introduction.  Spending on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is estimated to cost over &euro;265 million in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  However, to pay full-rate Carer's Allowance along with another social welfare payment, as suggested, would involve a very significant step away from the 'one person, one payment' approach outlined earler, would involve  significant additional expenditure and could only be considered in an overall Budgetary context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700078#WRP05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":905,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700078#WRP05800"},{"type":"question","counter":906,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[60172\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700078#WRP05900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the current status of a pandemic unemployment payment claim in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":907,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is available for employees and self-employed people who have lost employment and satisfy the scheme's statutory conditions.

This has been acknowledged by many stakeholders, groups and individual customers, including both the IPU and An Post during my recent meetings with them. <\/p>  <p>  When the Government had to introduce public health restrictions in 2020, all those in receipt of Jobseeker payments were given the option of being paid by EFT.  Only where jobseekers requested a change of payment method was their payment changed from the post office to EFT.  My Department did not recommend a change of payment method nor actively promote such a change among Jobseekers.  The process was driven by customer choice. <\/p>  <p>  This change in payment method also reflects a wider societal shift away from cash and is reflective of a natural year-on-year reduction of post office payments on all Departmental schemes.  It should also be noted that one in every five Jobseeker payments were paid via EFT prior to the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  As the country emerges from the worst of the pandemic and PUP scheme recipients are gradually migrating over to Jobseekers&rsquo; payments, my officials are reviewing the Department&rsquo;s payment policy.  <\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that a balance needs to be struck between the requirement to ensure that appropriate financial controls are in place while also considering the views of Social Welfare customers regarding their payment method choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700079#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","counter":959,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700079#WRQ04600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":958,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700079#WRQ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":959,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[59866\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700079#WRQ04600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if special provision is being made to support those forced into absences from work due to caring for children contracting Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":960,"content":"<p>My Department provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability.  It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  This Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In March of last year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of this enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  This enhanced benefit is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  <\/p>  <p>  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies them as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and hence to avoid extreme pressure on the health system. <\/p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type and who are covered by Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions.  Illness Benefit is payable for up to two years, depending on satisfying the eligibility conditions.  Additional payments may be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.     <\/p>  <p>  My Department keeps the range of income supports under review in order to make sure they meet their objectives.

This includes a &euro;2.7 million increase in core services, bringing core service provision to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, Tusla's allocation has increased by an additional &euro;41 million. I have directed Tusla to use part of these additional resources to maintain supports for DSGBV services and address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review of refuge provision.<\/p>  <p>  I have issued my Performance Statement to Tusla outlining the overall parameters of Tusla's financial resources, and signalling my priorities for the coming year. In response to this, Tusla will prepare its annual Business Plan for 2022 in accordance with section 46 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.

A new funding model will be a key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State.<\/p><p>An Expert Group was established in September 2019 to develop a new funding model for the sector. The Group was tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.<\/p><p>The Expert Group have met 21 times since late 2019. They have presented their report to me, and the report will be published on 7 December, following consideration by Government.<\/p><p>I have met with the Chair of the Group and I was briefed on its progress, which allowed for the emerging recommendations of the Expert Group to significantly inform the developments being introduced in Budget 2022.<\/p><p>Material relating to the work of the Expert Group, including reports from consultation and engagement, meeting documentation and research papers are available on a dedicated website, www.first5fundingmodel.ie.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 introduced a ground-breaking package of measures for the early learning and childcare sector &ndash; designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff. An additional &euro;78m in Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) brings the total investment in the sector to &euro;716m next year.<\/p><p>Currently, significant additional investment is being made in the sector through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which will remain available to the sector until April 2022, with a continued exemption to the turnover rule for employers in the sector. The scheme is also available to providers offering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. A one-off transition fund of up to &euro;37m will operate from May to August 2022, to support providers in the period leading up to the new Core Funding stream.<\/p><p>The Transition Fund will be open to all registered early learning and childcare providers, including ECCE-only providers, who sign up to the contract.<\/p><p>From September 2022, a major new Core Funding stream will be introduced. This core funding stream will be worth &euro;69m to providers in 2022 and &euro;207.3m in a full year from 2023 on. Under Core Funding, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase. The commitment not to increase fees will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the ECCE programme and National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are felt by parents.<\/p><p>The Core Funding will support providers to attract and retain staff, including degree-qualified staff and will support the Programme for Government commitment to support the drawing up of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) between employer and employee representatives to determine minimum rates of pay for workers, as well as terms and conditions of employment.<\/p><p>In terms of staffing, I am aware that many early learning and care and childcare services are reporting difficulties, exacerbated by the current high rate of Covid-19 in the community. My Department is actively monitoring the issue and has sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives.<\/p><p>My Department recently convened a Sub-Group of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum to discuss immediate staffing pressures resulting from Covid-19 and additional measures that may be needed. The Group is examining ways to provide additional staffing support on a temporary basis, including a proposal (that is also being considered by Further and Higher Education institutions) to build on the current process available to enable students who are undertaking Early Learning and Care qualifications to work in the sector temporarily while carrying on their studies. The Group has met on two occasions to date and is meeting again on 10 December to consider proposals. <\/p><p>While Covid-19 creates additional pressure, longer-term challenges with recruitment and retention of staff remain. The high level of staff turnover in the sector (18% in 2020) primarily reflects the level of pay and conditions of employment.  However, we should remember that the sector has continued to grow in recent years, despite the challenges.  Employment in the sector has risen from 25,700 in 2016 to 30,900 last year. Thanks to considerable supports from the Government over the last eighteen months, employee numbers in the sector have held steady.<\/p><p>Specifically on the question of sick pay, as the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.<\/p><p>Last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee, which will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages. As a result of this process, an Establishment Order for a sectoral Joint Labour Committee was signed in June, and the Committee is now in the process of being formed.<\/p><p>The new core funding stream will support services to meet the conditions that may be set in an Employment Regulation Order as a result of the Joint Labour Committee.<\/p><p>I published a Workforce Plan for the sector today, which includes important actions to strengthen career pathways and support recruitment. The plan also maps out a positive way forward for the sector, and I believe the services will develop further in the years ahead.<\/p><p>Regarding concerns raised in relation to the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, my Department plan to undertake a review of this programme in 2022 which will include consultation with a wide range of stakeholders involved in the provision and utilisation of the ECCE programme.<\/p><p>In terms of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), I was successful in increasing the AIM budget by &euro;3.6 million for Budget 2021. The majority of this additional allocation was used to increase AIM Level 7 supports to providers from &euro;195 per week to &euro;210 per week, as from January 2021. This funding is provided to the pre-school provider and can be used either to reduce the adult-child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance.  This adjustment (which equates to an increase from &euro;13 to &euro;14 per hour) maintains the basis of the payment that has been in place since AIM began, of equivalence to the ECCE payment for three children in the ECCE room.<\/p><p><i>First 5, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families,<\/i>commits to consider enhancements to, or extension of AIM, following completion of the evaluation of AIM. Such an extension might involve younger children, longer hours of availability of targeted supports, children with additional needs other than a disability, or children attending school-age childcare services. Any decisions on extension or reform of AIM will be informed by the findings of the end-of-year-three evaluation of AIM, which is currently underway, with the final report due in February 2022.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that my Department oversees a Case Management process through which local County\/City Childcare Committees (CCCs) and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to Early Learning and Care services in difficulty. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.<\/p><p>Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering initial, and on-going, case management assistance. The CCC, where appropriate, will proceed to make a formal notification to Pobal who will provide more consolidated support while verifying the service&rsquo;s necessity for a financial intervention. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.<\/p><p>Contact details and links to websites of all CCCs can be found on

Department and managed by my Department in association with the Central Statistics Office. The study is carried out on behalf of my Department by a GUI study team at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  <\/p>  <p>  As a longitudinal study, GUI, which surveys the same individuals over time, is ideally suited to gathering data on the effects that COVID-19 is having, and will have, on the lives of children, young people and parents.  As Minister, I am fully committed to ensuring that this study captures information about the ongoing impact of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2020, a special on-line COVID-19 specific survey was carried out with GUI participants: 12 year olds and parents of 12 year olds in the younger GUI group (Cohort &rsquo;08) and 22 year old young adults in the older GUI group (Cohort &rsquo;98). <\/p>  <p>  A Key Findings report from the survey was published in March of this year based on data from 2,277 22-year-olds, 3,301 12-year-olds and 3,901 parents of the 12-year-olds.  These children, parents and young people have been participating in GUI for over a decade, which means GUI already has a significant amount of data about their experiences pre-pandemic.   <\/p>  <p>  The survey focused on participants&rsquo; experiences of the pandemic including: the effects on learning and employment; changes in free-time activities; personal experience of and sources of information about COVID-19; and emotional well-being.  Key findings included: <\/p>  <p>  - Only half of students &ndash; in both age-groups &ndash; said it was &lsquo;always true&rsquo; that they had a quiet place to study while learning at home, which was less likely if they were from low-income families. <\/p>  <p>  - Many participants in both cohorts reported symptoms of low mood, with 22% of 12-year-olds and almost half of 22-year-olds (48%) in the low mood group. In both cohorts, this was more common for girls and young women. <\/p>  <p>  - More than 10% of 22-year-olds felt they had missed out on needed mental health support because of the pandemic. However, most 22-year-olds felt they had someone to talk to about problems and\/or who could offer practical help if they got ill.<\/p>  <p>  - Young adults aged 22 years were more likely than 12-year-olds to increase the amount of junk food or sweets they ate during the pandemic restrictions (44% versus 29%).<\/p>  <p>  - Amongst 22-year-olds who were in employment before or during the pandemic, almost half (46%) had lost their job or been temporarily laid off.<\/p>  <p>  - Parents were the most important source of information about COVID-19 for 12-year-olds but for 22-year-olds it was reading or watching the news.<\/p>  <p>  - Despite current difficulties, most participants in both cohorts were optimistic about the future.<\/p>  <p>  The full report is available on the Growing Up in Ireland website.  In addition to this report, through my Department&rsquo;s research partnership with the ESRI, a further analysis of the data from the GUI special COVID-19 survey is planned.  This new analysis will examine in more depth the experiences of 22 year olds in relation to employment and mental health outcomes. Findings from this analysis will be available early in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  A new wave of GUI data collection is currently underway with the parents and children in the younger GUI cohort who are now 13 years old, and includes questions that will capture further information on the experience of COVID-19 and update our understanding of any ongoing impact on various aspects of their lives.  A further wave of data collection from the older cohort at age 25 is also planned for 2023, with a pilot planned for 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Growing Up in Ireland study offers a unique opportunity to analyse the impact of COVID-19 because it captures information on participants across a range of areas, including physical health, socioemotional well-being, education, relationships and civic engagement &ndash; not just at a moment in time, but over time.  This means that GUI can track the impact of unexpected events, such as COVID-19, providing insights into pre and post pandemic experiences.  As GUI also collects information on participants&rsquo; sociodemographic characteristics such as social class, income or family structure, the findings can also be analysed by these factors, highlighting where experiences may differ. <\/p>  <p>  Anonymised datafiles from the GUI COVID-19 survey have been released and are available to bona fide researchers from the Irish Social Science Data Archive.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Growing Up in Ireland study, during 2020, my Department, working with the Department of Health and the youth sector, collaborated with SpunOut.ie to undertake an online consultation with young people about their experiences of COVID-19, called &lsquo;How&rsquo;s Your Head: Young Voices during COVID-19&rsquo;.  A Youth Advisory Group worked with the Department to guide the development and analysis of the consultation, which sought to better understand how young people were experiencing COVID-19, asking them what had been working well for them and what were the challenges to maintaining their wellbeing. Responses were received from 2,173 young people aged 15-24. <\/p>  <p>  The findings were published in October 2020 and highlighted a range of difficulties reported by young people, as well as a range of positives they wanted to take forward.   The most common negative effects related to the mental health of respondents, including overthinking, worry, anxiety and depression.  More than a third of young people missed their friends and many had concerns about their education, particularly those aged 18 or over.  Among the positives were self-care, quality family time, including time spent with family pets, a simpler, slower, quieter life, quality friendships and feeling less pressured. <\/p>  <p>  The findings from Growing Up in Ireland, and from the &lsquo;How&rsquo;s Your Head&rsquo; Consultation have provided important evidence that has guided our response to COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700080#WRR06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":1040,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700080#WRR06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1041,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[60525\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700080#WRR06600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the steps that will be taken in order to provide appropriate resources and an adequate supply of antigen tests for childcare providers and cr&egrave;ches in order to allow for effective operations and reduce the knock-on effects of close contact cases for staff and families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1042,"content":"<p>My Department and the HSE are currently developing an antigen testing programme for early learning and childcare services.

Working with and enabling the private sector to deliver on housing is central to this plan.<\/p>  <p>  An overarching governance framework has been established in the Department of An Taoiseach to oversee implementation with political oversight provided by the Cabinet Committee on Housing. The Housing for All Delivery Group, comprised of relevant Secretaries General, and chaired by the D\/Taoiseach, is responsible for delivery of all aspects of the Plan and ensuring genuine whole-of-government engagement. Three work streams are being led at Secretary General level with specific focus on (i) Investment; (ii) Industry capability; and (iii) Public service delivery.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has taken on chairmanship of the Industry Capability group comprising the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Department of Social Protection, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and other relevant Departments and agencies will as required\/requested.  The group is responsible for progressing actions and targets on:-<\/p>  <p>  - Initiatives associated with innovation and productivity, skills and capacity, <\/p>  <p>  - Enterprise support, standards and compliance and sectoral engagement, including the CTC and CSG, to facilitate delivery of the objectives of Housing for All.<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that residential construction sector has suitable capacity in terms of skilled labour to meet the objectives of Housing for All<\/p>  <p>  - Engaging with industry and initiatives to attract skilled labour and industry capacity from abroad. <\/p>  <p>  Any skill requirement and response to meet the needs of the sector will be determined by the group&rsquo;s responsibility to facilitate the objectives of Housing for All.<\/p>  <p>  In supporting the Housing for All plan and other skills responses of the wider economy, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out a clear objective where there will be a single apprenticeship system which will deliver a structure which supports innovation combined with strong national level supports and coordination of the apprenticeship sector. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme was established to ensure that apprenticeship plays a key part in supporting economic recovery following COVID-19. It was introduced in March 2020 and has supported a significant recovery of apprentice registrations in throughout the COVID-19 period. There have been 7,484 registrations so far in 2021 &ndash; an increase which not only exceeds expectations of a recovery of 2020 registrations which were badly impacted COVID-19, but also shows a 22% increase on 2019 figures for the same period.<\/p>  <p>  With the increased demand for Craft Apprenticeships, there has been additional pressures to the capacity of the Education and Training System. As a result, there has been a growing number of apprentices who are on waiting lists to access there off the job training. The following actions have been taken to address the growing demand and to clear the waiting lists in an timely and equitable manner:- <\/p>  <p>  -  &euro;20m capital funding has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA (&euro;10m to each sector) to provide additional structural capacity within Training Centres and IoTs\/Technological Universities.   These places began to come on-stream in September 2021 with a 20% growth on pre-COVID phase 4 and 6 spaces.  Availability of training places will continue to grow in the 2022 January, April and September intakes. <\/p>  <p>  -  As from September 2021 classes have returned to full capacity of 14-16 apprentices per class, rather than the 50% capacity which had been in place during 2020 and until Q3, 2021 under COVID-19 distancing requirements. <\/p>  <p>  -  The structure of Phase 2 delivery in the three most impacted apprenticeships is being reformed, with the institutions and partners working together to deliver an innovative teaching response to reduce waiting lists.  On-site teaching will be reduced to 18 weeks of practical work, with theory elements of the Phase delivered around the off-the-job training.  This will allow for a third intake of Phase 2 apprentices providing up to a 50% increase in availability of Phase 2 places annually. <\/p>  <p>  -  &euro;17m targeted funding has been provided for additional craft apprenticeship classes in 2022 across the further and higher education sectors. &euro;12m has been allocated to higher education provision.<\/p>  <p>  -  A significant recruitment campaign is under way to deliver the additional staffing to support the above measures.<\/p>  <p>  -  Waiting lists are continually monitored and additional targeted measures will be introduced to ensure that craft apprentices impacted by these delays are enabled to qualify from their apprenticeship as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Subject to continued access to workshops and training facilities in addition to the rollout of additional places, it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training for phases 4 and 6 will be cleared by Easter 2022, with phase 2 waiting lists cleared by year-end 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700081#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1056,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700081#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1057,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[59879\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700081#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department will issue Covid-19 safety guidelines to third-level institutions in relation to in-person Christmas exams; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1058,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[60366\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700081#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if all third-level students will be given the option to take scheduled exams online in circumstances in which students are concerned regarding ongoing public heath guidelines; if he will advise in the case of a specific institution (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1059,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 419 and 425 together.<\/p>  <p>Education is an essential service and the Government has agreed that it can continue on-site, in line with Safe Return Plan published in June.

The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.<\/p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Access to Care fund. In addition the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Access to Care fund.<\/p>  <p>  Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.

It shows significant progress in implementing the action plan for the period 2017 to 2020, with only a small number of the 50 actions outstanding. It also examined the effectiveness of government expenditure on the national drugs strategy, based on key indicators.  It estimated the significant costs for society of drug use for the criminal justice system and the economy.  The mid-term review was informed extensive stakeholder engagement, the results of the national drug and alcohol survey for 2019-2020 and findings of a rapid assessment on the impact of Covid-19 on drug and alcohol services.<\/p><p>The Department undertook considerable engagement with stakeholders, including community organisations, voluntary drug and alcohol service providers, and drug and alcohol task forces as part of the Mid Term Review.  Written submissions were requested in advance of stakeholder consultation meetings, and following these consultations written reports were circulated to ensure accuracy.The learning from the engagements formed a considerable section of the review, and input into the subsequent proposed changes.  The National Oversight Committee received regular updates on the progress of the review, and also had opportunity to discuss the draft documentation.  Stakeholders were very supportive of the conclusions of the mid-term review. <\/p><p>The national drugs strategy covers the period 2017-2025. It is a dynamic process and there is flexibility to introduce new measures to address emerging issues in the period 2021-2025. Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for the national drugs strategy for 2021-2025 were identified. These priorities strengthen the health-led approach, reflect commitments in the Programme for Government and align with the EU drugs strategy and action plan 2021-2025. <\/p><p>These priorities complement and build on the five goals in the national drugs strategy. The inter-agency approach involving a partnership between statutory, community and voluntary bodies remains central to the strategy, as does strengthening the resilience of communities to respond to the drug problem. <\/p><p>One of the new strategic priorities is to address the social determinants and consequences for drug use in disadvantaged communities. This priority recognises the additional challenges arising from drug use in disadvantaged communities, including the Traveller community. It will address the underlying social and economic determinants that increase the prevalence of problematic drug and alcohol use in certain communities. It will also tackle the criminality and anti-social behaviour associated with the drug trade that impose a heavy burden on poor communities. These issues require action across government to promote community development and community safety. Ensuring synergy with the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities programme to address health inequalities will be a key objective. A range of government departments and programmes will contribute to this strategic priority, as will the work of the drug and alcohol task forces and community drug projects. <\/p><p>Supporting these strategic priorities are a number of horizontal themes:  <\/p><p>- involvement of service users in the design and delivery of services based on a human rights perspective and the promotion of health literacy <\/p><p>- active and meaningful participation of civil society in the development, implementation and evaluation of policies and services <\/p><p>- good governance, accountability and mutual respect by all partners and <\/p><p>- cross-sectoral funding and the targeting of additional resources.<\/p><p>The oversight structures have been revised to drive the implementation of the strategic priorities for 2021-2025.  I believe that the new structures will strengthen the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society in developing national policy. I am also providing independent leadership to ensure the accountability of all stakeholders and involving service users to provide insights from the lived experience of drug and alcohol addiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700083#WRU04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700083#WRU04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1213,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[59833\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700083#WRU04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of ICU and high-dependency unit beds in the mid west and south east regions according to the most recent figures for 2021.","asker":"1613","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1214,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700083#WRU04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700083#WRU04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1216,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[59834\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700083#WRU04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will waive the &euro;100 registration fee for nurses in view of the work they are carrying out during the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1217,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the regulation of nurses and midwives in Ireland rests with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI is an independent regulatory body established under the Nurses and Midwives Act, 2011.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.<\/p><p>The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups on the 18th of November to take a series of immediate actions which include a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care, and time sensitive work, particularly in Model 4 hospitals.<\/p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan.

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.<\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached document, provided to my Department by the NTPF, which shows the breakdown of adults and children awaiting a first Outpatient appointment for Clinical Immunology by hospital.

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.<\/p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support services.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the regulatory framework, with the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined.<\/p>  <p>  The options for the funding of the new scheme are being examined through work with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) on the projected demand for, and cost of, home-support services in various scenarios.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery. In 2021 funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive and robust operational model for the rollout of interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair, and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. Funding has been provided for the recruitment of 130 posts for the national rollout of interRAI as the single assessment tool for care needs in the community.<\/p>  <p>  A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. Over the last two years, the annual home-support budget has been increased significantly. In Budget 2021, an extra &euro;150 million was allocated to fund 5 million additional hours of home-support for older people. In Budget 2022, the extra &euro;150 million has been maintained.<\/p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home-support commenced in November 2021 in the first of the four pilot sites, namely CHO 8. It is envisaged that the three other sites - CHOs 2, 4 and 7 - will be fully operational by January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  A Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group is currently being established.

The continued importance of other public health measures will continue to be emphasised.<\/p><p>The Government decision is based on a recommendation from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The NPHET, at its meeting on 25 November, considered the question of reducing the age at which mask wearing is recommended. This issue has been subject to ongoing review by the NPHET. NPHET consideration has been informed by a number of evidence reviews and advice provided to NPHET by HIQA at NPHET&rsquo;s request since February 2021, informed by research evidence developed by HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Evidence Synthesis Team and with expert input from HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group (EAG).<\/p><p>The most recent review by HIQA in August 2021 recommended that the minimum age for mask wearing should remain unchanged, however ongoing monitoring was advised with respect to the epidemiological situation in children.<\/p><p>In light of the sharp rise in the incidence in the 9 to 11 year old age-group in recent weeks the issue was therefore considered again by the NPHET. As part of its deliberations, the NPHET considered previous advice from HIQA, the detailed epidemiological situation in children, international guidance, international practice, the evidence in relation to the use of face coverings in children, and the potential benefits and harms from any recommendations. The NPHET recognised the very significant impacts previous social and economic restrictions have had on families and children to date and also reiterated that a core priority of the NPHET throughout the pandemic has been to protect the continued operation of the education and childcare sector, recognising its importance to the health and development of children. Given the very high incidence in children the NPHET advised that measures should be taken to interrupt chains of transmission to protect those core priorities. For that reason, the NPHET agreed advice, including the recommendation in relation to mask wearing, to support families and young children in staying safe over the coming period with a view to reducing risk of disease transmission. <\/p><p>HIQA&rsquo;s advice on &lsquo;Reducing the minimum age for mask wearing requirements and recommendations in COVID-19&rsquo; can be found online: <i>www.hiqa.ie\/reports-and-publications\/health-technology-assessment\/reducing-minimum-age-mask-wearing<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700084#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1260,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[59857\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700084#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the identity and qualifications in ventilation of the members of an organisation (details supplied) who advised against the need for HEPA filtration in classrooms; if he will publish the precise scientific basis on which that advice was given; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1261,"content":"<p>The HSE's Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control Division (AMRIC) was established in early 2019, under the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer.

The natural history, clinical course and consequences of COVID-19 are still not completely understood. It is recognised that most patients with COVID-19 return to baseline after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, but a proportion report ongoing health issues.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people that are affected with longer term sequelae after acute COVID-19 remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10&ndash; 20% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.<\/p>  <p>  Several organisations and societies have proposed different definitions based upon the constellation of symptoms that affect people after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. To aid recognition and management of those affected, the WHO has recently through a global consensus process proposed a working clinical case definition of Post COVID-19 syndrome occurring 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction and others which generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COVID19 episode, or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time. However, the WHO notes that this definition may change as new evidence emerges and our understanding of the consequences of COVID-19 continues to evolve.<\/p>  <p>  Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. People in the community who are concerned about persistent symptoms following Covid-19 should contact their GP in the first instance. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms.<\/p>  <p>  Specific guidance on the treatment of 'Long COVID' is presently under development both here and internationally.  The HSE is currently assessing need and the best way to care for those impacted by Long COVID to ensure the appropriate supports are in place. As part of this work on post-COVID care, the HSE is examining how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges. I understand that the HSE has also been in touch with a group of people who are suffering post-COVID symptoms to inform understanding. You may wish to note, that a  Programme Manager\/Implementation Lead and Clinical Leads have been identified within the HSE who will be key stakeholders in driving this programme of work.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to develop an understanding of the implications of Long Covid to inform policy as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700084#WRV03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1268,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700084#WRV03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1269,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[59868\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700084#WRV03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way his Department and the HSE plans to help decrease the continuously growing number of persons on the neurology outpatient waiting list in Ireland; if a plan can be put in place to employ additional specialist nurses who would liaise with patients and assist them without the requirement of having to attend outpatient departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1270,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last twenty months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.<\/p><p>More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.<\/p><p>In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services.

The development of a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services is part of these reforms.<\/p>  <p>The Action Plan states that in the first half of 2021, the Department of Health should work on advancing and continuing the development of the scheme. This work, which is ongoing, encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery. <\/p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view of bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the development of a statutory scheme for the financing of home support, the Department is undertaking work on the potential demand for and cost of the introduction of a such a scheme. <\/p>  <p>The Action Plan states that in the second half of 2021, the Department of Health should work on commencing the implementation and evaluation of the reformed model of service delivery. Funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home-support commenced in November 2021 in the first of the four pilot sites, CHO 8 (East Westmeath). It is envisaged that the three other sites in CHOs 2, 4 and 7 will be fully operational by January 2022. The recruitment of 130 posts funded for the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs is scheduled to commence in this quarter. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme.<\/p>  <p>The Action Plan states that the implementation of the home-support scheme will commence in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700085#WRW02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1340,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700085#WRW03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1341,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[59959\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700085#WRW03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when pharmacists will be included in the roll-out of the Covid-19 booster vaccination programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1342,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700085#WRW03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Decision-Making","counter":1343,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700085#WRW03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1344,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[59961\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700085#WRW03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department is working on the implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1345,"content":"<p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has overall policy responsibility for the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, with the exception of Part 8 of the Act, which is the responsibility of my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  Part 8 of the Act provides a legislative framework for Advance Healthcare Directives (AHDs).

This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Ivermectin. <\/p><p>As confirmed by HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group -<i>www.hiqa.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-02\/Interventions-to-prevent-progression_Advice.pdf<\/i>- evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention.<\/p><p>HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4th February 2021 published a statement including the following:<\/p><p>&ldquo;It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:<\/p><p>- No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;<\/p><p>- No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;<\/p><p>- A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.<\/p><p>We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Further research was undertaken by HIQA and updated advice was provided to the National Public Health Emergency Team: COVID-19 - Interventions and health related factors that prevent infection or minimise progression to severe disease - at its meeting of the 12 May 2021 and was published by HIQA on the 23 June 2021<\/p><p><i>www.hiqa.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-06\/Advice-to-NPHET_Interventions-to-prevent-COVID-19.pdf<\/i><\/p><p>One of the key findings of the review was that Ivermectin is not currently licensed for the treatment of COVID-19. From this evidence summary, there is currently insufficient information on whether it can be safely used to prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Ivermectin should therefore not be used as prophylaxis outside well-designed, regulated clinical trials as the benefits and harms are not yet clear when taken in the context of COVID-19 treatment.<\/p><p>Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness.<\/p><p>HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting to reduce the risk of progression to severe disease in patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 unless as part of an ongoing monitored clinical trial.

This process has included an assessment through an online survey by numerous experts and stakeholders, and the final report is expected to be received shortly.  A strong evidence base will be required for any new legislative measures, and the review of the OPAP will build on the work already underway to identify gaps in the implementation of the Plan, including where actions need to be progressed, whether by legislative or other means, and where further research is required.

All disability services must follow public health guidance in this area, including the prevention and management of COVID related infection.  <\/p><p>It must be noted that it may not be possible to provide services in exactly the same way as they operated before COVID-19, because of the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and the need to continue to protect people from infection risk.  Infection prevention and control measures that have been introduced to support the safe delivery of adult disability services since the onset of COVID 19 remain in place. <\/p><p>Adult Day Services: <\/p><p>Adult day services across the country reopened at full capacity on October 22nd, in line with the government's COVID 19 response &lsquo;Reframing the Challenge&rsquo; roadmap for the lifting of restrictions.<\/p><p>The quantum of day service supports have increased steadily since day services reopened in Autumn 2020. The increase in day service capacity was supported by additional funding of &euro;30 million provided in Budget 2021 to increase capacity in buildings and provide extra staff.  <\/p><p>Disability Respite Services:  <\/p><p>The delivery of Respite Services continued to operate during the pandemic, albeit at a reduced capacity. Some centres remained open, while others were temporarily re-purposed as isolation facilities. The number of respite overnights operated at just over 50% of the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan target for 2020; while the number of day only sessions operated at 62% of 2020 target. This was mainly due to necessary precautions to maintain physical distancing and to adhere to infection prevention and control requirements.  <\/p><p>Throughout the pandemic, staff and resources associated with closed or curtailed services were redeployed where possible to support residential provision and to provide for targeted in-home, community and tele-\/online supports for service users and families based on prioritised needs.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s (CHI) paediatric orthopaedic service, most scoliosis cases are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street, with Crumlin providing specialised multi-disciplinary treatment for the most complex patients. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.<\/p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Access to Care fund. In addition the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Access to Care fund.<\/p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that as of end October 2021, there were 123 patients on the spinal fusion waiting list (excluding suspensions), an increase of 3 patients compared to the end of October 2020. There were 67 patients on the waiting list for other spinal procedures (excluding suspensions), which is decrease of 8 patients compared with the end of October 2020. As at the end of October, 295 spinal surgeries had been carried out. This is compared to 313 by the end of October 2019, and to 255 spinal surgeries that had been carried out by the same period last year. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to outsourcing scoliosis procedures to other countries, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised my Department that recent experience has demonstrated that previous strategies, which looked at outsourcing spinal patients to external providers in the UK and Europe, had not been overly successful as spinal patients often require additional follow up and the management of post-operative complications. These are also compounded for patients by the need to travel overseas especially now during COVID-19. However, the HSE does have a procurement framework in place seeking additional private sector capacity, including for patients with scoliosis.<\/p>  <p>  Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1530,"content":"<p>Question No. 578 answered with Question No. 548.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1532,"qnumday":579,"qnumall":"[60271\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the current waiting time for the National Gender Clinic, which stands at over two years from the initial referral; his views on the adequacy of this timeframe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1533,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1534,"content":"<p>Question No. 580 answered with Question No. 555.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1535,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1536,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[60274\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has conducted a study on the effect or impact of lockdowns and restrictions on children, particularly vulnerable children.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1537,"content":"<p>From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ireland&rsquo;s response has been guided by seven ethical principles: solidarity, fairness, minimising harm, proportionality, reciprocity, privacy and a duty to provide care.

The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary, administrative measure to respond to the challenges being faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic, and was extended twice beyond its original planned end date. <\/p>  <p>  In broad terms, TAPS had substantially fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes and residents to address COVID-19 and therefore it was appropriate to end the standard assistance element of the scheme in June 2021. From June onwards, in recognition of the residual risk presented by the virus, Ministers Donnelly and I have agreed to the continued availability of the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme until the end of this year. This will ensure that contingency is available in the event of an outbreak.<\/p>  <p>  According to the most recent available HSE data, from 24 November, over 8,172 claims had been processed, with some &euro;120.7 million euro of direct financial support provided to the sector. Due to the extension of outbreak assistance, claims continue to be received and paid; &euro;1.75m has been paid to nursing homes under 75 separate claims for outbreak assistance since the end of June.  In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.<\/p>  <p>  There continue to be a number of outbreaks reported in nursing homes each week; however, current data suggests there may be a reduction in the number of associated cases per outbreak. The State has continued to prioritise residents of nursing homes in the response to COVID-19, including through the successful and early roll-out of the vaccine programme to nursing home residents.

The roll-out of booster vaccines has provided important protection for residents.<\/p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports.

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to improving health outcomes for all women. We will continue the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and work with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.<\/p>  <p>  Underscoring the government&rsquo;s commitment to Women&rsquo;s Health has been the establishment of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce in September 2019 to improve both health outcomes and experiences of healthcare for women and girls. <\/p>  <p>  This commitment has been reflected within Budget 2022, in the allocation of &euro;31 million for new development funding to specifically support women&rsquo;s health. This additional funding supplements both the ongoing work of the Department in key areas for women and a specific dedicated allocation for innovative approaches to women&rsquo;s health services nationwide, through the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Fund&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Women&rsquo;s Health Fund will support the delivery of the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022, which will be published in mid\/late December.<\/p>  <p>  Informed by the available evidence and engagement with women across the country, key stakeholders, clinicians, and advocates for women&rsquo;s health, the Action Plan will outline measures needed to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland. The health needs of marginalised women is recognised as an area of importance within the plan. Alongside the significant activity already in place within the Department of Health and the HSE for the health needs of marginalised groups, the Women's Health Taskforce will look to further opportunities to drive progress for these women in 2022. This consideration will be informed by the recent National Women's Council 'Radical Listening' report.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to ongoing activity, the Department of Health has oversight responsibility for the health policy for vulnerable groups such as people who are homeless, applicants for international protection, Roma and Travellers and other socially excluded groups. Responsibility for the provision of health service falls under the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Social Inclusion, which works to improve access to mainstream health services, as well as providing targeted measures.<\/p>  <p>  Migrants, refugees and international protection applicants receive a range of services to address their health needs. International protection applicants in Direct Provision are, in the main, eligible for a medical card, which gives them access to a range of health and community services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, NGOs, funded by the HSE, offer support to migrants by raising awareness of the services which are available to them.  They also provide information on how to avail of the services they may require.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Second National Intercultural Health Strategy 2018-2023 aims to provide an integrated approach to addressing the support needs experienced by service users of diverse ethnic and cultural and religious backgrounds nationally.  The goals and strategic objectives of the Strategy include enhanced accessibility of services, provision of high-quality, culturally responsive services to service users from diverse ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds.<\/p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains actions for implementation by the Department of Health and the HSE, which aims to improve health outcomes for Travellers and Roma.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Second National Intercultural Health Strategy 2018-2023 references the DSGBV Action plan and outlines further relevant actions in relation to service users from diverse ethnic and cultural groups. <\/p>  <p>  The Department will continue working to ensure that a range of health-related services and supports are operational for women affected by social exclusion, including those who are homeless, members of minority communities including Travellers or Roma, members of the LGBTI+ community, and international protection applicants.<\/p>  <p>  The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce will continue to work with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland to prioritise different issues each year with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  The National Women&rsquo;s Council is a key partner in ensuring women&rsquo;s voices are represented throughout the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce and representatives from the Council participate as members of the Taskforce. I look forward to continued collaboration with the National Women&rsquo;s Council going forward and this report will help inform the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce as they launch their Action Plan for 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":1553,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1554,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[60297\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700088#WRZ04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the definition of a professional antigen test in respect of antigen tests for inbound travel.","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1555,"content":"<p>A definition of \"rapid antigen test\" is made in S.I. 135\/2021, as amended.

The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary, administrative measure to respond to the challenges being faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic, and was extended twice beyond its original planned end date. <\/p>  <p>  In broad terms, TAPS had substantially fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes and residents to address COVID-19 and therefore it was appropriate to end the standard assistance element of the scheme in June 2021. From June onwards, in recognition of the residual risk presented by the virus, Minister Donnelly and I have agreed to the continued availability of the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme until the end of this year. This will ensure that contingency is available in the event of an outbreak.<\/p>  <p>  According to the most recent available HSE data, from 24 November, over 8,172 claims had been processed, with some &euro;120.7 million euro of direct financial support provided to the sector. Due to the extension of outbreak assistance, claims continue to be received and paid; &euro;1.75m has been paid to nursing homes under 75 separate claims for outbreak assistance since the end of June.  In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.<\/p>  <p>  There continue to be a number of outbreaks reported in nursing homes each week; however, current data suggests there may be a reduction in the number of associated cases per outbreak. The State has continued to prioritise residents of nursing homes in the response to COVID-19, including through the successful and early roll-out of the vaccine programme to nursing home residents. This prioritisation is continuing with the roll-out of booster vaccines to nursing home residents, which is expected to be completed by early December. The roll-out of booster vaccines has provided important protection for residents.<\/p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports. Many of these supports will continue to be provided by the HSE for the foreseeable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700089#WRAA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700089#WRAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1613,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[60373\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700089#WRAA04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of operating theatres in the Mater, Beaumont and St Vincent's University Hospitals that are operating on a 24\/7 basis in tabular form.","asker":"1476","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1614,"content":"<p>As this is a service matters it has been referred to the HSE for direct response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700089#WRAA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1615,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700089#WRAA05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1616,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[60374\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700089#WRAA05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients waiting for dermatology scopes as of 1 January 2021 and 1 December 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1476","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1617,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last twenty months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.

I am hopeful that we will reach our target of 4,000 licences this year, having now issued 3,718 licences to 3rd December. This is a 50% improvement on last year.<\/p>  <p>  We have engaged extensively with stakeholders on this issue. In respect of engaging specifically with forestry private forestry contractors and their representatives, both Minister Hackett and I have had several meetings with Forest Industries Ireland (FII) this year.  <\/p>  <p>  We have met jointly on four occasions and I have had a separate meeting with FII. My officials have also had several meetings with FII to discuss the licensing process, to provide clarity on processes and requirements. In the normal course of events, there is day-to-day contact with private forestry companies in relation to individual applications.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore four representatives of FII are members of the Forestry Policy Group, which is chaired by Minister Hackett, and by extension are members of the four Working Groups under Project Woodland. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Project Woodland was set up earlier this year as a framework to resolve the delays in issuing licences, as well as a vehicle to create a shared vision for woodland creation in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that substantial work has been undertaken by all Working Groups and the Project Board of Project Woodland, with regular meetings held resulting in a high level of output in both terms of quality and quantity. <\/p>  <p>  Of relevance to licensing is the external regulatory review. The Department has placed a contract for the regulatory review, with report due by end February, 2022.  It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of forest road applications, to 3rd December, the Department has issued 607 forest road licences for 244 km.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the largest amount in terms of length issued in the last five years and is almost double the annual target set in the Climate Action Plan (125km).  The Department has invested significantly in examining road applications on hand have written to registered foresters where further information was required. This work, together with improvement in ecological report drafting, is paying dividends in terms of the recent increased output. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate my commitment and that of Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, in ensuring that we maintain and improve on our licence delivery for the benefit of the sector. We will continue to work with private forestry companies and their representatives and other stakeholders towards reaching a satisfactory resolution to the current challenges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700091#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1724,"content":"<p>Question No. 650 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":1725,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700091#WRCC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1726,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[59899\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700091#WRCC03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on establishing a statutory red meat regulator.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1727,"content":"<p>I am committed to brining greater levels of transparency to the supply chain.

The SWOT analysis and Needs assessment helped to shape the CSP draft interventions that were then followed by a five-week public consultation in September 2021 with over 1,000 responses received. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has recently launched a Public Consultation on the draft Environmental Report on the draft CSP in November 2021 and my officials are currently considering these proposals as the CSP is being finalised. Consultation is also continuing via the CAP Consultative Committee and through bilateral meetings with the main representative bodies including Macra na Feirme.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current CSP proposals, Ireland will implement the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme in the new CAP programme, dedicating some 3% of the direct payments ceiling to help young farmers establish their farming businesses. <\/p>  <p>  This allocation of approximately &euro;35m per year will see qualifying young farmers benefit on a per hectare basis which will be more advantageous to young farmers than the current system, which was linked to payment entitlements. <\/p>  <p>  The proposed rate will significantly increase from approximately &euro;70\/ha in the current programme to over &euro;170\/ha with a maximum payment area of 50ha and payment on all eligible hectares, even those without corresponding entitlements. In tandem with this, we will also implement the National Reserve in each year of the new CAP to fund at a minimum the mandatory categories of young farmers and new entrants to farming. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a higher grant rate for qualified young farmers is proposed under the capital investment measure proposed under the CSP. <\/p>  <p>  The CSP will also continue to provide support for collaborative farming and will propose innovative ways to advise older farmers on succession and retirement options, which will increase the availability of land for younger farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting young farmers continues to be a priority and I will continue to actively engage on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700092#WRDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":1770,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700092#WRDD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1771,"qnumday":666,"qnumall":"[60183\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700092#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will expand the dieback scheme to help farmers clear the diseased trees and to replant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1772,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Question number 739 of 23<sup>rd<\/sup>November, in which I outlined details of the current scheme which supports those forest owners whose plantations are affected by ash dieback.<\/p><p>As outlined my Department introduced the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) in July 2020.

An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, driven by Technology and Talent. <\/p>  <p>  Food Vision 2030 sets challenging environmental goals, including becoming a climate-neutral food system by 2050, with verifiable progress achieved by 2030, encompassing emissions reductions, carbon sequestration, air, biodiversity and water quality. <\/p>  <p>  At the same time Food Vision looks to protect and build on Ireland's global reputation as a trusted supplier of high quality, safe, sustainable food to consumers at home and abroad. The sector has set itself an ambition of reaching &euro;21 billion in exports by 2030, driven by value rather than volume. <\/p>  <p>  The next iteration of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which starts in 2023, aims to foster a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector that can support the livelihoods of farmers and provide healthy and sustainable food for society, as well as ensuring vibrant rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) for the period 2023-2027 will underpin the sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s farming and food sector by supporting viable farm incomes and enhancing competitiveness, by strengthening the socio-economic fabric of rural areas, and by contributing to the achievement of environmental and climate objectives at national and EU levels. <\/p>  <p>The new CSP is structured around the achievement of three general objectives, as set out in EU legislation, including   &ldquo;- to foster a smart, competitive, resilient and diversified agricultural sector ensuring long term food security&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2021 is the most ambitious ever produced.

Snails intended for human consumption are defined in EU food regulations as terrestrial gastropods. <\/p><p>Farmers interested in snail farming may wish to refer to the helpful guidance document on snail farming produced by Teagasc which is available on its website. Furthermore, advisory support for those looking to diversify their enterprise is available through the Teagasc &lsquo;Options for Farm Families Programme&rsquo; and interested farmers should contact their local Teagasc office, details of which are available on their website. Teagasc recommends that potential snail farmers visit a commercial snail farm and get involved in a course prior to investing any resources. <\/p><p>To register as a snail farmer producing snails for live sale only, or if there is already a herd number for the holding in respect of other farming activities, and the addition of snail farming activities at the holding is required, a completed ER1 application form should be submitted to the Regional Veterinary Office (RVO). <\/p><p>All food intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of EU food law. Snail farmers who intend to process snails for human consumption must in addition to being registered as a snail farmer with their local Department Regional Veterinary Office must also be approved to operate as a food business operator with the Department&rsquo;s Meat Hygiene Division. Any person producing food is regarded as a &lsquo;Food Business Operator&rsquo;.  <\/p><p>To date there are no Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine approved food business operators processing snails for human consumption in Ireland. Any snail farmer interested in seeking approval to become a food business operator for the processing of snails for human consumption should complete a Notification of Intent application form, which is available on the Department's website at www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/57f86-approval-of-activities-at-meat-processing-businesses\/  and submit it to my Department's Meat Hygiene Division in Portlaoise. <\/p><p>The main purpose of food law is to ensure a safe food supply and to protect consumers&rsquo; interests in relation to food. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is responsible for enforcing food law in Ireland, and carries out this enforcement through service contracts with official agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  <\/p><p>There are currently no schemes under the Rural Development Programme to support snail farming. However, snail farming may benefit from wider supports such as the Enterprise Ireland's Innovation Voucher Scheme for which the Teagasc&rsquo; Food Research centres are <i>Knowledge Providers<\/i>. This scheme awards vouchers of &euro;5,000 to small companies who have a business opportunity or problem. The voucher can be exchanged for advice and expertise. Further details can be found on their website.  <\/p><p>For scheme supports under our Rural Development Programme, these generally include eligibility requirements such as being the holder of an active herd number with herdowner status and also having all lands farmed declared in the applicant's name on my Department&rsquo;s Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS). These requirements are expected to be applied in the next CAP. <\/p><p>If a person farming snails has eligible hectares and a herd number, they can submit an application for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) which does not differentiate between types of farms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700094#WRFF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":1889,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700094#WRFF00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":1888,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700094#WRFF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1889,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[60472\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700094#WRFF00900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"her plans to put measures in place to support the refurbishment of vacant property in rural areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1890,"content":"<p>The revitalisation of vacant properties is being addressed by a number of initiatives delivered by my Department in line with the commitments contained in<i>Our Rural Future<\/i>and as part of the Government's <i>Housing for All<\/i><\/p><p><i>.<\/i>In April, I announced investment of &euro;81 million for 25 landmark projects under Category 1 of the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.
