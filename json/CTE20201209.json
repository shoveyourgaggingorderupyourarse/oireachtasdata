Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. <\/p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <\/p> <p>  I also ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard, and that when members are leaving and taking their seats, they sanitise their area.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120900002#A00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607531400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of &euro;540 million.  This was an increase of &euro;84 million, or nearly 19%, on the prior year.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure was distributed across five programmes.  These are defined in terms of strategic objectives, such as: a safe and secure Ireland; and access to justice for all.  Within the programmes, in addition to provision for standard administration functions, there are funding lines for key schemes and services operated directly as part of the Department, such as the Probation Service, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service and the Forensic Science Laboratory.  Funding is also provided for a number of State bodies that have a separate statutory existence, that operate under the aegis of the Department.<\/p> <p>  The largest expenditure programme relates to the range of services that together aim to provide an efficient, responsive and fair immigration asylum and citizenship system.  In 2019, the total spend for that programme was &euro;223 million.  This was up almost &euro;62 million, or 38%, year-on-year.  The largest component of this spending related to the cost of accommodation for asylum seekers, which totalled just under &euro;130 million in 2019.  The Department has attributed the 66% increase year-on-year in the spending on such accommodation to an increase in the numbers of asylum seekers accommodated, and to significantly greater reliance on more expensive emergency accommodation arrangements.<\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that responsibility for asylum seekers&rsquo; accommodation, along with a number of other subheads, has now been transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Processing of asylum applications remains the responsibility of the Department of Justice.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control relating to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120900002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1607531400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Before I ask for her opening statement, I would like to congratulate Ms McPhillips on her appointment as Secretary General of the Department.

In all, there are approximately 60 individual subheads across five expenditure programmes.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, the Department completed the largest restructuring in our 100-year history.  This transformation programme reshaped the organisation to more effectively deliver our strategic objectives; improve transparency and accountability; and create efficiencies through clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  This represented a step-change in how a Department is structured and operates, and turned the traditional Civil Service model on its head.<\/p> <p>  In the traditional model, the Department was structured by subject matter relating to different parts of the justice and equality sectors.  Staff worked across a wide range of activities, continually prioritising a competing variety of tasks, with differing levels of complexity, importance and urgency.  The transformation programme moved us from this conventional subject-based model, for instance, policing or immigration, to a functional model where we deal with policy and legislation, facilitating the development of specialisation and expertise.<\/p> <p>  While the formal restructuring element of the transformation programme was concluded in 2019, additional work continues to support and leverage the full value of our new structure.<\/p><p> A subgroup of the management board is developing initiatives to further develop our organisational culture in support of our vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  We also reviewed the Department&rsquo;s ICT infrastructure and capacity to deliver digital services.  Work is under way to implement a new ICT strategy, with digital reform set to be a key priority in our forthcoming strategy statement.<\/p><p> The transformation programme has sought to rebuild the Department to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.  This year&rsquo;s global pandemic has provided a significant test of this new structure.  Overall, our functional model has enabled us not only to react but also to respond dynamically to the crisis.  Although some service delivery areas have been quite severely impacted, our teams have a more focused remit and despite this unprecedented crisis, our functional structure has provided the capacity to retain a focus on long-term issues.  We have been able to refrain from diverting entire teams to crisis response and instead have been able to preserve that focus and keep work going on longer-term issues through our dedicated strategic policy units.<\/p><p> Our legislation functions have been agile in supporting Government to develop and progress proposals.  Since the outset of the crisis, our governance functions have played a central role in facilitating and driving collaboration and cohesion between the key agencies in the justice sector, while our operations units supported the establishment of crisis response teams in our key service delivery areas.  Our unique transparency function has co-ordinated and managed an unprecedented demand for information throughout the crisis for all our stakeholders and the public.<\/p><p> Regarding the transfer of functions, as the Vice Chairman referenced and as members are aware, the Government established a new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which required a transfer of functions order and the transfer of functions such as disability, equality, migrant integration, international protection accommodation, which is known as direct provision, and the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  This necessitated approximately 95 colleagues transferring, along with their work, to the newly created Department with effect from 14 October last.  A relatively small number of issues relating to youth justice transferred in our direction and are now managed by our criminal policy function.  This work mainly relates to the bail supervision scheme, which provides courts with an alternative to remanding a child in detention; a research partnership with the school of law, University of Limerick, which is aimed at the development of effective youth offender programmes; as well as a project under the Dormant Accounts Fund, building on the Greentown report which is developing interventions to protect children from the malign influence of criminal networks.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, there are a large number of agencies under the overall remit, some of which are funded from this Vote.  I refer in particular to Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, which had a significant underspend in 2019 relating to the long planned new purpose-built laboratory.  I am glad to report that construction started on that building in March and it is well under way, despite the impact of the pandemic on construction activities in the earlier part of the year.  This new laboratory will provide FSI with a modern, state-of-the art facility, supporting the highest standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage.  The aim is to have a forensic facility meeting all standards for the avoidance of contamination and the recovery, identification and interpretation of trace forensic evidence, including DNA.  This represents a significant and important investment in the criminal justice system.  The new building is expected to be completed in the summer of 2022.<\/p><p> I will also mention the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  While expenditure incurred for the bureau is reflected in the Vote, at &euro;9.860 million in 2019, the other side of the equation is not apparent from the account as the moneys collected go directly to the Exchequer.  The money returned to the State as a result of CAB actions was in excess of &euro;3.9 million in 2019, which includes &euro;1.6 million returned under the proceeds of crime legislation, just over &euro;2 million collected under Revenue legislation, and &euro;300,000 recovered in social welfare overpayments.  The bulk of these actions related to the proceeds of drug trafficking, followed by fraud and theft.<\/p><p> In addition, the value of assets frozen during the year was &euro;64.9 million, which is a very significant figure, compared with &euro;8.4 million in 2018.  That increase is due in the main to a significant seizure of cryptocurrency to the value of &euro;53 million.  There were 326 individual assets frozen, including financial assets, property, vehicles and jewellery.  In all, CAB brought 31 new proceeds of crime proceedings before the High Court in 2019, the largest number of new cases commenced by the bureau in a single year.  At an international level, CAB has maintained strong links and continues to liaise with law enforcement and judicial authorities throughout Europe and worldwide.<\/p><p> The work of the Legal Aid Board is also funded from this Vote.  The board operates a total of 30 full-time and 12 part-time offices.  It employs approximately 420 staff and provides services both via directly employed solicitors and panels of private practitioners who are engaged to provide services such as Abhaile and to service District Court family law matters. The board also provides free family mediation services in 16 family mediation offices, some of which are co-located with their law centres.<\/p><p> In the context of the pandemic and the need to prioritise services and safety for our most vulnerable citizens, the Department developed an inter-agency action plan to help support people at increased risk of domestic abuse during this period.  Members will have heard about the Garda Operation Faoiseamh, most recently this morning.  This was supported by priority measures across the entire system, including by the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service, for domestic abuse, sexual assault and child protection cases.  The Legal Aid Board help line is helping to deliver prompt legal advice and legal representation in court.  I will leave it at that, although I am happy to go into further detail if members wish me to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120900002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607531400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McPhillips.

It is okay saying that people can engage with the ombudsman and so on but that takes time and people are living their lives, perhaps, in very overcrowded facilities.

I am two months into my role as Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Market Union.  To some extent my mandate has been set out in the letter the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, sent to me on my appointment.  There are a few specific areas that colleagues might like to come back on but generally, it refers to progressing banking union, capital markets union, dealing with green finance and a strategy on how we move towards a more sustainable and a more digital economy.  It looks at a fintech strategy because technological solutions are coming at an advanced speed, particularly given the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p><p> One of the other issues we are considering in detail concerns our review of the non-financial reporting directive, whereby companies have to report not just on profit but also on how they have an impact on society, the environment, human rights, etc.  We want to make sure that in future, financial and non-financial information will be equal when it comes to accounts.  That is quite a leap.  We already have some standards but this will be a leap forward.  While Europe is doing its own thing, it is very much considering the global work on this.  It is fair to say the EU is likely to move further and faster than the rest of the world when it comes to asking corporations to account for non-financial matters.  It is therefore required that we scrutinise the relevant information.  One point of feedback we get from investors is that they find it difficult to obtain sufficient information to compare companies.  There is now much greater emphasis on this, even among asset managers and individual investors, who want to be able to say they are investing in sustainable projects.  This will intensify.  In the early part of next year, I will be introducing a sustainable finance strategy.  There will be a very interesting debate on that.  In other words, all our activities within the Commission are focused on our reorienting the European economy to make it more sustainable.<\/p><p> In tandem &mdash; we have seen this already because of Covid-19 &mdash; we are moving towards a more digitalised economy.  That is the strategy.  In the financial sector, in particular, we are aware that cash is still used but because of Covid, there is much more use of cards and instant-payment transactions without cash.  That is something we are watching.  We do not want to diminish the role of cash but we must make sure the solutions that are provided are regulated.  While instant payment is really positive, there are clearly concerns over fraud and protecting consumers.<\/p><p> Another area of my work concerns anti-money laundering.  Up to now, member states have had their own financial investigative units.  There has been a variety of approaches among member states and no genuine European co-ordination.  There is now political consensus among the member states that we need European co-ordination so a European agency to co-ordinate what is happening at member state level is required.  There is support for that.  We will work to make sure the financial investigative units within the member states network better and also network effectively with Europol.  Therefore, there are many aspects of the work I am charged with.<\/p><p> One of the most far-reaching aspects of my work concerns sustainable finance.  We have to try to encourage the move away from investment in projects or sectors that do harm to the climate, environment and biodiversity.  The major question, which may arise in our conversation, concerns how we accommodate the transition for sectors that want to be sustainable, considering that we know, through our taxonomy, what the best is.  This is quite a difficult area.<\/p><p> I shall mention two other issues on which questions may arise.  One is the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the future budget.  As members know, there are important negotiations continuing on that.  In addition, there is work on the next-generation EU fund, which involves a significant proposal regarding a very significant amount of money to help the EU to recover from the Covid crisis.<\/p><p> Last, I will mention Brexit.  Members know the state of play.  I share the pessimism of the Taoiseach when he spoke in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  In the Commission, we have particular concerns about making sure any state with access to the Single Market &mdash; in this case, the UK &mdash; plays by the rules of that market.  Other issues arise, including governance and the fishing sector.  Today, we are preparing contingency plans.  They are very specific and very narrowly focused to make sure that in the event of no deal, which we hope will not be the outcome, specific plans will be put in place to maintain connectivity for those sectors that are vulnerable, such as transport and aviation.<\/p><p> While we are looking forward to the meeting that will take place between the UK Prime Minister and the President of the Commission, I am not very confident about it considering the speech made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons today, or at least the excerpts I have read.  There is a failure to understand that membership of the EU means something, that if a state is part of the EU, it is in the Single Market and customs union, and that member states make rules together.  Perhaps this was a failure of Brexit at the very outset.  If, as has happened, a state chooses to leave, there are consequences for it, particularly where it wants to stay part of the Single Market.  The EU is doing no more than it would in any other case.  What it is doing is protecting the Single Market of the EU 27, which has been built up over decades with the UK.  There is a failure in the UK to understand that.  This has not just arisen in recent days; it has featured from the very outset of the Brexit process.<\/p><p> On a slightly more optimistic note, I welcome the agreement on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.  I believed it very perverse that any country would use a statement in its Parliament that it would break international law as a threat in a negotiation.  It was most unhelpful and unwelcome.  The rowing back on that is welcome.  It shows some understanding that it was never appropriate in the first place.<\/p><p> While we are hoping for a deal, we must also prepare for the possibility of there not being an agreement.  We have said over weeks, months and years that time is running out.  The prospect of the negotiation running into next week is really not realistic if a deal is to be ratified through the European Parliament and perhaps other parliaments.  Therefore, we are running out of road.  We are aware of that.  In Europe, we are prepared and know what needs to be done.  I hope the British Prime Minister will conclude when he comes to Brussels today that if he wants Britain to be part of the Single Market while remaining outside the European Union, it must meet the standards we have in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#B00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Choimisin&eacute;ir.

At the end of last year, the proportion was just below 5% but unfortunately it has increased since then, to just above 6% at the end of June.  On 2 December, the Commissioner said that NPLs would receive her full attention and that we need to find a mechanism to unburden banks with NPLs.  I am aware that the Directorate-General will introduce what is called a new comprehensive NPL strategy in the next two weeks.  Can the Commissioner tell us what that strategy will involve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#B00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The strategy will be unveiled next week.  It is a communication.  I will explain why we are producing it this year.  The Deputy rightly said there were problems with NPLs in the past in Ireland.  There were also problems in other member states.  Currently, because of the supports coming from member states, the policy of the European Central Bank, and various moratoria, we do not have a problem now.  We do not want to have a problem.  There are two aspects to this.  First, borrowers and lenders should identify at this stage individuals or sectors in respect of which problems might arise and there might be an agreement on restructuring.  However, there is a concern that as this crisis unfolds into next year, some sectors and enterprises will not be able to recover and, therefore, may not be able to repay loans.<\/p><p>The dilemma, which I referenced in my hearing, is that if we leave non-performing loans on-balance sheet in the banks, they then are impaired in terms of being able to lend to the real economy.  The objective is to have the groundwork prepared if this occurs, and we do not know to what extent that it might.  In the past, member states dealt with this in different ways, one way being as an asset management company, a securitisation where non-performing loans are moved off-balance sheet, purchased by risk-takers, and on which is put various names.  That will frees up the balance sheets of banks.<\/p><p> It is hugely important that the protection of borrowers is foremost in our minds and we know of experiences in the past.  Indeed, I was, and probably still am, an elected representative in that I would have dealt this year with individual constituents who had loans that were bought by so-called vulture funds but they could not make contact with them.  I am well aware of what happened in the past.  That is why in our work here with the Directorate-General, DG, we have been stressing, as it has in return, the importance of protecting borrowers who might find themselves in a position where they are unable to repay loans.  It is a difficult balancing act.  That is why I initially referenced the importance of now.  I mean those who feel they will have a problem with not being able to meet their commitments and banks which see this problem to deal at the individual level first.  In the strategy, the details of which will be unveiled next week, we will look at how we set forward a framework that member states can choose from to meet these challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Commissioner's comments.  The language that she used was about unburdening banks with non-performing loans so they can lend into the real economy.  These loans are individuals, people and families.  I happened to meet one of these families on my way in here about 20 minutes ago.  They are a real family who have lost their home as they face into Christmas and they are part of the real economy.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner said we need to learn from the past.  What lessons have been learned?  Does she believe that when a bank enters into a contract with an individual to provide lending but the individual falls on hard times, whether that is due to a pandemic or a recession, the bank has a responsibility that goes beyond, to use her language, \"unburdening\" that loan so it can lend to others who will continue to increase its profits and has a moral and financial obligation to the family to work through the loan?<\/p> <p>  The Commission seems to be trying to make it easier for banks to sell loans to vulture funds.  I ask the Commissioner to talk about the framework that would allow for the establishment of asset managed companies.  It has been suggested that this would only apply to business loans.  Does the Commissioner see this also applying to family homes?  I mean where one could have a National Asset Management Agency-type entity that would take the loans off the balance sheets of the banks,  and, therefore, doing as she has suggested, but not the likes of Cerberus, which is a complete and utter vulture that treated its customers with disdain.  It is not just about being able to talk to somebody; it is how people are treated.  The problem is that vulture funds, by their definition, do not have a long-term interest in the Irish economy.  One cannot take a 30-year product or a 25-year mortgage and feel that it is secure in the hands of a vulture fund.  I worry about the direction we are going in.  If I were part of a young couple starting off and taking out a mortgage, I would worry about where the mortgage would end up if hard times occurred.  Indeed, it does not have to be a case of non-performing loans because we have seen in the past that banks sold performing loans to vulture funds.  Yes, these are regulated now but vulture funds, like any bank, can increase their variable interest rates to whatever level they want.  The reason mainstream banks do not do that is because of competition.  Vulture funds do not provide as much freedom or flexibility to manoeuvre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#C00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I do not think there is much that divides us Deputy.  As I said in my remarks, I am as concerned as he is about those who find themselves in hard times.  This time the crisis has not arisen due to past mistakes made by banks or people over borrowing.  This time we have businesses and individuals, as he pointed out, who for no reason of their own find themselves in a very difficult place and I have a full understanding of that.  In fact, in my conversations at the Commission, I speak to the specialist teams about the importance of protecting the individual and ensuring that if banks sell bundles of loans to another vehicle, the protection of the borrower is as strong in that move as it was with the original borrower.  I think we have learned that lesson.<\/p> <p>  I used the word \"unburden\" in connection with balance sheets.  We know that the current flow of credit from banks in this crisis have helped to keep the real economy afloat.  What we do not want to see but must prepare for is a time when there might be a build up of non-performing loans.  The Deputy referenced that in Ireland there has been a significant decrease in this, which is positive, but we need to prepare for what might happen.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament is very concerned about citizens and individuals.  This is a process that goes through the Parliament as well.  I think we have learned that lesson.  We need to understand the difficult challenge of maintaining a credit flow into the real economy if there is a build up of non-performing loans but we have the past to guide us.  There are aspects of the past, which the Deputy referenced and which I understand, that I would not like to see happen again.<\/p> <p>  This morning I received an email from a constituent who has a very severe problem so, like the Deputy, I am in direct contact with the real world.  I can assure him that everything we do here will be mindful of what happens in the real world and the emotional pain people experience when faced with a situation of not being able to repay loans.  Parliaments must have wider discussions on how to move from this current phase towards a recovery.  While at the moment there is a lot of money going out, member states' governments are supporting the real economy, the banks are there and the European Central Bank, ECB, is driving this policy, how and when that will change and how that will be managed.

The report also states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...provided either by specialist counter-fraud service or by specialised employees not necessarily with the use of BDA tools.

What concern does the Commissioner have about the fact that anybody listening to this conversation is probably unaware that an image they post on their social media or a video of them on a family holiday may be used by some of the largest insurance companies in Ireland to determine how far they can push up their premium before they move or shop around?

As it pertains to her portfolio, what may come about after 31 December in terms of the strategy for European Union financial services, given the opportunities and challenges that Brexit presents?  Where can EU member states fill the gap or begin to compete with the City of London?  I will come back to the second question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#D00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question and his kind words.  On the general Brexit point, much of the focus is on the trade agreement and the withdrawal agreement.  Of course, there is an impact on the financial sector.  At the moment and when the UK was part of the EU, London was our financial centre and a very large one.  There were other centres but London was a major one.<\/p> <p>  In the process of Brexit, we have looked at areas where there were risks to financial stability that might impact us.  We have made decisions in a limited number of areas to protect financial stability.  This is done through equivalence decisions.  We give equivalence, so in other words, what is happening in the UK is equivalent to the EU in areas of significance to us in the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy points to a wider question.  Come 1 January, when the UK is a third country, London will still be a major financial centre.  There is then a question for us to look at in greater detail for the future.  Is it appropriate that the European Union would be reliant on a major financial centre in a third country which we are not the regulator of?  Already there is some movement of businesses and assets from London because of this, although not to a significant extent yet.  There might have been an expectation that things would work out.  We have asked the United Kingdom in a range of areas to provide answers to particular questions relating to making decisions about where they intend to be in the future and how that will sit with our rule book around financial services.  We continue to look for that information.  As of now, the passporting which UK firms could, because they were part of the European Union, operate across borders in the EU will go.  There will be significant change.<\/p> <p>  On the specifics of the Deputy's question about opportunities, that has to be answered by the member states looking at what they want in terms of financial stability for the European Union.  Some believe we need one centre within the European Union.  Perhaps that is not necessary in a more digital world.  There may be room for other centres, but we have to ask ourselves a question about whether we want to be overly reliant on the City of London when it comes to the entire financial sector.  There are potentially opportunities there.  There are many who want to hold everything within the City of London.  Perhaps it goes back to the general point I made that a member state is part of everything that goes with being a member state.  If a state opts out, there are consequences to that.  There are consequences for the City of London which players and stakeholders there are well aware of. <\/p> <p>  There will be an issue if there is no deal.  Tensions arise when negotiations take place.  Trust can be strained.  If there is no deal, it makes life that little bit more difficult in terms of the relationships we would have, at least in the short term.  The issue of the financial services coming from the City of London will come home to us to be dealt with in greater detail from 1 January onwards.  We have taken decisions where it was necessary and we are watching other areas.  The committee will be aware that the UK has granted a number of equivalents to the European Union in areas that it felt were important, but we have not reciprocated because they are not areas of significance from an EU perspective.  It is an area with potential opportunities and challenges and we need to be aware of both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I agree with the Commissioner.

It goes back to the point I made about the evolution of the digital era in finance, which has been accelerated by Covid-19.  There are many innovative fintech companies starting up, which is positive.  Equally, with the speed at which this has happened and cryptocurrencies have been established, we have to regulate stronger and better to avoid such issues.

That perhaps puts more emphasis at EU level on investigating what a digital euro might look like and what its impact would be.

I cannot see it happening for a couple of years, but it is something that we need to be on top of.  There is a working group within the Commission that works with the ECB on this topic.

Like all companies, banks have been affected by Covid, but the situation needs to be put in a certain context.  For the decade running up to the Covid situation, bank profits were rising.  There were significant bank profits year on year for a decade.  For example, in 2019, nearly 15% of all dividends paid out by European companies were paid out by banks.  Covid affected them earlier this year but, from what I can see, they have been making a good recovery since then.  For example, in the third quarter of this year, BNP Paribas made net quarterly profits of &euro;1.9 billion.  On the other hand, the situation for bank workers has not been as good.  Some 60,000 jobs were lost in 2019 and 50,000 branches were shut in the decade from 2008 to 2018.  That has been reflected in Ireland.  Members of the committee met representatives of the bank workers' trade union recently and were given information about the situation in Ulster Bank.  Some &euro;3.5 billion in dividends has been paid from Ulster Bank to NatWest since 2016, but now 3,000 jobs and 88 branches - the entire network - are on the line as a result of the NatWest review.  In the Irish banking sector as a whole, there are 6,000 jobs on the line.  I believe the profits that have been made or are being made by banks should be invested back into jobs, services and a better society.

He covered a significant amount of ground.  I will deal with his specific question at the end of my response.  Financial institutions were not exactly banned from giving out dividends.  Strict guidelines stating it would not be appropriate in the context of the Covid-19 crisis were put in place.  As I stated in response to another member, we do not know how this crisis will evolve.  We are concerned that if, for example, there is an increase in infections and perhaps further restrictions after Christmas, that will have a further dampening effect on economic activity and more guidance may well be issued.  What will happen is not fixed in stone.  We know that banks were asked to abide by the guidance.  They have stuck with the guidance and advice not to pay dividends.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second specific question relates to Ulster Bank, etc.  I am aware of that issue.  I have been contacted by the unions involved and I will be meeting them for a full briefing on this issue.  The issue of bank closures is ongoing and long-standing.  It is, perhaps, partly due to the reality of the situation.  I am not sure if any of my adult children ever go to a bank branch.  I think there is a generational issue.  I was very familiar with bank branches when I was younger, but many people today use their phone or whatever to make transactions.  I acknowledge that it has been difficult for workers in the banking sector.  If the future evolves in such a way that we all use fewer physical infrastructures such as bank branches and instead use more technologically driven structures, that will have consequences for the workers or the number employed in banks.  The Deputy can rest assured that I will be listening directly to the trade unions concerned which will provide me with the full information.  Obviously, the Commission cannot interfere in a decision by a bank to do what it wishes to do.  I am not yet clear from the information I currently have whether a decision has been taken to sell off or close down.  I am not clear in that regard from what I have read thus far.

As Commissioner McGuinness is aware, the Commission previously identified Ireland as one of the member states with tax rules that are used by companies to engage in aggressive tax planning.  In July, Commissioner Gentiloni proposed using Article 116 of the EU treaty for tax policy purposes.  The article allows the Commission to move against member states that distort market competition.

On the global level, we are working with the OECD on the general issue of payment of taxes and the levels perhaps not paid by some large corporates that can operate across borders.  What Commissioner Gentiloni stated and I support is that if there cannot be a global agreement, the Commission will come forward with proposals.  This comes from a sense within society that very large corporates have the capacity to move in order to benefit from various tax regimes.  We have to watch what happens at the global level and then see where the Commission will move.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of fiscal rules, the Deputy asked whether we will go back to where we were or back to normal.  I am not sure of the exact term she used.  I do not think that post Covid we will go back to the way we were.  The pandemic has had significant impacts across society and not just in terms of the economy.  There is no plan as to when and how this current situation will unravel towards going back to any particular rule book, but we know that something will have to be done regarding what fiscal supports are made available and how long that can continue.  I do not have a blueprint or a clear answer on that issue.<\/p><p>When the crisis hit the Commission rightly provided as much flexibility as possible within the existing framework to allow member states to support businesses, individuals and employees so that the worst impacts would not hit.  We all know that without those supports across the member states we would be in a more difficult situation.  The President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has said very clearly on several occasions that member states should not unravel the supports sharply and that it needs to be done over time and very carefully.  I do not think there is a clear answer to that in terms of a timetable.  I refer to my point about non-performing loans.  We know that things will evolve.  We are hoping to manage the most difficult aspects of this, taking into account the reason behind the current pandemic, and to do it in a way that is appropriate.  We do have a framework which is more flexible now because of the pandemic but there is not a decision taken already that in six months we will go back to the way we were.  It will take a longer timeframe and greater analysis as to how we do return to some form of normality.  I reiterate that this pandemic has had a quite a profound affect not just on economies but on societies.  There will be a requirement to understand how communities are and how people have been affected.  Apart from the terrible tragedies of the numbers that have died across the European Union and in Ireland and the families that are grieving there are those other impacts we have already discussed here.

The mandate I have been given and that I am working on is to try to move forward banking union in order that we can have a sector that is cross-border.  It is impossible or really difficult to get a loan for something in one member state financed by a bank in another.  These are barriers to the free movement of capital and banking services.  It will take some time to crack the idea of a banking union.  That is where we will see, I would hope, movement on this particular issue around mortgage interest rates.  <\/p> <p>  One of the Deputies referenced bank profitability.  Currently, interest rates are really low and there has been a very high increase in deposits because those who are in employment and continue to be paid are not spending due to the fact that shops were not open but equally because of uncertainty.  In some cases, negative interest rates are being paid on what they have in banks.  There is also a link to the wider remit of the capital markets union.

I want to raise a couple of issues that are of particular interest, some of which have been already referred to by other speakers to some extent.  <\/p> <p>  The first is the issue raised by Deputy O'Callaghan in regard to high mortgage interest rates.  As the Commissioner will know, in the past anybody who borrowed in this country and throughout the European Union and did not keep up to date with their payments had penal interest rates imposed on them.  This meant they had no chance whatsoever of recovering or competing in the market in which they were operating.  They were condemned before they started and then they were blamed for what happened.<\/p> <p>  I have previously discussed the following issue with the Commissioner.  We are still recovering from the ripples of the financial crash in this country and we are still being punished for it, which I understand.  However, there is one thing that needs to be borne in mind.  Deputy Doherty mentioned the activities of vulture funds.  It is very seldom I agree with him, but I would agree with him on the points he made in that regard.  I have dealt with many of the vulture funds across the table in individual cases and I have been shocked.  Not all of them are the same.  I have been shocked at the way they treat people.  In many cases, when partners in a household were crying their eyes out in front of such people they got no response other than a glazed look at the middle distance, which clearly showed that they had no intention of even conceding.  <\/p> <p>  The primary lending institutions and the secondary lending institutions are applying current standards to a situation that they previously applied different standards to eight or ten years ago.  They are taking the view that the right way to do this is A, B and C.  They did not say that when they were lending to the people concerned.  In fact, they said the reverse.  A number of bankers from outside of this jurisdiction visited here to our cost because the undermined the stability of the market, all in pursuit of market share, as the Commissioner will know.  The result of that has been the withdrawal of many banks and the insurance companies as well.  They withdrew to their homelands and walked away with no responsibility good, bad or indifferent.  I blame the Central Bank of Ireland for allowing these things to happen, as I have done before and will do again.  I blame the European Central Bank, ECB, on which there was Irish representation from the Central Bank of Ireland for allowing these things to happen in this country and across Europe. <\/p> <p>  I know that the Commissioner's heart is in the right place and that there are other hearts in different locations across Europe.  My final point is in regard to the Apple case.  I profoundly disagree with Deputy Doherty's remarks in that regard.  I do not accept the case he put forward.  I had occasion to dispute this issue with a former Commissioner for Competition in this House a couple of years ago.  I believe there was an intention to discourage foreign direct investment in this country.  The way in which we were portrayed internationally has been very unhelpful, in pursuit of the single objective of winning the argument.  The depiction of the poor unfortunate donkey having a carrot dangled on a fishing rod in front of it comes to mind.  I was embarrassed to see the way that particular argument was emerging.  That is how it was.  Suffice it to say, we are responsible for taxation and manufacturing in our own country.  That should continue.  We should not under any circumstances allow a situation to develop whereby we are seen as a second, third, fourth or fifth option location for foreign direct investment in order to appease those who feel the investment should go to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#F00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I will not respond to the Deputy's comments on the Apple case.  I think it has been well argued on both sides.  I have made my intervention on that already.  To some extent, perhaps it needs to go to the final stage so that there is legal clarity.<\/p> <p>  On the second point in regard to the treatment of borrowers that run into difficulty, we have had a good exchange about that.  There is nobody in the room, online or physically, who does not have huge concerns about what happened in the past because we all know people who experienced difficulties.<\/p><p>I will make two points about this time.  One is that, where there are problems, there is an onus on both banks and borrowers to sit down together early and find solutions.  That would help alleviate an over-accumulation of non-performing loans.  When people are in financial distress they tend not to be able to cope.  It is a terrible place to be and I have dealt with many constituents in that position.  If there are situations where people know that their business is in a difficult place because of a public health crisis, my plea is that the banks and the borrower get together now.<\/p><p> On the wider issue, we have not heard and I would be interested if there can be a response.  The proposals and communication we will come forward with next week on non-performing loans have a twofold objective.  Primarily, it is to ensure we can continue the flow of credit into the economy from banks, which is essential, while also managing loans that are not being repaid and protecting the borrower.  We have learned lessons from the past.  I have referred to this and it is clear.  Deputy Durkan made the observation, and I hope I picked it up correctly, that sometimes people when they borrow are not aware of all the details of the loan, interest rates and so forth.  That allows me to refer to an issue on which I hope all members of the committee will support me.  It is backed up by research.  It is that when it comes to financial literacy, many of us do not understand the basic concepts in the financial world, even though we will deal with it on many occasions throughout our lives.  It is also true that one third of European households are financially fragile.  That means that where they face an unexpected crisis in their finances, they cannot cope with it.  There is a very vulnerable sector of our society that needs support on financial issues and financial literacy.  We are moving into a more digital world in which everything is instant and immediate.  Those of us who had a cheque book and a pen used to have to think, at least, because one was signing the cheque.  There is now a generation that does not even know what a cheque book is.  We now need to understand that we make more rapid financial decisions.  We make them instantly and we need to have knowledge in order that we have the power to make the right decisions.<\/p><p> It is one of my.priorities, a personal priority, to make the financial world more visible to the wider society and to develop a framework on financial literacy so member states can, if they choose, use this framework to make citizens more financially aware.  Clearly, education is the remit of each member state but when it comes to finance, we could do a great deal to improve financial literacy to help all of us to make better financial decisions and, perhaps, avoid some of the worst impacts when financial decisions turn out to be difficult or go in the wrong direction.  I would appreciate the committee's support for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I wish to add my voice to the voices of previous speakers when they spoke to the Commissioner about the activities of vulture funds in Ireland, and to underline the fact that they are causing devastation in society.  Her last point relating to financial literacy is central to what is happening.  The borrowers are now faced with dealing with a vulture fund and the language being used by the vulture funds is high-end financial language, which is poorly understood by those who are trying to engage in finding a solution to their problem with the vulture funds.  In addition, the vulture funds, by and large, ignore the regulation regarding the loan they have just purchased.  They put the borrower to great strain.  They are breaking businesses and individuals and they are repossessing farms.  We are losing a generation of entrepreneurs because of what they are doing.  People end up on the Irish Credit Bureau list and their future is damaged beyond repair.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Commissioner, in 2021, to put individuals at the centre of what she is doing.  They have suffered badly from the financial crash and from the ongoing financial difficulties they have experienced through the pandemic.  They now need a break.  It appears to me, from hearings at this committee over the past five years, that banks ignore them.  They pay lip service to the regulation.  I believe this country has a banking sector that is close to being out of control, and I do not say that lightly.  The Commissioner is meeting the Irish Financial Services Union regarding Ulster Bank.  It is shocking that 3,000 employees of that bank, through their representatives, cannot have a constructive meeting about the future of the bank and their jobs.  The customers are also worried.  It tells one a great deal about the attitude of banks, including the attitude of Ulster Bank to this Parliament, because its representatives will not turn up, and its attitude to trade unions, because it will not engage with them.  In the course of next year we are faced with that problem in Ulster Bank, 1,500 jobs in doubt in AIB and a further number of that type in Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  A great deal must be done by Europe to deal with financial literacy, on the one hand, and then to deal with the controls that are necessary on the mainstream banks to support those who are in mortgage difficulty and to provide mortgages, as Deputy O'Callaghan said, at a reasonable interest rate.  The Sparkasse bank model is often discussed in this committee in terms of its interest rates and the community nature of that bank.  I would love to see the Commission promoting the concept of community banking, to give people the opportunity to engage with that type of banking system.  It is far more sensitive to their needs than the vulture funds and the other banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#G00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I will respond briefly.  What the Chairman has just said is what I have said several times since taking up this position.  People have to be at the centre of what I do here.  The banking system relies on people.  The idea of financial literacy is something I personally intend to pursue.  I am glad to have spoken to an Oireachtas committee so it is aware of my interest in this.  We spoke earlier about the sensitivities at present and the trauma people suffered in the past and, potentially, will suffer again in this crisis.  I am well aware of that, perhaps because I have come through elections and I understand people and their position.  We also need to work towards solving some of these difficulties and helping people to get help early rather than let a problem build up, which is what often happens.  All of us have a responsibility to communicate, which I will be doing more directly next week when we launch our communication on non-performing loans.  We need a financial system that is competitive and meets the needs of citizens.  It is evolving rapidly.  The Chairman mentioned the threat to jobs in banks.  I am aware of this as well.<\/p> <p>  This is our first opportunity to engage and I welcome the comments.  I have taken note of them.  I am not 100 days in the job - I believe it is 60 days - so it is not too bad to have absorbed quite a heavy workload that was already in place but needs to be propelled further.  However, I live in a rural community and I understand the issues that affect people.  I listen more than I speak when I am out and about, if we ever get back to a place without masks.  I will understand and convey the sensitivities of not just Irish citizens but all European citizens when it comes to their dealings with the financial system.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we need a financial system that works.  It is vital for business and individuals.  It is my job to maintain that and to make it work better.

At the Irish Cancer Society we see the impact of this every day.  Through our support line, daffodil centres, night nurses, advocacy network, fundraisers and volunteers, patients share their experiences, and the human side of cancer care is revealed.  Patients have told us about the layers of additional anxiety and distress of having cancer in a pandemic.  As well as this, we have been struck by the overwhelming fear and loneliness felt by people who have received life-changing news alone and who have spent considerable periods of time cocooning since March.  We thank every healthcare worker who has made this journey easier through his or her kindness, professional knowledge, understanding and empathy shown to the thousands of patients who are currently using Ireland's cancer services.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Cancer Society is in the business of hope.  We know that cancer numbers are growing, but we believe things can and must get better.  We point to the national cancer strategy and the incredible cancer workforce in Ireland and we say that the future is positive.  Yet, the performance of some cancer services is getting worse, not better, due to historical underfunding, lack of capacity in the system and an under-resourced and incomplete workforce.<\/p> <p>  Thankfully, this has been recognised by the Minister for Health and cancer services received substantial funding in the budget this year.  However, the scale of the challenge is immense.  While increased funding is vital, money alone will not solve all the problems.  Covid-19 has had a devastating effect on a system that for many years had insufficient capacity to be able to assure people that they would get diagnosed and treated for cancer as quickly as they should.  Insufficient hospital capacity, inbuilt inefficiencies and too few healthcare professionals along with an increase in cancer cases of between 3% and 4% annually has led to lengthy and growing waiting lists.  Longer waiting lists mean delays in diagnosis and treatment.  Delayed diagnosis and treatment can mean worse patient outcomes.  The truth is that, in Ireland, access to care is being rationed by waiting lists, and until these are eradicated, patient care and, sometimes, outcomes will be compromised.<\/p> <p>  I appeal to committee members to imagine being symptomatic but being unable to get timely access to a test to find out what is wrong.  This is the reality for thousands of people waiting for a diagnosis in Ireland.  For instance, we understand that there may be in excess of 100,000 people waiting for a radiology appointment.  This includes urgent, semi-urgent and routine waiters for ultrasound, CT and MRI tests.  The demand for radiology services is steadily rising at an annual increase of between 8% and 10%.  In the national cancer strategy, the vital role of radiology in diagnosing cancer was called out and the strategy document outlined that there are substantial deficiencies in access to such services.  In Ireland, recent reports have found that we have fewer radiologists and radiographers than is recommended by international best practice.  This has led to high workloads compared with peers in other countries and correspondingly high waiting lists for patients.<\/p> <p>  Timely access to cancer treatment is vital.  Yet, capital investment to expand capacity and infrastructure in many oncology day wards throughout the country was badly needed pre Covid.  Medical oncology was routinely working above capacity.  Now, the reduction in hospital occupancy capacity to 85% in line with clinical guidance on safe practice for patients and staff and the ongoing risk that staff will need to take Covid-19 leave puts further pressures on waiting lists.  Even if capacity is expanded, we doubt that additional staff are available.  In the case of surgical treatment, only seven in ten patients were able to get care within the appropriate timeframe up to the end of 2019.  Covid-19 has made accessing operating theatres more difficult, and timeframes from diagnosis to surgery are of particular concern to us.<\/p> <p>  One of the most critical key performance indicators in the national cancer strategy, which relates to the centralisation of surgery, will be missed at the end of this year.  Progress must be accelerated in this area.  We have previously called for protected surgical time for oncology cases and we believe the national cancer control programme needs to consider how to improve diagnosis-to-treatment timeframes.<\/p> <p>  Another area I wish to draw to the attention of committee members is genetic services.  Waiting lists exist at every point on the pathway for people who have or may have a genetic risk of cancer.  Currently, genetic services and the downstream services that are needed by patients are underdeveloped and under-resourced.  As well as the development of genetic services as envisioned in the national cancer strategy, we are keen to see the development of a dedicated pathway for breast cancer gene, BRCA, positive patients and an audited quality-assured screening programme for them.  More capacity needs to be created in downstream services so that a dedicated group of physicians can follow these patients and discuss options and psycho-oncology support.  Patients have told us that the lack of capacity is illustrated by the fact that if they choose to have risk-reducing surgery, some women cannot be given a date for when reconstruction can happen.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, great cancer care is intertwined with cancer research.  Research is the driving force for ongoing improvement in cancer outcomes and motivates hope among patients and the world-class experts who give them care in this country.  Yet, the metrics suggest that research activity is significantly declining rather than growing.  Some of the issues I have illustrated are related to a lack of investment in capital infrastructure and service development.  Equally, the challenges associated with the cancer workforce are a significant threat to the success of the national cancer strategy.  The implementation of many recommendations is wholly reliant on having enough staff with the right skills and access to the best equipment to deliver cancer services.  Healthcare professionals underpin the success of the entire strategy.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Cancer Society believes that there has never been a more urgent time to focus on cancer services.  We are grateful for the funding injection into cancer services that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, announced as part of budget 2021.  We believe it will be one element of the many that are needed to build a strong and resilient cancer service.<\/p> <p>  I thank committee members for remaining focused on the performance of cancer services and for acknowledging the major challenges that have built up over a considerable period.  Committee members have refocused political attention so that cancer does not become the forgotten C during the pandemic.  Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on all of our lives.  When it comes to cancer, however, it is the things we do today and the measures we put in place here and now that will decide the ultimate impact of this pandemic on our cancer outcomes.<\/p><p>I said we are in the business of hope.  Together all stakeholders - patients, healthcare professionals, representative groups, members of Government and Members of the Oireachtas - need to turn hope into action.  We do this by demanding improvements, listening to and learning from experts, putting in place best practice and making sure we have efficient, well-funded and well-staffed cancer services.  I firmly believe that everyone here today can play a role in achieving that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#A01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Morrogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to meet with it to discuss cancer care and screening services.  I have been the director of the national cancer control programme since the end of July 2020.  I will begin by discussing the effect of Covid-19 on the symptomatic cancer services and then outline some future developments.<\/p> <p>  In common within many other countries, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on cancer services in Ireland.  The maintenance of cancer services during the pandemic has been prioritised by the HSE, the Department of Health and the Government.  Early in the pandemic, the national cancer control programme, NCCP, led a co-ordinated response on behalf of the cancer services.  Close engagement between clinicians from key disciplines addressing difficult clinical questions and facilitating the urgent need for the development of national guidelines helped to deliver safe services and maximise survival in an extremely uncertain environment.  Communication with primary and community care and with the public at large was prioritised to ensure clear messaging on the availability of safe cancer services.  <\/p> <p>  As Ms Morrogh mentioned, this has been a very difficult period for cancer patients and their families.  To mitigate the risk to their care in a Covid environment, the cancer services have enabled as much care as possible to take place outside the acute hospital setting while ensuring robust infection prevention and control measures are in place to ensure patient safety within the hospital setting.  The NCCP, the Irish Cancer Society and Cancer Care West established a virtual psych-oncology service called Together 4 Cancer Concern to address the real problem of anxiety and worry facing many cancer patients.  The Department of Health funded 26 acute oncology nurses to help ensure those patients on cancer treatment avoided emergency departments and stayed outside hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic required adapting diagnostic and treatment pathways to ensure patient and staff safety.  The impact of these measures has unavoidably reduced capacity.  However, staff in the cancer services have responded with great dedication and agility and have adopted measures to optimise triage, pre-screen patients, utilise telemedicine, make local infrastructural changes, alter locations of diagnosis or treatment and increase capacity using extended days and additional weekend clinics.  I sincerely thank all the staff for their unstinting efforts on behalf of cancer patients during what was a very challenging time in the health services.<\/p> <p>  We are continuing to optimise capacity in the cancer services in a safe manner and would encourage people with symptoms suspicious of cancer to consult their GP so they can be referred for appropriate investigation.  During the initial pandemic wave, there was a reduction in cancer presentations and referrals; in attendances at rapid access clinics for breast, lung and prostate cancers; and in the number of patients undergoing treatment.  Reduced cancer presentations were likely related to an understandable fear with regard to Covid infection and a response to the restrictions in place at that time.  Since then there has been a gradual recovery in all metrics, a recovery which has continued despite the second autumn pandemic wave.  There was a decrease in the number of cancers diagnosed at the rapid access clinics during the first wave.  There has, however, been an increase since then and at the end of September, the year to date number of primary cancers diagnosed at these clinics was approximately 90% compared to 2019.  It is expected that this percentage figure will continue to increase for the remainder of the year with a consequent reduction in the number of \"lost cancer diagnoses\".<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Health has allocated a total of &euro;34.35 million to the NCCP in the winter pandemic plan and the national service plan for 2021.  This is a marked increase in funding compared to recent years and is greatly welcomed by all in the cancer services.  The funding will be used in two key areas: increasing resilience in the current cancer services; and progressing key elements of the cancer strategy.<\/p> <p>  Experience during the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of welcome new initiatives in the cancer services that will require further consolidation.  These include the increasing use of ICT in the delivery of care and the optimisation of diagnostic and treatment pathways to reduce footfall in the acute hospital setting.  Increasing clinic efficiencies using various streamed pathways for patient care will be progressed.  Staffing resilience will be improved through additional recruitment and optimising skill mix.  It must be noted, however, that the greatest threat to resilience in the cancer services in the short to medium term is increased community transmission of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  With regard to progressing cancer strategy 2017-2026, the priorities for 2021 will include the progression of cancer prevention initiatives; improved access to diagnostics for all cancer patients; addressing the increasing and more complex demand for radiation oncology, including the provision of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy; further centralisation of cancer surgery to ensure safe, quality care for patients; enhancing medical oncology services to meet the growing complexity and demand; development of appropriate models of care for rare cancers; further development of the cancer genetics and molecular diagnostic services and improved services in the hereditary cancer programme; continued development of survivorship services, including psycho-oncology services, to improve the quality of life of those living with and beyond cancer; and supporting a research culture in the cancer services, including promoting clinical and academic collaboration.<\/p> <p>  In summary, Covid-19 has posed significant challenges to cancer services in 2020, particularly during the first pandemic wave, with a significant increase in activity since then.  The recent significantly increased funding for cancer services will allow us to increase resilience in the current services while progressing key cancer strategy priorities in 2021.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Riste&aacute;rd &Oacute; Laoide"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems throughout the world in a way that was inconceivable this time last year.  In March, when we knew very little about Covid, screening services internationally played their part by pausing their programmes in order to prevent infection based on best public health advice.  Since then, we have assessed the risks of delivering screening in a Covid environment and have put in place measures to reduce these risks.<\/p> <p>  In restarting cervical screening, we are focused on managing capacity across the whole screening pathway so that people get their results and any follow-up assessment in a timely manner.  CervicalCheck resumed screening on 6 July by prioritising inviting the longest waiters to reduce the risk of the people delayed.  By the end of December 2020, we will have issued a first invite letter to everyone due screening in 2020.  We issued more than 270,000 invites in 2020 and screened more than 117,000 people in primary care.<\/p> <p>  While the global demand for Covid-19 testing has put pressure on laboratory supplies internationally, our laboratory is continuing to meet our capacity needs.  For women, this translates into approximately 80% of result letters being issued within six weeks of the test.  We continue to appeal for people to book their test when invited.<\/p> <p>  We have been asked how the pressures of the global pandemic will affect the people we care for in screening.  These concerns are also our concerns.  While we continue to work to minimise the impact of Covid-19 on screening, evidence shows that because of the typically slow progression of cervical cancer - over five to 15 years - the beneficial outcomes do not reduce if screening is delayed for six months.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of screening is to improve population outcomes for the condition being screened for.  In CervicalCheck, that is decreasing the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer.  We do this by assessing risk in individuals and referring those with a higher than normal risk for further assessment in colposcopy.  All screening programmes involve finding a balance between their benefits and potential harm.  Our rigorous quality assurance systems ensure the programme meets the highest international standards and keeps risks as low as is possible.  <\/p> <p>  Our new primary HPV screening programme will lead to a temporary increase in referrals to colposcopy in year two.  We have investment in place to grow our colposcopy provision.  However, we must also work with the HSE national women and infants programme to ensure capacity is created in the gynaecology service for women with symptoms who may previously but erroneously have been sent to colposcopy for quicker access to gynaecology services.<\/p><p>We are concerned when we hear people from all walks of life confuse screening services with diagnostic services, and we welcome the opportunity to talk to the committee about this today.<\/p><p> In March of this year, the HPV test was introduced as the primary cervical screening method. It brought CervicalCheck in line with international best practice in cervical screening.  With HPV screening we are testing for a different risk factor in the development of cervical cancer: the presence of the human papillomavirus, that is, HPV.<\/p><p> We know that HPV screening is better at predicting which women are at risk of developing cancer but it will not detect everyone.  No screening programme will pick up all potential cancer cases; none is designed to do so.  When a potential case of cancer is not detected in screening, this does not mean that the screening test has failed.  It illustrates the boundaries of the test.  Furthermore, when these women go on to get cancer and their cytology slides are reviewed retrospectively, there is a four in ten chance that abnormalities will be seen that were not seen at the time of screening.  This is called retrospective bias.  It is important that as a society we acknowledge this uncomfortable truth.<\/p><p> The National Cancer Screening Laboratory, NCSL, build will begin in January 2021.  In time, it will become the principal provider of cervical screening laboratory services.  For now, a high-quality laboratory service continues to be delivered by Quest Laboratories in the US.<\/p><p> We are grateful that GPs and practice nurses are continuing to fulfil their important role as key sample takers for CervicalCheck.  We thank our colposcopy colleagues who, during the pause in screening, continued to work hard to reduce the waiting list that had resulted from the issues affecting CervicalCheck in 2018.  Our colposcopy turnaround times are continuing on target.<\/p><p> In October, the National Screening Service, NSS, welcomed the publication of the expert reference groups&rsquo; interval cancer reports.  These reports were commissioned as part of the Scally review in 2018 and their publication marks the completion of 113 of the 116 Scally report actions.  The reports acknowledged that Ireland&rsquo;s cancer screening programmes operate to the highest international standards.  They emphasise, however, that every year there will be people who develop interval cancers.  This is a difficult diagnosis for people to receive.  We are now working to implement those recommendations in full.  We plan to consult widely with patients and their doctors about the future process.  Finally, we are grateful to the many patient representatives who voluntarily give up their time to support our screening programmes this year at an especially difficult time.  We remain committed to having patients at the centre of our screening programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Russell.

Regarding the capacity to deal with increased referrals, will we have a sufficient number of people with the expertise to deal with it?

I will start by addressing his first point about capacity in colposcopy.  Year two of the programme will commence in the middle of next year so from June onwards in 2021.  We are delighted to have secured &euro;2 million in extra funding for colposcopy services for 2021.<\/p> <p>  One of the key points we are planning for closely with the national women and infants programme is to ensure we increase capacity in gynaecology services.  Currently, one third of women who are referred into colposcopy clinics are referred in because of symptoms.  Those women would be more appropriately and holistically assessed if they attended rapid access gynaecology clinics under the care of the national women and infants programme.  That would free up capacity in the colposcopy clinics to look after women who screen positive and need further investigation. <\/p> <p>  As I said, we are delighted to have received funding and we are working collaboratively because it is actually a small community in Ireland who have the necessary skills to provide colposcopy.  We need to ensure we match the capacity of women's needs and make sure we have the appropriate healthcare professionals to see them.  It is, however, absolutely key that women who have symptoms, first, do not delay presenting to their GP.  They must be seen urgently and assessed and the GPs and primary care specialists must have an avenue of rapid access to gynaecology clinics for women with symptoms.

As he said, 26 cancer nurses were employed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  These were employed specifically to ensure patients avoided the emergency department in what was an uncertain environment in the hospitals.  They have proven exceedingly valuable because they work with the patients in the community and liaise with the GP, and really, direct patients away from the hospital and deal with any acute problems that arise from them.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, we have received a significant amount of funding this year, as I outlined in my opening statement.  That will allow us to plan for additional posts in the systemic anti-cancer therapy section of the NCCP.  We are hoping a further 40 positions will be recruited in 2021 to allow us to increase our staffing, which would be an overall increase of approximately 66 staff.

Some local deviation takes place because one of the main issues for capacity at the moment is transmission of Covid-19.

Medical diagnostics and genomic medicines are critical in the modern delivery of cancer care.  Medical diagnostics are important because they identify somatic mutations in tumours and biomarkers, which predict a response to drugs.  This is commonly known as precision oncology and is routinely incorporated into clinical decision-making.  The majority of newly approved cancer drugs are required to be accompanied by a comparison molecular diagnostic test.<\/p> <p>  The cancer strategy suggested we put in place a national implementation framework for molecular diagnostic testing so it is provided in a co-ordinated and standardised way.  To date, the investment has not been put in place for molecular diagnostics, although we in the NCCP have set up a framework to look at molecular diagnostics as it relates to drugs and the provision of drugs, where the test is important in deciding whether the drugs should be given to a patient.  Some of this testing is currently done in Beaumont Hospital and St. James's Hospital but there are a number of other centres doing molecular diagnostic testing.  The NCCP is focused on putting a framework in place so we have a network which optimises the provision of these molecular diagnostics because they change quickly.  Five years ago, a patient would go for one molecular diagnostic test, while now there are panels of 50 such tests being performed in some departments.<\/p><p>It is important that we put a framework in place for molecular diagnostics.

Some of the chemotherapy and day care wards were transferred in total to the private institutions.  For example, St. Vincent's University Hospital went to St. Vincent's Private Hospital and University Hospital Waterford went to UPMC Whitfield, and there are a number of other examples.  A significant amount of day care oncology activity was transferred for the safety of patients because, in the environment at that time, a risk of Covid was a significant concern to us.  Where the day care units were not sufficiently separated in the hospitals, they were transferred to the private sector.<\/p> <p>  The second area was in surgical oncology.  Again, because at the time there was a significant concern and we had seen what had happened in northern Italy, a lot of the theatre capacity and the ICU capacity was being kept for Covid patients and the potential Covid wave we were expecting.  A lot of the surgical oncology was sent out to the private sector.  Different hospitals went to different private sector locations.<\/p> <p>  They were the two main areas that went out.  Since then, most of the surgical oncology has returned to the public hospitals.  This is what the national cancer control programme wants.  We have spent a lot of time in the past pushing centralisation because of its importance for patient care and patient outcomes.  The idea that we would be involved in an element of decentralisation by sending out surgical oncology was a concern to us.  Occasionally, however, there are patients who still go out for surgical oncology.<\/p><p>For example, some patients from St. James's Hospital are going to the Beacon Clinic for oesophageal surgery at the moment.  That depends on whether there is a stress on the system within the hospital, secondary to Covid, at that time.<\/p><p> Most of the day-care units have come back to the public hospitals now.  The exceptions include the Waterford unit, which is remaining in UPMC Whitfield Hospital, the Wexford unit is in Ely Hospital, and the Kilkenny unit is still in Aut Even Hospital Kilkenny.  The reason for that is capacity in the public hospitals and their ability to deal safely with a vulnerable group of patients.<\/p><p> There is also a framework in place for the private hospitals as part of the winter and pandemic plans.

There are challenges within our system in that we have rapid access to clinics for more common cancers but those pathways do not exist for rare and less common cancers.  There are challenges to find ways to ensure we pick up the early signs and symptoms in patients who can present to general practice and diagnostic services earlier and quicker to ensure these patients can be diagnosed at an earlier stage and have a better chance of successful treatment.  One of the recommendations in the national cancer strategy is that numbers presenting in emergency departments be reduced over the ten-year period of the strategy.  We need to see progress on that.

Young people have been bombarded with public health messages about Covid, for example, they are told not to go near people.  I am worried that not many women availed of the offer to engage with cervical screening services when they resumed recently.  A former Minister for Health expressed a hope that human papillomavirus or HPV would be eliminated in the coming years.  When young people do not engage with screening services to the greatest extent possible it is a major public health issue.  I engage with many young people and I am concerned that there is still a stigma among a lot of young women in their mid-20s about smear tests.  They believe they are too young to worry about screening or choose to wait because their lives are too busy.  What steps are being taken to encourage young people, particularly young women, to get tested?<\/p> <p>  A recent survey by the Irish Cancer Society found that approximately one in four respondents did not attend a GP or a hospital appointment when it was necessary.  Of those who did not attend, three in ten decided to wait because they did not believe the issue was sufficiently serious.  Further, one in four respondents did not attend because they were afraid of catching Covid-19 and 23% did not want to bother their GPs.  All of those are terribly Irish reasons not to attend.  Has Covid-19 affected people's perception of whether they need to attend a doctor?  We want early intervention to catch illnesses, particularly cancers, at a very early stage so the prognosis is better.  As public representatives, we can encourage people to seek help.

I will respond on the messaging about HPV and what we did when the programme changed last March.  We had a full campaign that had been worked up and was ready to go.  We were ready to launch our new improved cervical screening programme, moving from a cytology-based service to primary HPV, but it coincided with the Covid pandemic.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, there was a great deal of messaging at the time.  We decided, therefore, not to launch our full campaign in March.  As such, while we changed the programme, we are behind in the messaging about HPV.<\/p> <p>  Since we restarted on 6 July, we have been running a campaign to inform women about the new primary HPV programme.  We have had significant uptake in recent months.  November was a bumper month for the cervical screening programme.  We expected to screen 21,000 women but 24,000 women attended for screening.  The Senator is right.  Initially, we were worried that women would not respond to their invitations to attend cervical screening but women are attending in huge numbers and we are delighted with that.  Again, that is thanks to the screeners, GPs and practice nurses who carry out these screening tests for us.  We have that engagement.  Our public health awareness programme, which involves media campaigns and advertisements, is up and running.  We plan to do more of that in the future. <\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question about young women, she is correct in this regard.  We know that 25-year-olds have a lot going on in their lives and their first screening test is not always top of their priority list.  Our communications team is working on that engagement.  We are also working on our website as younger women engage with messaging differently from older women.  We are always looking for new ways to engage with younger women about the programme so we would be delighted to consider any suggestions the Senator may have.<\/p> <p>  As to whether there has been a change in how people react to healthcare, there has been an incredible amount of fear over the last year.  We have seen that with all healthcare services across the world so it is not just an Irish issue.  People were terrified to go into healthcare settings because of the risk of catching Covid-19.  We know a lot more now than we did in March and we are a lot clearer about how to reduce the risk.  What we are seeing now is people re-engaging with healthcare.

When we speak about screening programmes, and I will speak specifically to CervicalCheck, we know that when we screen 1,000 women, within them there would be 20 women with a risk factor for developing cervical cancer, and screening with cytology or smear tests would detect 15 from those 20, or 75% of women with that risk factor.  Screening with primary HPV will detect 18 from 20 women with that risk factor or 90%.  There is no screening test for cervical cancer that detects all women at risk.  There will always be women with a screening test that is negative but who will go on to develop a cancer.<\/p> <p>  As a clinician, I have been in the room with such women and it is devastating to receive that diagnosis.  These are women who have done everything right, gone for their screening test and followed up where asked but who still went on to get cancer.  That is a really hard diagnosis to get.  We know from international literature and the reviews of the CervicalCheck programme that when we look back on the slides for women who were screened and go on to develop cancer, there is a four in ten chance we would see a different result looking back than was seen at the time of screening.  That is the reality of what a review is likely to reveal.  That is retrospective bias.

It is appreciated.  Before I ask my questions, I will add my voice to urge and encourage women to use the CervicalCheck cancer screening.  Despite all the media reports and questions around it, the programme plays a valuable role in protecting women's lives.<\/p> <p>  I recently received a reply to a parliamentary question which showed that 231 legal cases related to CervicalCheck have been launched in recent times.  That is shocking in many ways.  The T&aacute;naiste told us that women would not have to go through the court system to achieve justice in this regard and we have been long promised a tribunal to deal with this matter but it is still not in place.  The Government stated that women had been wronged and rightly apologised for that.  The courts have also stated that women had been wronged.  A long list of doctors have stated that certain slides were misread.  There were flashing red lights that should have been seen when those slides were read in the first instance, but that did not happen.  While I agree with the clinical director of CervicalCheck that there is always a significant margin of error in screening and that is part of the process, there is a Government policy and a court decision that notes that there have also been difficulties outside of that margin of error, as such.<\/p> <p>  I received a letter from CervicalCheck in the past couple of weeks and had a conversation with its clinical director.  I was taken by surprise that CervicalCheck seems to have a different view on this from the Government and the courts and it does not believe that women have been wronged and that the courts have adjudicated correctly.  I am worried about that because it has an effect on the women who have gone through the system and received an apology.  I am also concerned about other problems that we may find within society.  There may be other women, outside the normal margin of error, who had their slides misread and are currently asymptomatic.  If we carried out a sample reading look-back on those slides, we might be able to ensure that lives are protected and people get diagnoses and receive treatment faster.  The reason I came to this view was as a result of the very sad case of Ms Patricia Carrick, God rest her.  She did not have cancer at the time of a look-back so her case was not read.  I will perhaps ask the clinical director of CervicalCheck if there is not a danger here if different elements of the State have radically different opinions on the matter.  Does that difference of opinion not make it difficult for us then to ensure that we proceed with a look-back on other samples?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#K00800","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  It is nice to chat to him about these things again.  I think he and I had a productive conversation last week where we agreed that we have a common goal of rebuilding trust in our world-class screening programme.  I have been a doctor on the front line and given that information to a woman who has been screened and goes on to get a cancer diagnosis.  We all agree that it is a challenging and difficult place to be, as a woman, and it is worse still if that woman believes that somebody did not do their job right and that is why she is getting this diagnosis.  However, as a clinician, I can tell the committee that a smear screening test will never detect all cancers.  Every year, on the CervicalCheck programme, there will be women who have an interval cancer, meaning they will develop cancer after a normal screening test.<\/p><p>That is a reality.  It will happen next year and it is happening this year, because screening will never detect all cancers.  Internationally, few countries carry out reviews.  When Public Health England reviewed slides for women who got cancer, four in ten women had an abnormality detected on look-back that was not seen on review.  What we have found is very helpful is the Supreme Court ruling, which clarified that absolute confidence does not mean 100% detection.  That is really important.  The Supreme Court clarified that a new standard has not been introduced and that screening tests are not expected to detect 100% of cancers because, of course, that is impossible.  The court also outlined in great detail the reasons a competent screener could be doing his or her job to the best of his or her ability with the tools he or she has, and a cancer may still not be detected.  That was outlined in great detail in the Supreme Court and it is very welcome for cancer screening services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Russell for that answer but it does not get to the key issue.

The fact remains that no cervical screening programme in the world detects 100% of cervical cancers.  There are interval cancers in every cervical cancer screening programme in the world.  That is a straightforward fact.  I am delighted the Deputy is raising these questions because they are questions for broader Irish society.  Do we accept as a society that we continue with screening because, for the majority, it reduces the risk of developing cancer?  If we do that, we have to acknowledge there will be women who are screened for cervical cancer, have a negative result and go on to get cancer.  That is the minority, but it is really tough for a woman if she ends up in that minority.  We as a society have to decide how we look after women in that minority.<\/p> <p>  We also have to decide whether we will treat some people with cancer differently from others.  Every year, as we have heard from Ms Morrogh, 24,000 people in Ireland are diagnosed with cancer.  The majority of these people, approximately 22,600, are diagnosed with cancer when they get symptoms.  Some 1,400 people are diagnosed with cancer on a screening programme.

The State has acknowledged there is another section of women, outside of the margin of error, whose cases should have been picked up.  The reason I raise this issue is that some of those women will not have a look-back until they are diagnosed with cancer, such as Patricia Carrick.  For those women, it may be too late to carry out the necessary treatment to protect their lives.  I suggested we would take a sample of those asymptomatic women and determine whether there are mistaken readings.  \"Missed opportunities\", \"mistaken readings\", \"red lights\": these are not my words but those of the doctors who have given evidence in court cases relating to the matter.

The Deputy's question about whether we should perform a review of all the women who have received a normal result is the exact same thing as screening, and screening will never find all the women with cancer.  The same test can be performed over and over again, and the women can be screened and rescreened, but it takes away valuable resources from screening the women who were due to be screened to look back and rescreen women who have been screened.  One will never find and predict all the women in that cohort who will go on to develop cancer.

However, a major issue and controversy arose in respect of a look-back.  In the case of a considerable number of look-backs, it was determined in the courts and elsewhere that the existence of cancer should have been identified in the first instance.  It was not that it was identified but that it should have been.  I realise that is a very difficult conclusion to come to, from a diagnostics point of view, but the courts came to that decision and medical evidence was adduced in court to the effect that on the look-back, there was evidence that cancer should have been recognised but that it was not recognised.<\/p> <p>  The other issue was that the patients in many cases were not informed.

A number of those cases, I imagine and hope, will go through the CervicalCheck tribunal, which started on 1 December, and people have started to put those claims through.  It will be very useful for all of us to see the outcome of the tribunal and the results that come through.  To date, relatively few cases have gone to court.  Some have been settled before they went there.  It is always the State Claims Agency's intention to use mediation to prevent people having to go to court if they can, although a few tragic cases have gone through the High Court and had their evidence assessed.  There is not a medical intervention known to us that has not on occasion been found to be negligent, but they are very small numbers.  We do not anticipate that all 230 cases that are going through now will show evidence of negligence.  As Dr. Russell outlined, the unfortunate reality of a test that is not perfect is much better now, thank goodness.  Even at that, however, interval cancers will continue to come through in future.  Our concern is how we try to avoid people going to court in future.  Patients rightly say they hate it and doctors do not like it either.<\/p><p>We have to find some other way of thinking about and addressing the issue that we will continue to have interval cancers.  One of the good things about screening is that we repeat it regularly.  In the case of cervical screening, for example, anyone who tests positive now for HPV will come back for another test a year later and then go on to have cytology.  We call people back on a two-, three- or five-year schedule, depending on their risk levels, so the chance is always there that if the cancer is not picked up on the first screen, it might be picked up on the second.  Because these are generally slow-growing cancers, we will often pick up the cancer at a later point.  Over the course of the next cycle or round of screenings - in other words, from 2018 until now - all the women who were called previously will be called again this time.  Therefore, a patient's call for looking back at those will be done anyway because we will recall and look at everybody's screen.  If they come for screening, we will look at their tests again over this round.  Once this round is finished, we will start the next round.  We do repeat screening all the time, so I do not see a benefit in taking a further sample.  If we are talking about one or two per 1,000 who might have an abnormality that we have failed to pick up, there is a risk that either we will do that again in the subsequent screening, as Dr. Russell said, or that the numbers will be so small that they will be impossible to find, unless we repeat the entire round, which we are already doing.  Screening is a complicated system, but I hope we can offer some reassurance that by repeating and screening regularly we increase the chance of finding anything that perhaps was not found in a previous round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I wish to come in on just one point Deputy Durkan made.

I myself have been in that position, like Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, in that I have got that difficult information and was told I had cancer.  Can anything be done about this, bearing in mind we are dealing with a pandemic?  Is there anything that can soften that blow or is there some other way of giving that information?  I presume it is being given over the phone at present.  Are the witnesses looking at this?  Is there any way of doing it?<\/p> <p>  Second is the issue of the financial cost of cancer.  We have a drugs payment scheme, but for many of those who have had or who have cancer the difficulty is that they first have to reach that ceiling, but many of the things one might need are not covered by the scheme.  Perhaps the Irish Cancer Society representatives might talk about the real cost of not only the psychological and physical impact of cancer but also its financial impact.  Is there anything they feel they need to say about that?<\/p> <p>  Finally, it is usually around this time of year in November and December that we talk about men's health.  Are there any discussions ongoing in that regard?  We know that men, particularly men of a certain age, do not talk about their issues, but it is important that people go forward and get tested.  Is there any possibility of a screening programme, a proactive campaign, to get men in for screening, particularly for prostate cancer, although not solely for that?  That would be important.<\/p> <p>  Those few questions probably need to be addressed.  Before the witnesses come back in, I wish to thank all the staff they represent, particularly those in the HSE, for their dedication and commitment.  They turn up every day and have done so during the pandemic, often at great risk to themselves and their families.  It is important we as a committee say that and that we learn from mistakes.  One of the things I noticed during my time attending was that many of the appointments were at the same time.  I would get an appointment for 9.30 a.m. and another 40 people would turn up at the same time, or I would get an appointment for 2.30 p.m. and there would be another 40 people there.  Clearly, people have busy lives, but there must surely be ways of improving that.  We have learnt a lot from the pandemic about what we can and cannot do, and perhaps lessons can be learned from that.<\/p> <p>  I have asked a number of questions.  If I can, I will try to fit in one of my colleagues after the witnesses' responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#M00700","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>In the Irish Cancer Society one of the things we hear about regularly is the financial impact of cancer.  Cancer is not something for which one sets aside savings or puts financial supports in place to manage its cost.<\/p><p>One of the things we have heard is that people are not prepared for that cost, so in all of our pre-budget submissions we have asked the Government to step in and try to reduce current levies, such as car parking, inpatient charges and outpatient charges.  A reduction in these levies would make the lives of cancer patients much easier, so we encourage all members of the committee to do what they can to drive down those costs.<\/p><p> On the issue of those who have received their cancer diagnosis alone, or who have received some bad news in the last number of months, our support line, which is staffed by oncology nurses, has dealt with many calls from those feeling the loneliness that has permeated the Covid period.  We spoke earlier about fear, and cancer patients in particular have been very fearful about accessing healthcare and getting Covid, and it is likely that this fear has translated into them not seeking healthcare when they should.  It is important that we do everything we can to enable people to share those moments with those they love.  If anything, the pandemic has highlighted the human side and what is important to all of us is our health, our families and our friends.  It is important to remember those things.  Psychological support has been invaluable throughout Covid, and the Irish Cancer Society has stepped up in that respect.  We are pleased to partner with the NCCP and Cancer Care West in providing additional psychological supports for people, but these supports need to be provided to everyone and need to be woven into the cancer system so that they are available as a standardised model of care, and this has been approved by the NCCP.  That is going to require putting people into roles to provide this support, because having cancer is a very traumatic experience, both physically and psychologically.<\/p><p> With regard to men's health, like every other sector of society, we need targeted approaches to encourage people to access healthcare to make sure they get diagnosed as early as possible.  The supports required need to be put in place, and the Irish Cancer Society would very much like to partner with others in that area to ensure we can work together and get people into care as quickly as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Morrogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I would have liked the HSE to respond, but we just do not have the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I want to ask about the mobile breast cancer screening units that are in operation around the country.

As we start to - hopefully - emerge from Covid in the months ahead, I am wondering if there are plans to expand this service.  In particular, would the witnesses consider introducing a mobile screening service for testicular cancer and prostate cancer, and perhaps a mobile checking point for testing prostate specific antigen levels for the men in this country?  The mobile screening units have been hugely successful in more rural areas, where, unlike cities, people cannot go into physical clinics.

I think it works well around the country.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that the Deputy raised the issue of men's health services because there is a real message to send out to men around bowel cancer screening.  Currently our uptake for this service is approximately 50%, so half of the people who could come forward for quite a simple bowel check are not doing so.  It can be done in the comfort of one's own home, and it is a simple test to do and to send back.  The benefits of doing this test are enormous.  Over a ten-year period of screening, we anticipate that deaths from bowel cancer for those who come for screening will reduce by one third.  That is a huge number for a cancer that is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Ireland.  We will do anything we can to encourage people to come forward for bowel screening.  Over the course of the next five years our ambition will be to expand the number of people who can take up bowel screening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I apologise, but I must cut Ms Murphy off there, because we are way over our time limit, and there is a safety element to consider in respect of members of the committee and staff here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I would be happy to send a note of my response to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their engagement today.

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to address the committee on the topic of Covid-19 pandemic supports to the islands and rural Ireland.  Members will be aware that responsibility for the islands' function transferred from the former Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the Department of Community and Rural Development in September.   The offshore islands and their communities are, of course, a fundamental part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  Many of the challenges that affect the islands are similar to those in other parts of rural Ireland, but they are even more pronounced due to the islands&rsquo; separation from the mainland.  We hope the islands will benefit from the closer alignment with the Department&rsquo;s suite of programmes and initiatives to support community development, rural economic development and digital innovation.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed our society and economy in the space of just nine months.  The impact of Covid-19 was extreme and immediate.  It has affected the way we work, study, socialise and go about our daily business.  Rural economies are vulnerable to economic downturns at the best of times due to their less diversified economic base and a greater reliance on small and micro-enterprises compared with large urban centres.<\/p> <p>  A report on the regional impact of Covid-19 published in May by the three regional assemblies concluded that coastal and rural counties are more likely to be exposed to the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 due to their high reliance on enterprises that require human interaction or which cannot be operated remotely.  We know, too, that sectors such as tourism, hospitality, arts and culture, on which many rural towns, villages and communities depend, have been among those most impacted by Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The social impact of Covid-19 has also been highlighted by many commentators.  The dispersed settlement pattern of rural Ireland, along with its older demographic profile than urban areas, also creates a particular social vulnerability for many people living in rural areas.  The Covid crisis has also demonstrated the extraordinary efforts of local communities, organisations and volunteers in mobilising to help those most in need or at risk of social isolation.  Many of the positive aspects of rural living have been highlighted, including the quality of life, a sense of community and close access to countryside trails, forests and coastlines.  These have been important factors in supporting the physical and mental well-being of many people at this time.  The Western Development Commission reported recently that 7% of respondents to a survey on remote working had relocated to the west of Ireland since the start of the pandemic, while a further 23% were considering doing so.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, many different supports have been introduced across Departments to help businesses, individuals and communities to cope with the impact of Covid-19.  In general, these supports are available to those who run businesses or live in rural areas.  I would like, however, to focus today on the supports the Department of Rural and Community Development has made available to support businesses, social enterprises, communities and voluntary organisations to respond to the impact of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The Department was centrally involved from the outset of the pandemic in the Government&rsquo;s Community Call initiative, which mobilised national government, local government and the community and voluntary sector to support vulnerable people in our communities.  In March, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 action plan, the Department provided support for volunteering, funding to ALONE for its crisis telephone support line and funding for an email help-desk facility to assist smaller community groups with their queries.  In April, an initial &euro;2.5 million Covid-19 emergency fund was introduced to provide immediate and urgently-needed funding to community and voluntary groups participating in the Community Call.  This helped with practical supports such as food for meals on wheels services, care packs for people cocooning, personal protective equipment or PPE, and delivery van costs.  Just last Monday, the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, announced a further &euro;1.7 million under this fund to enable community and voluntary groups to support the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s Keep Well campaign and to adapt their services to the Covid situation.  The Department also provided funding for the Covid-19 community outreach scheme, to help ensure that any gaps in service to the vulnerable in each local authority area were identified and met.  This particular outreach scheme was operated by The Wheel and Irish Rural Link.<\/p> <p>  Community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises have played a huge role in responding to the Covid-19 crisis at local level.  Many were impacted, however, by the loss of revenue from traded income or fundraising as a result of restrictions put in place to counter the spread of the virus.  To help address this, in May the Government launched a &euro;40 million support package for these organisations.  The package is administered by the Department and funded through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  It includes a &euro;35 million Covid-19 stability fund that provides financial support to organisations and groups delivering front-line services to those most in need, but which were in danger of closure.  To date, close to 600 organisations, including a number of island-based organisations, have been allocated almost &euro;31 million under this fund.  An additional &euro;10 million was allocated to this fund in October and will be distributed shortly.<\/p> <p>  The stability package also included a &euro;5 million Government commitment to a philanthropy fund, Innovate Together, which focuses on supporting community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises to make innovative adaptations to their operations to address the challenges presented by the pandemic.  To date, 52 organisations have been allocated funding to a value of approximately &euro;3.2 million under the Innovate Together fund.  Just yesterday, a further &euro;1.3 million was announced to 20 organisations.  Rethink Ireland is the organisation that administers the scheme on behalf of the Department.<\/p> <p>  Apart for those community supports, the Department has adapted its rural development programmes this year to help rural areas and rural businesses to adapt to the impact of Covid-19.  This year&rsquo;s town and village renewal scheme included an accelerated measure designed to support rural towns and villages to put in place measures quickly to enable people to shop and socialise safely within the public health guidelines.  A total of 363 projects have been approved by the Minister under the accelerated measure, to a value of &euro;10.4 million.<\/p> <p>  The standard town and village renewal scheme that we have operated for the past number of years is placing an emphasis on supporting towns to adapt to the impact of Covid-19 in the medium term.  A budget of &euro;15 million is available for this measure and it is expected that the successful applicants will be announced in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was also refocused this year to help communities and organisations in CL&Aacute;R areas to adapt to Covid-19.  This year&rsquo;s programme included supports for community recreational areas, such as picnic spaces and seating areas, where people can socialise outdoors in safe, accessible community spaces.  It also provided support for the adaptation of vehicles and the purchase of kitchen or delivery equipment for community organisations providing meals on wheels and other community services.  A total of &euro;4.5 million has been approved under the CL&Aacute;R programme to date for 160 projects, with some additional funding to be announced by the Minister in the coming weeks.  The grant rate for these programmes was increased from 80% to 90% this year, in recognition of the pressures on the finances of local authorities and community groups due to the disruption caused by Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Other programmes such as the rural regeneration and development fund and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme will also play an important role in helping rural areas to recover from Covid-19 in the medium term.  The rural regeneration and development fund has been repositioned this year to ensure that the investment provided can act as a driver for economic recovery in the post-Covid environment.  The Department has also shown flexibility in other schemes such as LEADER, the community services programme, Tidy Towns and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, recognising the difficulties faced by delivering organisations.<\/p> <p>  Specific accommodation has been provided to facilitate island communities during the pandemic.  Approximately 30 of the offshore islands are inhabited, with populations varying from fewer than ten people to more than 800 people.  A large proportion of those living on the islands are in an older age group, with the majority of the islands having a high dependency ratio.  Passenger transport and cargo services to the islands are lifeline services.  Our overarching objective has been to keep these services open throughout the pandemic but to do so in a way which ensures the health and safety of the islanders, service providers and visitors.  In March, following requests from island representatives and in recognition of the unique challenges of island living, travel to the islands was closed to outside visitors.  This decision was taken in consultation with the island communities and was welcomed by them.  While visitors were not permitted to travel to the islands, the islanders themselves could continue to travel to and from the mainland to avail of services.<\/p><p>The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht arranged to prepay subsidies to operators in March to support their operations and to continue the lifeline services to the islands during the lockdown.  The Department also worked with community representatives and ferry operators to facilitate temporary reduced sailing timetables in an attempt to reduce the risk of exposure for the island communities and ferry operators. <\/p><p> In keeping with the general easing of restrictions, travel by visitors to and from the islands was permitted from July.  Since then, as the committee will be aware, the Government's Living with Covid-19 plan has set out various restrictions in regard to travel at different levels of the plan's framework.  The Department will work with the service operators to ensure that appropriate services to the islands continue to be provided at every stage of the framework. <\/p><p> Along with my colleague Ms de Br&uacute;ch, I will be happy to take any questions the members may have on supports provided by the Department to help rural communities to cope with the impact of Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Parnell.

There are many issues.  There are some attitudinal matters I would like to touch on.  First, I noticed that all the documentation that comes from the Department refers to rural towns and villages.  Here Mr. Parnell throws in communities.  Once again, I must stress that 30% of the people who live outside the towns and villages do not see themselves as they are envisaged.  They go to the town or village to shop or whatever but they regard themselves as being part of communities in their own right, particularly those involved in organisations such as the GAA.  Once again, it is important to stress that the vast majority in rural Ireland do not live in towns and villages.  That might seem a small point but it keeps coming up.  I was made very much aware of this last night.  I was talking to a public representative in the Houses who lives in a very rural area of a county adjacent to Dublin.  He told me that in the new county plan, the wishes of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications have come true at last.  There will be no houses built in rural parishes, even those that do not have overcrowded schools, unless the applicant is functionally dependent on the land.  I could count on two hands the number of houses that will be involved, even in the large county involved.  That is why I have to keep raising this issue.  An attack is being made on the rural Ireland we know.  A new rural Ireland is being created, and I am not sure it is one I want.  We have to keep highlighting that.  I certainly will do so.<\/p> <p>  Covid has been negative for everybody but I hate the b&eacute;al bocht.  I reckon that, for young and old alike, rural areas were the lucky places.  When one gets lucky, one should not always say one is unlucky and whinge.  From talking to my neighbours and friends all around Connemara, and to people on the islands, I noted the first point made was that the people have space.  When the pandemic began, we saw footage from Italy in which everybody was on top of one another in high-rise flats.  The residents could not get away from their neighbours.  If they wanted to socially isolate, it was very difficult.  The first thing we realised here is that we have the greatest gift.  We are all on half-acre sites, which give us space to ourselves.  If we wanted to keep the kids away from other kids when they were kept from school in the spring, it was much easier to do so on a half-acre site than on a street or in an apartment in the city.<\/p> <p>  Suddenly people woke up in the morning and smelled the coffee and said their circumstances were not bad compared to those seen in other places on the television.  Many people remarked that it was a brilliant spring.  Saint Patrick's Day was fierce but after that the weather improved.  People were walking, and those near the coast could get to the strand in five minutes.  I see this as a time in which the quiet revolution has started that will have the huge impact on the whole of society.  As pointed out, people are now moving out of the urban areas voluntarily.  They are not being forced out; they have suddenly realised that there is no actual need to be tied to a fixed office in the city all the time.  They are moving out to places they want to live in.  Nobody is forcing them to go there.  Many people went home for a few weeks during the lockdown because they could put the laptop up on the table and they were able to look out the window at God's nature.  It was easier to isolate socially.  We should, therefore, look at the positive side and say this could be the turning of the corner for rural regeneration and rebirth.  It could lead to more balanced populations in rural areas.  We should always see the glass as half full.<\/p> <p>  I keep hearing about rural isolation.  Isolation is a major issue but in many cases it is worse in the cities because it is easier to become socially isolated in a city, particularly, funnily enough, in middle-class parts, whose populations tend to be more transient because people move to different areas from generation to generation.  In looking at the effect of Covid, we should remember that Willie Bermingham, who founded ALONE, did not start out the country.  We must acknowledge that while social isolation is a major issue everywhere, the social capital out the country is really good, certainly in my parish.  The minute Covid started, the local organisations, without any help from the State, made sure that every older person had his or her shopping done and delivered to the door.  Communities got together to minimise the number of people going to the shops.  Rather than having five families go to the shop, thereby creating a risk, a family could order what it wanted by telephone, have it delivered and pay the bill at the end of the week.  We need to be positive and stop doing the b&eacute;al bocht.<\/p> <p>  I recall having this debate years ago with a Deputy in the House.  I said that if rural Ireland was as bad as he was saying, he should shift all the people out of it.  I said I did not believe his argument.  I would not live in the city.  I chose to live in the country because I believe the quality of life is way better there.  There narrative we hear all the time makes it sound as if we were all on our uppers and lacking services.  We definitely need better things but, in the round, rural living has great advantages.  We need to get positive about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#C00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":567,"content":"<p>The Deputy's comments are very helpful.  The Department and Minister fully subscribe to the view that rural Ireland is positive and dynamic.  The Minister has spoken about the contribution rural economies and communities make to our national well-being and development.  Indeed, she has spoken about the need to change the narrative on rural Ireland and also about the interdependency of rural and urban areas.  I assure the Deputy, in respect of his points on rural Ireland, that it is not just about towns and villages.  We are very much aware of that.  The rural regeneration and development fund, of which the Deputy will be aware, amounts to &euro;1 billion, is not just for towns and villages; it is also for the areas outside them.  There is no doubting, however, that towns and villages do act as hubs for economic activity and social engagement.  That is why there is a focus on trying to support towns and their rejuvenation as places for people to shop, visit, socialise and live.<\/p> <p>  On isolation, the Deputy is quite correct that it is not just a rural issue.  It is a societal issue regardless of whether those affected are living in a rural area or an urban one.

My first question concerns the report from the Western Development Commission.  We are all well aware that people have moved west, sometimes back to where they grew up, since Covid hit and they have been able to work remotely, which has been great and positive.  If there is to be an increase in the population in rural areas, such as Roscommon, Galway, Sligo and Leitrim, will there be a sustained examination of their development?  For decades there has not been a move to rural areas like that which has happened since Covid hit.  Where populations increase, we should examine to a greater extent the infrastructure and the services that can be provided to follow those people.<\/p> <p>  The European Regional Development Fund is particularly important for the northern and western region.  The witnesses will be aware that as a region in transition, we will have really good co-financing from Europe, at 60:40, which is excellent.  What level of engagement does the Department have with the regional assemblies?  I refer in particular to the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.  From 2021 to 2027, we need to take full advantage of those co-financing rates to ensure that we will improve and move back from being a region in transition to being a developed region.  The fund will be crucial in doing that.  Whether for infrastructure, education or whatever else, we should take full advantage of everything we can use it for.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the briefing material they provided in respect of the islands.  The funding for the Irish Islands Federation is welcome.  It has highlighted housing as the number one issue for the islands, and particularly their levels of housing stock.  I visited Arranmore a few weeks ago when it was safe to travel there.  The number one issue on the island was that people were coming home but there was nowhere for them to live.  There were a number of vacant properties but there was not funding to renovate them.  I appreciate that this is a housing matter, but because it is a big issue on the islands, I would like to see the Department working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in regard to it.<\/p> <p>  The briefing document referred to water on the Aran Islands.  There is a wider issue with water.  Restrictions are almost continuous during the summer if there is a drought.  On Inisheer, there were issues in May, when the water was being turned off at 5 p.m. and the last boat every day arrived at 7 p.m.  People were constantly being told to wash their hands, yet they had no water.  Those issues relating to drought have been allowed to continue every summer.  Water restrictions need to be sorted out and fixed because they should not happen in the midst of a global pandemic.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of broadband for the islands, Arranmore has a really good remote working hub, which people are using all the time.  I know that the Department is doing work on providing remote working hubs for rural areas, but are they being considered for the islands in particular, as well as the broadband connection points?  Will that be considered beyond Arranmore?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#D00100","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":569,"content":"<p>The Deputy spoke about the population increase and what needs to happen throughout the regions to meet the targets in the national planning framework.  Initiatives such as remote working will help to attract people but also, importantly, to retain them in rural areas.  Young people will always want to travel and move to new pastures but, equally, many would like to be able to come back or to remain in rural areas.  As we roll out broadband connection points and remote working hubs, it presents an opportunity to change the complexion of rural Ireland and to help to support population retention or population increase.<\/p> <p>  The Department has been to the fore in leading the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC, initiative, which seeks to attract investment, create jobs and improve quality of life for the region from Kerry to Donegal.  The Western Development Commission is the co-ordinating agency for the AEC initiative.  The initiative is very important because it covers whole-region investment to try to attract foreign direct investment or indigenous enterprise to invest in the region, and it has met with some success.  The remote working hub network project is being driven by the AEC initiative.  We work closely with the Northern and Western Regional Assembly in respect of the AEC initiative and it has been very supportive and good at inputting to the initiative.  The Deputy asked about the opportunity that will come from the European Regional Development Fund.  We will work closely with the Northern and Western Regional Assembly and the Southern Regional Assembly in respect of the Atlantic economic corridor to cover those counties that are further south.

Water, certainly, is one of the major issues that has arisen on the Aran Islands, as is housing, which is not an issue on every island but is on many, whether in respect of planning permission or social housing.  Each of the islands is very different and they all have their individual personalities, if we can call them that.<\/p> <p>  The Department is not directly responsible for the water or housing issues but, as part of the development of the policy, we are about to engage in a series of bilateral meetings with the line Departments responsible for these issues.

I very much welcome the Department's input in the response to Covid-19 and to the challenges that Covid-19 has posed for rural communities throughout the country, and the central role the Department has played in the Community Call to roll out a stability package for communities.  The accelerated measures under the town and village renewal scheme were very welcome, as was the CL&Aacute;R programme.

It is a wonderful day.  It is a joint effort by Clare County Council and the Michael Cusack Centre.  It will offer broadband connectivity to that rural part of County Clare.  It was brought to my attention that there is a position in that centre for a caretaker.  The previous caretaker, who would have been employed under the community services programme, has retired.  Because the community services programme is currently being reviewed, there is a state of flux in that regard and the position has not been filled, and there is no indication that it will be filled.  I have corresponded with the Department on the matter.  Other public representatives and I have been contacted by the Michael Cusack Centre.  Perhaps it is unfair to throw it out to the officials here but maybe they could follow up on that.  This issue arose during Covid and it is unresolved.  The broadband connection at the centre today should be a good news story, and it is being opened formally by the chief executive of Clare County Council, Mr. Pat Dowling.  It is important, however, that the funding would be made available to the centre so it can be run and marketed properly, and we can be proud of that centre in County Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#D00400","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":573,"content":"<p>On Deputy Carey's final point, I will certainly follow that up in the Department to see what the situation is.<br\/><br\/>On the wider subject of broadband connection points, BCPs, and remote working hubs, I said that I would come back to Deputy Kerrane with regard to the situation on the islands.  There are 13 BCPs that are either established on islands or are due to be established, which includes Valentia Island, which we know is connected via a bridge.  I can forward on a list of those islands.  Inisheer, Inishbofin, Inishmaan, Tory Island, Bere Island, Sherkin Island, and Inishturk and Clare Island in Mayo, also have BCPs, either <i>in situ<\/i>or due to be connected in the first quarter.<br\/><br\/>A lot of the BCPs are adapting now to provide remote working facilities.  We can certainly see that the BCPs have the potential to do a lot more than simply be hot-desk spaces.  My colleague Dr. Stjohn O'Connor was with the committee last week and he would have given a flavour of this.  The intention is to try to develop the facilities and services that can be available and be provided online at these centres including, for example, e-health initiatives and so on.<br\/><br\/>There is, of course, a much broader number of remote working hubs and digital hubs around the country.  The committee will also have heard from my colleague about this.  Some of these are privately owned, some are operated by social enterprises and some are public hubs.  Separate from the BCPs, there is a hub on Arranmore in County Donegal, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta plans to open a hub on Achill Island.  Again, while that is not an offshore island it gives the committee a sense of what is happening in that area.  It is important that we continue to develop these.  We are seeing the great interest in remote working, as the Deputy referred to, and there is an opportunity here to transform rural Ireland as the Minister, Deputy Humphreys has said.<br\/><br\/>I shall now return to Deputy Carey's question about the programmes and schemes for next year.  One of the things the Department prides itself on is that we can be flexible and adaptable, and we can change our programmes as the needs arise.  We are heading into 2021 keeping a very open mind on what is needed here.  Notwithstanding the vaccine, it is clear that it will take some time before we ever return that what is being called &quot;normal&quot; living.  We would also see the need for supports to help communities to help rural businesses to recover in a post-Covid-19 context.  There is a lot of work to be done to build up again the tourism and hospitality sector.  This is where programmes such as the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund can be very helpful in building again those assets that would help the medium-term and the longer-term recovery of rural areas, and I mean rural areas in the widest context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for coming to the committee today.  Water has been mentioned.  Is there any rainwater harvesting in the islands?  To me this would be a no-brainer because, as we know, the west gets tonnes of rain.  Cubic metres of water can be stored easily, which is 1,000 litres per cubic metre.  This can go a long way.  I have seen at first hand how it gets put into schools and halls.  I have not heard any mention yet of rainwater harvesting.  Such stored water could be there in emergency situations if water has run out.  Infrared technology can be used to kill off bacteria.  Is the Department looking into this as an option besides being dependent on a mains supply all the time?<\/p> <p>  There are a lot of great things happening but I have to say that I could spend all of my time trying to find all the things in order to let the community groups know about them.  I would love to know, for example, how the Department promotes these.  Is there a one-stop shop?  My time should not be spent doing PR and trying to connect the dots between supports and the community group and small businesses in rural areas.  I would love to know what is the best way to do that.  Is there a Department link or am I missing something?  Some community groups give out because they have not heard about a scheme that others did hear about.  I would like to have a fair and level playing field for all of them and I would like to know how we can do that better.  How does the Department advertise these?<\/p> <p>  I would also like to highlight the very important role that local markets play.  We have a very good local market in Rosslevan, near Ennis.  This has been a great social gathering for people where they can go to support local producers, growers and crafts people.  When they could not go to mass and when there were no shops open it was the only thing one could do to meet other humans.  We have very few of such markets.  I believe there are 126 of these markets out of 1,500 towns in Ireland.  From being involved in them in the past, I know that these markets can struggle to get proper supports from the local authorities or from the Government.  We really need to look at that.  For older people or for those who live alone, going to a market might not really be about buying the produce; it could be more about the social element.  There is an excellent market in Kinvara where they have live music but it has occurred to me that in my county we only have one regular farmers' market in the whole county.  There is something wrong with this and we need to look at them to give them more supports.  They need to be less complicated.  There was a market in Ennis but it got really complicated, whereby they wanted to charge the market &euro;20,000 if it wanted electricity.  The market has since found space in a private place that said they could have all the electricity in the world.  We are failing when it comes to local markets.  We have climate change and we have Brexit, we have social and mental health issues, and then there is rural isolation.  The Department needs to look more at supporting local markets, local growers and local gatherings, which are outdoors and safe.  I would like to hear the officials' views on this, and would like to work on this in the future with the Department.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke of the fact that it is hard to get planning permission in rural areas these days.  It is also hard to access all the empty houses in rural areas.  There are 48 in the village I am from, and I live in a two-pub, one-shop town.<\/p><p>Some of them are derelict while others are just empty, but there is something missing in that respect.  I know from travelling around north Clare and west Clare - we probably saw it everywhere - the amount of social housing as well as shops and town houses that are empty in most rural villages. Something drastic needs to be done about that, whether it is giving the owners a carrot, so to speak, to help them renovate and rent out the property, because there is a lack of places to rent in rural areas.  We need to look at the question of empty houses.  We do not always have to build new houses.  Let us look at the existing buildings and whether we can do more to encourage people to do them up or rent them out if they do not need them.<\/p><p> There are also many empty houses on the islands that family members may have built but they no longer live in them.  They may use them for Airbnb purposes but they are not available all year round.  We have issues with Airbnb around Lahinch and Ennistymon where houses are rented out for a few days when we have major issues with finding places to rent around north Clare.  I would like to see more done for the existing buildings that would bring life back into villages and towns.<\/p><p> It is important that we do not always overcentralise funding.  For example, there is a great group in Newmarket-on-Fergus which does meals on wheels.  They were hoping to expand that service.  They have been getting phone calls from all across the county to expand it.  I helped them with a pre-budget submission.  It went to a central rural development group nationwide but I worry that by the time that funding is drawn down, it might not happen as effectively as it would have with an existing group who know what needs to be done because they have been doing the work on the ground for years.  We need to watch out for that.<\/p><p> The community employment, CE, schemes were mentioned.  It is very important that we make them as inclusive as possible.  I continue to get phone calls from people who would love to join but they are not allowed either because they are too old or they have been means tested and, as their wife is a teacher or something like that, they cannot access it.  That is an important link, whether it is a CE scheme for three months, a year or whatever.  It would be welcome if we could look at that because it is a great social outlet for people in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#E00300","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  She raised quite a number of issues.  I will address some of them and then ask Ms de Br&uacute;ch to talk about the rainwater harvesting and any other issues relating to the islands.<br\/><br\/>The Senator asked how we promote our various schemes.  I appreciate that there are many schemes across Government.  Information on the schemes the Department operates is available on the Department's pages on the <i>gov.ie<\/i>website.  I appreciate that not everybody would necessarily have ready access to that information but most of these schemes are delivered through the local community development committees, LCDCs, of the local authorities.  The separate local development companies, which are often referred to as LEADER companies, are involved in the delivery of many of our schemes.  The local development companies are very active at community and local level so they should be in a position to provide information on any of the schemes operated by the Department or the Department of Social Protection.  That would include the likes of CE schemes.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the local markets, one of the lessons we have learned from the Covid-19 experience is the value of these outdoor markets, and not only in rural areas.  We have seen a local farmers' market close to my own home in Bushy Park.  There is no doubt that they bring a buzz and a bit of vitality to the area.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned in my opening address the accelerated measure under the town and village renewal scheme.  A number of projects have utilised funding to support the type of activity the Senator spoke about.  Donegal town has established an outdoor food market based on the funding from that accelerated measure.  In Ballyconnell, County Cavan, they have created an outdoor space for people to meet.  We have seen that in many different towns throughout the country.  Kildare town is a good example also of where they have converted the car parking space in the centre of town to make public seating and dining areas available.  That has enhanced those town centres.<br\/><br\/>The Senator mentioned empty buildings in towns.  That is an issue that has been raised on many occasions and it is one of the reasons we place a focus on supporting town revival and regeneration.  The Department ran a pilot scheme, which finished last year, to examine the whole issue of town centre living.  An independent report on that initiative was published in June of this year and it concluded that the issue of vacant properties is a complex one.  Sometimes, it is about people who have inherited a house and they do not know what to do with it or they do not have the resources to do anything with it.  In other cases it can be more costly to invest in the house than the return they will get on the investment.  More can be spent doing up a house than the eventual market value of a house in a town centre.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding that, the Senator will be aware that the programme for Government includes a commitment to a town centre first principle.  A colleague in the Department is co-chairing a group that has been established to look at progressing the town centre first principle.  As part of the work of that interdepartmental group, which includes a chief executive from Tipperary County Council, the group will examine the various recommendations made in the independent report on town centre living to see how they can be progressed.  It is an issue we are very conscious of as a Department and we will continue to work on it over the course of 2021.<br\/><br\/>I will hand over to Ms de Br&uacute;ch.

The Atlantic economic corridor is a broader concept.  It does not involve specific programmes.  The concept for it emerged from the chambers of commerce along the western region.  The idea was to develop a proposition of scale that would act as a counterbalance to the east coast.  It is really about connecting all the economic hubs along the western region, all the way from Kerry up to Donegal, in order that a cohesive and critical mass is created to attract investment.  For example, rather than Limerick trying to market itself as the place in which to invest and Galway separately trying to do the same, the idea was to create this critical mass of different centres that are all connected.  As for trade possibilities, the corridor has two universities and a number of institutes of technology.  The idea is to harness all the capital that is there, whether human capital or infrastructural assets, to attract people to live, work and invest along the corridor.  It is very much a high-level branding of the region, one might say, but it is supported by a number of practical projects, such as the creation of a network of connected remote working hubs.  The Western Development Commission has a role in helping the Department to co-ordinate all the different projects and initiatives taking place there.  One of the initiatives, for example, apart from the remote working hubs I have mentioned, was a submission to the European Commission on the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, corridor, putting forward the point of view of all the interested stakeholders along the western region.  It is very much a regional approach that is taken to co-ordination by the WDC rather than the WDC being a repository for individual projects.  As I said, the likes of the local development companies, the LEADER programme and the local enterprise offices would be the appropriate places to go to in order to find information on various schemes that might be available to support individual projects or ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Ms de Br&uacute;ch agus roimh Mr. Parnell.  I thank Mr. Parnell for his presentation.  I acknowledge the work the Department has done during this extraordinary pandemic.  I know that many of its staff have worked extremely hard.  There is also the significant amount of money that has come into the regions.  It is acknowledged by many communities, as is the assistance that has been given.<\/p> <p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I come from a rural area.  I live 2.5 miles out from the town of Strokestown, in Roscommon.  Many people in rural Ireland felt privileged when this pandemic arose that they were in a rural area, that we had the space and were not in crowded areas.  One evening my family was watching on TV something about an inner-city part of Dublin where there were a lot flats.  At the time there was virtually a total lockdown.  I heard a member of my family comment that the people in that area of Dublin did not have even a green area to play in and that we were there with acres of space and places to work.  This is a significant factor and points to the development of outdoor spaces, even though, obviously, at certain times of the year the weather is not conducive to being outdoors.  In my area a lot of walks and cycle routes are being put in place.  Open space will become so important because, as has been said, we will still be living with Covid for quite a while, despite the vaccines and even though yesterday was a very good day.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the role played by many people in the community.  I refer in particular to postmen and postwomen.  I have got the feeling in recent years that An Post has been driving its workers to make more use of their time and not to engage.  One of the greatest aspects of postmen and postwomen in this country is their engagement with people on the doorstep.  It is very significant.<\/p><p>In many ways, they are carers, particularly for people who are on their own.  They make sure they engage with the person before they leave their door.  We should never underestimate that.  In that way, Covid has had an advantage.  I welcome An Post having gone out of its way to encourage its staff to engage with, encourage, help and support people.  In my area, a local paper is delivered by postmen and postwomen.  It is not part of their run but they do it as a gesture of goodwill.  That type of engagement is very important.<\/p><p> Some of my points have already been addressed and I do not expect the witnesses to respond to them.  On the issues of water and broadband, I very much agree with Deputy Kerrane that there are issues on the islands that need to be dealt with speedily.  I know that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has been raising such issues for a long time.<\/p><p> I refer to one of the briefing documents provided.  On the issue of water, it states that responsibility for the provision of water services is not within the remit of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  On broadband, it states that responsibility for the roll-out of broadband is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  It further states that primary responsibility for the provision of health services on the islands lies with the HSE.  Is there a co-ordinated approach on these issues?  We are talking about a specific group of people in specific areas.  Is there a co-ordinated approach across Departments to address all of those problems that have been going on for years and need to be tackled and developed?  <\/p><p> On the issue of community groups, it is fair to say that a significant amount of money has been made available for grants to do specific things in a town, village or area, but one of the sections that has been suffering is that of development associations.  They are the people with an office in a town who keep the whole town going.  They are unofficial tourism offices.  They are usually staffed by T&uacute;s workers or whatever and that is fine.  However, they do not have money to pay electricity, phone or rent bills.  They cannot run their lotto competitions or many other fundraising activities.  It is just not possible for them to do so.  I think money for this group was announced in recent days by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  Is that money an assistance to help them to keep their offices going?  It is only a matter of a couple of thousand euro.  If they get over these few months and there is some type of return to some form of normality, as I hope there will be, they will be able to refocus on the way they used to raise funds.  In the meantime, to get them over this little hill, a small financial aid of a couple of thousand euro would keep the groups going until summer.  It would mean the offices could keep their services going.  We should remember that these are voluntary services.  The staff all work in a voluntary capacity.  I am seeking clarification on the matter.  If the witnesses cannot provide it now, they may come back to me on the matter.  Is the funding recently announced by the Minister specifically for people who are trying to keep those offices going and provide local services?  The groups will have to apply to their local authority to get the money.  I ask for clarification on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#G01200","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising those points.  I will first deal with the question on funding for various organisations and then address the issue of the islands.  The Senator is correct about the difficulties that have been faced, particularly by groups such as voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises.  They found it very difficult to avail of some of the supports the Government provided which were targeted at businesses operating on a commercial basis.  In May, the Department launched a new &euro;40 million support package precisely for the organisations referred to by the Deputy, that is, organisations that could not raise funds because of the Covid restrictions or social enterprises that could not trade because they simply had to close down or reduce the level of activity in which they were involved.  As part of that package, &euro;35 million was made available through a Covid-19 stability fund.  Some 600 organisations have received almost &euro;31 million under that fund.  Several island-based organisations were among those that received funding.  These are small amounts of funding that take account of the level or percentage of income the organisations have lost as a result of the Covid restrictions.  It is very much targeted at organisations providing front-line services in terms of childcare, elder care and so on in the community.  An additional &euro;10 million was allocated to the fund in October by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and that funding will be distributed shortly.<\/p> <p>  Separately, &euro;5 million was committed by the Government to a fund entitled Innovate Together.  The fund also attracts philanthropic support.  It too is funding community-based organisations, but is more aimed at helping them to adapt their organisations and services to be able to pivot and continue to operate in a post-Covid context.  It is probably worth stating that &euro;5 million was made available in the July stimulus package to help community centres to reopen safely.<\/p> <p>  Those are some of the initiatives that the Department has taken to try to support these organisations.  In addition, the community services programme helps to keep many of the organisations to which the Deputy referred staffed.  Although several organisations struggled with being able to keep their services running, the Department has continued to provide funding to those organisations.  I hope there is sufficient breadth of funding and initiatives available in this area.  If there are any particular organisations about which the Deputy would like to inquire, we can discuss that after the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I do not wish to hold up the meeting.  I thank Mr. Parnell for the clarification he provided, but I know of groups that are in need of assistance.  I refer to local community development associations.  They have an office and co-ordinate everything in the town.  For example, they support the town teams and act as an unofficial tourism office.  They do printing for voluntary groups.  In the case of some of the groups, it is not that they have been turned down for funding but, rather, that they never got a response when they sought funding for what they do.  If the witnesses cannot clarify this issue now, they may come back to me on it.  The CEO of Roscommon County Council spoke to me about this issue recently and outlined how important those local community development groups are in towns and villages.  There is no issue with regard to the workers who operate the offices.  The problems relate to lighting, heating and rental bills.  I know it is a very difficult area.  They are completely stranded in the context of funding.  My fear and that of the CEO of Roscommon County Council is that we will lose these voluntary groups..  There may be a way around this issue.  If the witnesses cannot give me an answer now, that is fine, but I would appreciate it if they were to come back to me on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#H00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":601,"content":"<p>The Senator raised an issue around the co-ordination of efforts for the islands.

One of the roles of the islands division within the Department is to try to co-ordinate across the various sectors and, to a certain degree, to advocate on behalf of island communities.  That is why it is so important for us to be able to meet with individual communities to hear what their individual needs are.  As set out in the briefing, we held meetings on many of the islands until we had to stop holding such meetings as a result of Covid.  However, we have continued them on an online basis.  The meetings give us a very good feel for what these issues are.  The decision to look at developing an islands policy was taken by Cabinet agreement.  That is the level of seriousness the Government applies on this issue.<\/p><p>This was decided at a Cabinet meeting, with all the Ministers agreeing that their individual Departments would look at whatever services are being delivered on the islands and would try to come together with a better policy.  From one perspective it is kind of fragmented but it would not make sense either for these services to be delivered just to those individuals.  What the Department of Rural and Community Development is doing, through the islands division, is trying to advocate for that and pull all of that together to give a bigger voice to these islands.  For all that they are rural communities they do have slightly different challenges from others.

Deputy Kerrane raised issues relating to regional development funding and the regional assemblies.  I have asked who was given the money the last time and received pages and pages of replies but they were all private companies.  I have nothing against that because we need to stimulate business in the area but there was nothing for infrastructure or that kind of thing.  It was all private companies.  Is there a role for the regional assemblies in the distribution of that money for infrastructure?  I am not talking about an advisory role.  There is a lot of misunderstanding there.<\/p> <p>  The Community Call is operated by The Wheel and Irish Rural Link.  I am absolutely fascinated by why the Department would not operate it.  It seems obvious that that brings in two layers when it should be one.  How was that done?  There are many areas in rural Ireland where The Wheel is unknown, and certainly Irish Rural Link is not that well known either.  It might be a little bit better known but not that well known.  How did they operate, on behalf of the Department, to get down into all the communities that do not have connections with these bodies?<\/p> <p>  The fund for community and voluntary, charity and social enterprises was a great idea because all these facilities and organisations had overheads and did not have their normal income.  The witnesses said 600 of them were funded but how many applications were received?  What percentage of these organisations were left with nothing?  It is fine to have bidding competitions but something as basic as meeting overheads does not solve the problem for the large number of organisations that bid for this, spent time making applications and got nothing.  I have always taken the view that it is better to divide less on more than more on less.  I would be interested to know how many applications the Department got for that fund.  We can then figure out how many cases applied and did not get funded.<\/p> <p>  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam maidir leis na hoile&aacute;in.

I refer to the previous action plan for rural development from 2017 to 2019, which had a key commitment and target of job creation, which was very welcome.  My issue with that, which is something I hope will be rectified in the new action plan, is that targets were met in job creation - 220,000 jobs - which was welcome but when one asks where those jobs are, one is told they are outside of Dublin.  That does not exactly narrow it down.  In this new action plan, I would very much like to see targets but I would like to see follow up also and that when we get to the end of the plan, information is provided as to where those jobs were created.  It is not enough to state \"outside of Dublin\".<\/p> <p>  While I greatly welcome the move to remote working, which is really positive, we do not want to see an over-reliance on that.  We need to see further job creation, which is so important.  When targets are set, I would like to see where those targets have been met so we can see whether there is a focus on the south as opposed to, perhaps, the west.  Can I flag that point, please?  Can Mr. Parnell tell me if the action plan will be published before the end of the year?<\/p> <p>  In respect of the schemes that exist, and there are many within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage which are welcome and do a great deal of good in many communities, is there any way in which there might be a one-stop shop?  On so many occasions a voluntary organisation, one with charitable status or a sports club, will approach a Deputy looking for a funding stream.  It would be great if it could go on to a website and state that it is a sports club and what it is looking for and that options would then come up on what it can apply for.  Much of the time clubs and organisations do not know what they can apply for and what the criteria are.  If all this information could be on one system, it would be very useful.<\/p> <p>  On the ongoing consultation on the islands policy, have we a date for the publication of that or even a rough idea on when that might be published?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#K01100","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":622,"content":"<p>On the report brought out by Pat Spillane a number of years ago, has that been consigned to the dustbin?

Deputy Kerrane referred to the new rural policy.  The development of the policy was delayed because of the Covid-19 crisis but we will have a stronger policy as a result of it because one of the key things the country, as a whole, is going to have to deal with is how to respond and recover both economically and socially from the impacts of Covid-19.  The publication is obviously a matter for the Minister and he has indicated that the new rural policy might be published early in the new year.<\/p> <p>  I certainly appreciate Deputy Kerrane&rsquo;s question on jobs.  The difficulty we have in measuring exactly where the jobs are is that the CSO, in its labour force survey, counts the jobs at the level of the subregion on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS 3 regions basis.  One will get details on employment in the north west or the south of the south east, for example.  The CSO does not capture that information at county level.  The only time people get clear and precise information about employment at county level is through the census.  That is a little bit of a challenge but we can certainly measure it at the NUTS 3 level.  In the case of, for example, the west of Ireland, this will include Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  We will be focusing very much on job creation as a key element of the new rural policy.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the idea of one-stop shop for different schemes.<\/p><p>There is information on all of our schemes on <i>gov.ie <\/i>but<i><\/i>I appreciate that as schemes grow in terms of the different target groups we are trying to reach, it can be difficult for people to navigate their way around.  I take on board the Deputy's suggestion.  There is, perhaps, more we can do to help improve our signposting and also streamline our application processes. <br\/><br\/>Senator Burke asked about Pat Spillane's report, which is the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report published in 2014.  It was built on by the Action Plan for Rural Development, to which Deputy Kerrane referred, which ran from 2017 to 2019.  There will be a new rural development policy.  The CEDRA report delivered on a number of its initiatives and proposals.  The central proposal of CEDRA was the need to establish a Department with a senior Minister responsible for rural development.  That has happened, as the committee will know.  All of the recommendations of the CEDRA report which had not been delivered at the end of 2016 were factored into the Action Plan for Rural Development.  We carried out a review of the CEDRA report last year, which we published on the Department's website.  The review sets out the status of all of the different recommendations made in the CEDRA report.  I am happy to forward that review to the Senator if he would find that helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Parnell.

I have an attitude in life that unless something is radically broken, do not mend it.

It is over the top and removes the immediacy of a programme.  That is a comment and I am not looking for a response.  I feel that strongly.  It has certainly worked well in Connemara where they just said that they would do it.  It has not been a problem.  There is an idea that we are involving public representatives.  Local authority members are on every LAG in the country.  The local authority had a big and a direct input.  They are now kind of on two LAGs.
