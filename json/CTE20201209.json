Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. <\/p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <\/p> <p>  I also ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard, and that when members are leaving and taking their seats, they sanitise their area.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120900002#A00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607531400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of &euro;540 million.  This was an increase of &euro;84 million, or nearly 19%, on the prior year.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure was distributed across five programmes.  These are defined in terms of strategic objectives, such as: a safe and secure Ireland; and access to justice for all.  Within the programmes, in addition to provision for standard administration functions, there are funding lines for key schemes and services operated directly as part of the Department, such as the Probation Service, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service and the Forensic Science Laboratory.  Funding is also provided for a number of State bodies that have a separate statutory existence, that operate under the aegis of the Department.<\/p> <p>  The largest expenditure programme relates to the range of services that together aim to provide an efficient, responsive and fair immigration asylum and citizenship system.  In 2019, the total spend for that programme was &euro;223 million.  This was up almost &euro;62 million, or 38%, year-on-year.  The largest component of this spending related to the cost of accommodation for asylum seekers, which totalled just under &euro;130 million in 2019.  The Department has attributed the 66% increase year-on-year in the spending on such accommodation to an increase in the numbers of asylum seekers accommodated, and to significantly greater reliance on more expensive emergency accommodation arrangements.<\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that responsibility for asylum seekers&rsquo; accommodation, along with a number of other subheads, has now been transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Processing of asylum applications remains the responsibility of the Department of Justice.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control relating to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120900002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1607531400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Before I ask for her opening statement, I would like to congratulate Ms McPhillips on her appointment as Secretary General of the Department.

In all, there are approximately 60 individual subheads across five expenditure programmes.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, the Department completed the largest restructuring in our 100-year history.  This transformation programme reshaped the organisation to more effectively deliver our strategic objectives; improve transparency and accountability; and create efficiencies through clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  This represented a step-change in how a Department is structured and operates, and turned the traditional Civil Service model on its head.<\/p> <p>  In the traditional model, the Department was structured by subject matter relating to different parts of the justice and equality sectors.  Staff worked across a wide range of activities, continually prioritising a competing variety of tasks, with differing levels of complexity, importance and urgency.  The transformation programme moved us from this conventional subject-based model, for instance, policing or immigration, to a functional model where we deal with policy and legislation, facilitating the development of specialisation and expertise.<\/p> <p>  While the formal restructuring element of the transformation programme was concluded in 2019, additional work continues to support and leverage the full value of our new structure.<\/p><p>A subgroup of the management board is developing initiatives to further develop our organisational culture in support of our vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  We also reviewed the Department&rsquo;s ICT infrastructure and capacity to deliver digital services.  Work is under way to implement a new ICT strategy, with digital reform set to be a key priority in our forthcoming strategy statement.<\/p><p> The transformation programme has sought to rebuild the Department to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.  This year&rsquo;s global pandemic has provided a significant test of this new structure.  Overall, our functional model has enabled us not only to react but also to respond dynamically to the crisis.  Although some service delivery areas have been quite severely impacted, our teams have a more focused remit and despite this unprecedented crisis, our functional structure has provided the capacity to retain a focus on long-term issues.  We have been able to refrain from diverting entire teams to crisis response and instead have been able to preserve that focus and keep work going on longer-term issues through our dedicated strategic policy units.<\/p><p> Our legislation functions have been agile in supporting Government to develop and progress proposals.  Since the outset of the crisis, our governance functions have played a central role in facilitating and driving collaboration and cohesion between the key agencies in the justice sector, while our operations units supported the establishment of crisis response teams in our key service delivery areas.  Our unique transparency function has co-ordinated and managed an unprecedented demand for information throughout the crisis for all our stakeholders and the public.<\/p><p> Regarding the transfer of functions, as the Vice Chairman referenced and as members are aware, the Government established a new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which required a transfer of functions order and the transfer of functions such as disability, equality, migrant integration, international protection accommodation, which is known as direct provision, and the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  This necessitated approximately 95 colleagues transferring, along with their work, to the newly created Department with effect from 14 October last.  A relatively small number of issues relating to youth justice transferred in our direction and are now managed by our criminal policy function.  This work mainly relates to the bail supervision scheme, which provides courts with an alternative to remanding a child in detention; a research partnership with the school of law, University of Limerick, which is aimed at the development of effective youth offender programmes; as well as a project under the Dormant Accounts Fund, building on the Greentown report which is developing interventions to protect children from the malign influence of criminal networks.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, there are a large number of agencies under the overall remit, some of which are funded from this Vote.  I refer in particular to Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, which had a significant underspend in 2019 relating to the long planned new purpose-built laboratory.  I am glad to report that construction started on that building in March and it is well under way, despite the impact of the pandemic on construction activities in the earlier part of the year.  This new laboratory will provide FSI with a modern, state-of-the art facility, supporting the highest standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage.  The aim is to have a forensic facility meeting all standards for the avoidance of contamination and the recovery, identification and interpretation of trace forensic evidence, including DNA.  This represents a significant and important investment in the criminal justice system.  The new building is expected to be completed in the summer of 2022.<\/p><p> I will also mention the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  While expenditure incurred for the bureau is reflected in the Vote, at &euro;9.860 million in 2019, the other side of the equation is not apparent from the account as the moneys collected go directly to the Exchequer.  The money returned to the State as a result of CAB actions was in excess of &euro;3.9 million in 2019, which includes &euro;1.6 million returned under the proceeds of crime legislation, just over &euro;2 million collected under Revenue legislation, and &euro;300,000 recovered in social welfare overpayments.  The bulk of these actions related to the proceeds of drug trafficking, followed by fraud and theft.<\/p><p> In addition, the value of assets frozen during the year was &euro;64.9 million, which is a very significant figure, compared with &euro;8.4 million in 2018.  That increase is due in the main to a significant seizure of cryptocurrency to the value of &euro;53 million.  There were 326 individual assets frozen, including financial assets, property, vehicles and jewellery.  In all, CAB brought 31 new proceeds of crime proceedings before the High Court in 2019, the largest number of new cases commenced by the bureau in a single year.  At an international level, CAB has maintained strong links and continues to liaise with law enforcement and judicial authorities throughout Europe and worldwide.<\/p><p> The work of the Legal Aid Board is also funded from this Vote.  The board operates a total of 30 full-time and 12 part-time offices.  It employs approximately 420 staff and provides services both via directly employed solicitors and panels of private practitioners who are engaged to provide services such as Abhaile and to service District Court family law matters. The board also provides free family mediation services in 16 family mediation offices, some of which are co-located with their law centres.<\/p><p> In the context of the pandemic and the need to prioritise services and safety for our most vulnerable citizens, the Department developed an inter-agency action plan to help support people at increased risk of domestic abuse during this period.  Members will have heard about the Garda Operation Faoiseamh, most recently this morning.  This was supported by priority measures across the entire system, including by the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service, for domestic abuse, sexual assault and child protection cases.  The Legal Aid Board help line is helping to deliver prompt legal advice and legal representation in court.  I will leave it at that, although I am happy to go into further detail if members wish me to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120900002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607531400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McPhillips.

It is okay saying that people can engage with the ombudsman and so on but that takes time and people are living their lives, perhaps, in very overcrowded facilities.

Along with my colleagues, we very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the scheme and to assist it in any way we can.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the background to the Bill, it is useful to recall some important milestones.  In response to growing public and political concern over the resale of event tickets for a multiple of their original sale price, our Department and the then Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport launched a public consultation on the issue on 20 January 2017.  On 31 January 2017, Noel Rock and Deputy Stephen Donnelly introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Prohibition of Above-cost Ticket Touting Bill 2017.  On 1 March 2017, the Sale of Tickets (Cultural and Sporting Events) Bill 2017 was introduced by the chairman of the committee, Deputy Quinlivan.  On 24 July 2018, the Government agreed to support on Second Stage the Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by Noel Rock and Deputy Stephen Donnelly and approved the drafting of a several amendments to it.  The Bill then lapsed upon the dissolution of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  All the Bills had, at their hearts, provisions to ensure fans were treated fairly.  That overriding objective is carried through into this scheme of the Bill.  The scheme now under scrutiny by the committee was approved for drafting by the Government on 29 September 2020.  While it has its origin in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill supported by the previous Government, it differs from it in a number of respects.<\/p><p> I am limited to five minutes so please excuse me for not going through the scheme provision by provision.  Instead, I will summarise.  The scheme aims to promote fairer access to event tickets by prohibiting the sale, or advertising for sale, of tickets for a price exceeding the original sale price for events taking place in designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 or more.  Applications for designation would be made by the operators of venues of this size who reasonably expect the venue to hold events that may give rise to above sale price resale.  The Minister would also have a reserve power to designate venues, including venues with a capacity of less than 1,000, that have not been the subject of an application for designation.  This approach of applying the prohibition to events in designated venues has been taken for two reasons.  First, above-face-value resale affects a small proportion of events and it is good practice to limit regulation to where it is necessary.  Second, the prohibition on above sale price resale can be more effectively monitored and enforced if it applies to events in a list of known venues.<\/p><p> Requiring primary ticket sellers to indicate if a ticket is for an event in a designated venue and secondary ticket sellers to indicate the original sale price of event tickets also assists enforcement.  The prohibition would not apply to authorised ticket sales held to fund the activities of charitable organisations and amateur sports clubs.  The ban on above-sale-price resale affects property rights so it is balanced by a prohibition, with some exceptions, of contract terms that preclude ticket holders from selling a ticket for a price at or below the original sale price.  In line with a commitment given by Government to UEFA, the unauthorised sale of tickets for matches during Euro 2020 is prohibited.<\/p><p> Other provisions deal with the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the provisions of the legislation, offences and penalties and defences, including the defences relating to secondary ticket marketplaces necessitated by the electronic commerce directive.  It was intended to include a prohibition on the use of bot software to purchase tickets, but a provision of this type now forms part of an EU directive and will be implemented along with the other provisions of the directive in the scheme of a Bill to be submitted to Government early next year.  Of course, the development of this scheme arose during the Covid-19 pandemic.  While we hope that it may be possible for events to take place without restrictions in the not too distant future, the need to control the spread of Covid-19 may require attendances to be limited for some time.  Limitations on attendance might increase the competition for tickets and could create both incentive and opportunity for the resale of tickets at inflated prices.  The proposed Bill will help ensure that this does not happen.<\/p><p> To conclude, the approach recognises that profiteering enriches opportunists with no interest or involvement in music or sport at the expense of sports and music fans, sporting bodies, artists and promoters.  We are happy to discuss the provisions of the scheme in more detail and to respond to questions from members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020120900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Newham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I will invite members to discuss the issue with the witnesses.

Second, what does face value mean in the digital world?  People can change the face value almost at will, so how will it be possible to keep track of what represents face value?<\/p> <p>  The committee has received a representation from a company called Viagogo, which is based in Limerick.  That company is engaged in market facilitation in respect of events.  What it is trying to secure is market clearance so that, like Ryanair, every seat is filled, so to speak.  It has flexibility to try to fill all the seats.  Will that business model go with this, and what would be the consequences?<\/p> <p>  Does designation envisage opt out?  Could venues decide that they are not going to apply this and get some type of agreement from the Minister that they will opt out?<\/p> <p>  My final question is on the effectiveness of enforcement.  It is widely alleged that appointments with the immigration service are being auctioned on line and it seems to persist.

However, it is generally in the interests of venues and promoters to opt in.  After all, they are generally part of the cohort of people who do not want the tickets to be resold at inflated prices.  Of course, some venues may opt out if they do not foresee having concerts or the like that they believe would fall under this scheme.

One of the Private Members' Bills that preceded this Bill included a 10% margin.  In other words, allowing tickets to be sold for 10% more than the face value.  Ultimately, we believed it was much simpler to just deal with the face value of the ticket.  It would make it more complex to introduce the concept of a margin.<\/p> <p>  In the context of face value in a digital world, that is an interesting point.  It is certainly one we can examine, but I do not believe even digital tickets are easy to tamper with in terms of changing the price on them.  This issue has not been raised with us previously so we are happy to look into it as part of the drafting process to see if it is possible.  I do not believe it is possible, but we can talk to promoters and the industry to see if it would be feasible.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that this is the business Viagogo is in.

I will try to work my way through the questions.  There is nothing in the Bill that will stop dynamic pricing because that is a matter for the primary ticket seller.  The Bill seeks to stop the secondary resale of tickets at a price above the original sale price.  Dynamic pricing is set by the primary seller and there is nothing in the Bill to stop that.  In the context of multiple event tickets or season tickets, the same applies.  There is nothing in the Bill that prevents the sale of tickets for multiple events or seasonal tickets by a primary seller.  Again, the Bill seeks to stop the resale of those tickets at a price above the original sale price.<\/p> <p>  On the enforcement and offshore websites, we are aware that this is a complex area.  There is no doubt that the borderless nature of the Internet makes it very difficult to enforce restrictions on online activity, such as those in the Bill against businesses or individuals based in other countries.  Deputy Stanton asked about legislation in other EU member states.  I believe a small number of member states have similar legislation in place.  Having spoken with officials in those countries and in EEA countries that prohibit or limit the resale of tickets above the original price, they have all acknowledged that while their legislation was reasonably effective in curtailing such resale within their national borders, it was less effective when it came to preventing resale by secondary sellers in other countries.  It is a really complex area.  There are other ways of dealing with it such as under the unfair commercial practices directive, which makes it a prohibited commercial practice to state or otherwise create the impression that one is selling something legally when it actually cannot be sold legally.  This provision was used by the Norwegian authorities to prosecute a Norwegian reseller for selling tickets to the London Olympics, in contravention of the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006.  The prosecution was appealed but it was upheld by the Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, in December 2019.  That, however, is a complex way of enforcing it.  We recognise that this is not going to be an easy one to enforce when it comes to dealing with offshore sales.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about greenfield sites such as those for festivals.  The organiser of the event is responsible for the sale of the tickets and is the primary seller.

It would be very unusual for promoters to have a computer system that changed the price of seats depending on the pattern of demand, for example as in the case of an airline like Ryanair.

This is why we have sought to balance that restriction with the provision prohibiting the contract terms that prevent a ticket holder from selling below the sale price.  As my colleague Mr. Newham said earlier, some event organisers would have done that in the past whereby part of the contract for the ticket prevented the ticket holder from selling below the original cost.

I will deal with the designated venues aspect of it first.  This approach has been taken principally for the reasons set out in Mr. Newham's opening statement.  First, the evidence available to the Department suggests that above-sale-price resale affects only a very small proportion of the thousands of ticketed events that take place in a normal year, so it is good regulatory practice to regulate only where it is necessary.  Second, the monitoring of compliance with this legislation would be much easier and more effective if the prohibition on above-sale-price resale prices applied only to tickets available in a publicly available list of known venues.  On the balance of looking at administrative burdens on businesses, it is worth noting that the Act will impose certain information requirements on the primary ticket sellers and it would be disproportionate to require small venues to comply with those requirements, especially given that they might never host any event that gives rise to above-sale-price resale.<\/p> <p>  On the threshold, the evidence available to the Department suggests that above-sale-price resales occur wholly or mainly in venues with a capacity of 1,000 or more.  A small number of venues with a capacity below that threshold might occasionally hold events that see some level of resale.  That is why head 17 of the Bill provides that the Minister can designate a venue which has not been the subject of an application for designation.  That is intended to cover venues with a capacity below 1,000 as well as venues with a capacity above that figure where the operators have not applied for designation.

For example, people may get tickets for Christmas or they may buy them and subsequently something comes up, such as a family event, and they cannot attend.  The reason behind the 10% element was to ensure that in the case that someone who had bought the ticket and had genuinely intended to go to an event, did not suffer any consequences.  If a person is selling a ticket on, they might have to post it to the buyer, or pay for delivery.

No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regimes.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  We have decided in advance that there will not be opening statements.

I want to start on the Internal Market Bill.  While the announcement yesterday was welcome, I do not think it was necessarily as big a deal as some people were making out.  I am interested to hear the witnesses' take on when we can expect the detail on how the British Government will implement the full terms of the protocol, what they expect to feed in, and what knock-on effect it would have, not just for North-South or east-west relations as it pertains to this island but also on how it will impact on the devolved nations throughout the United Kingdom, and I am particularly interested to hear from Dr. Whitford and Mr. Kinnock in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to something more general, whatever happens come 31 December relations will change greatly.  Mr. Benn and Mr. Mills have exchanged a number of times through these committees on the opportunity for bilateral relations and Anglo-Irish relations, and how as parliamentarians, leaving aside governments' responsibility, we can maximise the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement across all our Parliaments to ensure we do not let go of the level of co-operation that is there between the UK and Ireland that, sadly, is being taken away by Brexit.<\/p> <p>  I will pick on the witnesses individually.  Talks are in the ether in Brussels and certainly it is my opinion and, I assume, the opinion of my colleagues that a deal is in everybody's interests, especially those of Ireland and the UK.  From the point of view of the witnesses, do they expect a deal?  Do they hope for a deal?  Where do they believe the shape of a deal may appear in the coming days?  I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and I look forward to hearing from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#B00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I will begin.  I thank the Deputy for these questions and it is good to see him again virtually.  On the Internal Market Bill, because the announcement was only made yesterday we have not had a chance as a committee to discuss it but I very much welcome the agreement that was reached yesterday.  Michael Gove will be making a statement in the House of Commons later today and we anticipate we will hear more detail about how exactly the agreement in principle has been reached.  It has yet formally to be ratified, as I understand it, by the joint committee but there will be a meeting before the end of the year.  We read in the reports that agreement has been reached, for example, on how supermarket lorries bringing supplies to Northern Ireland will be dealt with, and it appears exit summary declarations on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain will not be required.<\/p> <p>  There is political significance.  Obviously there is a history to the Internal Market Bill, and various members of the committee from different parties will take different views on what the Government did, but at least an agreement has been reached because clearly there has been compromise on both sides.  This takes me to the Deputy's third question on the talks.  I have always thought there would be an agreement because the alternative is unthinkable.  It would have a big impact on the United Kingdom economy.  We saw that with the Office for Budget Responsibility report a couple of weeks ago.  We have discussed on our visits as a select committee to Dublin, and as the Deputy knows we have been twice, the impact it would have on the Republic of Ireland.  It is in nobody's interests and, therefore, it is the responsibility of the negotiators, and the politicians who give them their instructions, to find the middle ground which can be done.  That is how agreements are concluded.<\/p> <p>  The bilateral relationship it is hugely important.  It always has been.  I hope it will be strengthened in the future.  We will need to make the fullest possible use of the institutions that were created under the Good Friday Agreement because the relationship we have as joint members of the European Union will no longer be there.  I am sure I speak for all members of the committee in saying that a strong relationship between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland is something we are all very much committed to because we are bound together by so much history and so many shared interests now and in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hilary Benn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I have missed my trips to Ireland this year with the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  To share solidarity with the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly I thought I would wear the tie this morning.<\/p> <p>  I have always thought a good deal between the UK and EU was by far the best way of delivering Brexit.  It is going to be a messy January with people not being prepared because they did not think they would need to or because they have not worked out how to do it.  Having a messy compliance process on top of a real economic change would make for a really bad start to Brexit.  It is clearly in everyone's economic interest to do a trade deal.  There are all the other aspects of the future partnership we want to see also, which go far beyond trade.  I would hope to see one.  I have always expected to see one.  I have spent most of the year asking witnesses what percentage chance they give of a deal, but I suspect that percentage has somewhat come down from the heights of more likely than not or the 66% that Michael Gove used to give us.  It seems to be a lot harder and getting a lot later than any of us thought possible.  Who knows what the ratification process will be if we do see a deal.  I still think that is the most likely outcome but there will need to be some compromise on both sides to achieve it.<\/p> <p>  On the relationship, we will all miss the daily interactions that officials could have through EU channels and we need to find a way to recreate them.  We do have institutions for it through the Good Friday Agreement for North-South and east-west.  I am not sure the east-west interactions have been as effective or valued as perhaps they could have been and perhaps we need to find a way to reinvigorate them.  I recall about a decade ago, when David Cameron first became Prime Minister, they had a go at it and perhaps it is time to re-energise it.  We need to raise the importance of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly as a liaison for parliamentarians.  It meets but sometimes it struggles to get very good visitors or witnesses.  That is probably a weakness on the UK side.  On the Irish side we had the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, at the previous one in Ireland last year.  There is almost a choice between holding the meetings somewhere interesting in the UK or Ireland or holding them in London and Dublin and having the best possible people coming to speak to the assembly.  It is to be hoped on both sides we can re-energise it and at least find a way to meet virtually soon if we cannot do it physically for a little while longer.<\/p> <p>  On the Internal Market Bill, it is always going to be a challenge with the Northern Ireland protocol.  There is a lot of text in the withdrawal agreement on it but not a lot of it is very precise.  It is a very unusual situation to have part of one country sort of in the customs area of another area, or mainly in the customs territory of its home country but in the Single Market of another.  Much of the detail of how we make this work would have to be agreed with good co-operation and spirit on both sides.  It is regrettable we could not get around to that spirit of co-operation and trying to finesse another compromise until three weeks before it comes live.  To make it work there will have to be truly very close working between our tax authorities and your tax authorities.  It is very sad that four and a half years after the referendum we still have not quite got that good working on the ground.  They need to get that up and running pretty quickly in the new year between the tax authorities.  Many of the issues on the ground could be solved by joint working, compromise and flexible use of information that both sides have to tackle the real issues that will be there.<\/p><p>It is to be hoped, as we move forward, that we will be able to get that joint working up and running much more quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nigel Mills","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mills.

That is really important.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill, we do not know the detail of the agreement in principle Mr. Michael Gove reached yesterday, but it seems there might be some real positives involved, including with regard to determining the criteria for goods considered at risk when moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  I know that has been an issue in the past.  The exemption of agricultural and fish subsidies from state aid rules also seems to have been agreed in principle, as does the final list of the chairpersons of the arbitration panel for the dispute settlement mechanism.  Moving forward, there seems to be some agreement in principle.  I understand there needs to be an agreement which both the EU and UK will, at some point, ratify, going through the normal processes with their parliaments.  The joint committee will be reconvened to formally adopt such an agreement.  It is to be hoped it will come back later this week or at least before Christmas.  In saying all of this, I am only saying what I feel.  I am not speaking for the Government.  I think it is fair to say that is the case for all of us.<\/p> <p>  Regarding negotiations on the deal, I absolutely agree with Mr. Mills and Mr. Benn that a deal is the best possible outcome.  I am really hopeful that a deal can be agreed.  There are some sticking points, particularly on the level playing field, state aid and fisheries.  These are matters of sovereignty.  It is really important that the EU understands that we voted to leave not because we did not want a future relationship with the EU, but because we wanted to re-establish our sovereignty.  That is really important.  When we are looking at a future relationship, it is all very well to seek control over us in the future, but it is really important that we get on and have a relationship in which neither party has further control over the other.  We have to have that equality in the relationship.  That is what I would really push.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sally-Ann Hart"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation.  One of my biggest concerns about a no-deal outcome was that it might turn acrimonious and that we could enter a downward spiral of months of both sides blaming each other and being unwilling to talk.  There is no question that there has to be a future relationship.  The UK is still very close to Europe and Europe is still geographically very close to the UK.  Whatever that relationship might be, there has to be one.  One of the positive things we have seen this week is the intensification of talks and the seeking of solutions.  Regardless of whether there is a deal, I am more hopeful that there will not be an acrimonious, mud-slinging end to all of this, which would be detrimental to both sides.<\/p> <p>  From my point of view as one who is completely not a supporter of Brexit, I believe that any deal reached will be fairly thin.  There are many sectors which it will not cover.  The bureaucracy and delay at borders will arise whether there is a deal or not.  The fishermen in my constituency will not gain from leaving the Common Fisheries Policy because they fish langoustine, which is a non-quota catch.  They will, however, now face multiple pieces of paper, bureaucracy and the threat of border delays which will devalue their produce.  They are anxious as to whether they will even survive.  Some of them are talking about registering their boats in Northern Ireland, if possible, to allow them to have access to the Single Market.  This is not a comprehensive deal which covers finance and a range of other sectors.<\/p> <p>  Agreement has been reached on the Northern Ireland protocol, and that is definitely a positive step forward.  Being from Belfast, it is clear to me that not much thought was given to Northern Ireland back in 2016.  The Northern Ireland protocol was a sudden recognition of the difficulties described by Ms Hart and Mr. Mills.  The main thing is that there is now a drive to move away from hard positions and to find practical solutions for Northern Ireland.  The protocol, of course, applies whether there is a deal or not.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the UK Internal Market Bill, my understanding is that the House of Lords will now be asked to insist on its amendments, which would remove sections 44, 45 and 47, which include the offending provisions with regard to Northern Ireland.  As a Scottish Member of Parliament, I note that this does not remove the anti-devolution parts of the Bill.  From the point of view of Northern Ireland, which as I understand is the main interest of the committee, the common frameworks which had been worked on for three years and which allow for a way through divergence while still respecting the devolved governments' right to innovate, tend to drive standards up.  The Welsh Government was the first of the devolved governments to introduce the plastic carrier bag levy and Scotland's was first to introduce the smoking ban, minimum unit pricing for alcohol and a ban on plastic cotton buds.  Under the UK Internal Market Bill, the lowest standard must apply.  That is not just the case for British manufacturers, but for anything that is imported to any part of the UK.  The danger and the concern in the devolved nations is, therefore, that this would drive standards down because any Scottish or Welsh regulation about standards would only apply to their own producers.  This would disadvantage those producers without preventing substandard produce being sold in those territories.  This completely undermines the sort of innovation we have seen from all three devolved nations over the last 20 years.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the clause about spending in devolved areas, if one looks at the list, one sees that it includes almost every devolved area.  Westminster would take power over that spending rather than the devolved governments that understand what the needs are.  I know this is presented as a way of binding the union together but, from my perspective north of the border, this is like trying to sort a bad marriage by locking one's wife in the house and taking away her chequebook.  The way to strengthen a union is through respect and by allowing the devolved nations to continue with the powers they have rather than taking powers away.  From the point of view of strengthening the union, regardless of which of the three devolved nations one considers, the UK Internal Market Bill is going in completely the wrong direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philippa Whitford"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>My colleagues have covered a great deal of ground but I will briefly add to the discussion on the deal and the negotiations.

We will hear more from Mr. Michael Gove regarding the detail of what has been agreed in respect of the Northern Ireland protocol, but it appears that pragmatic compromises have been made.  It is interesting to note that EU customs officials will be stationed in Northern Ireland.  I am not quite sure how that squares with the very purist interpretation of sovereignty some have applied to these negotiations.  Nevertheless, it has been agreed and will clearly need to happen to make this whole deal workable.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of the UK Internal Market Bill on devolution, I completely agree with what Dr. Whitford has just said about the impact on the relationship between the UK Government and the devolved administrations.<\/p><p>It undermines trust and the ability to co-operate and communicate in a constructive manner.  We are worried that it could initiate a race to the bottom towards the lowest common denominator, in that, as goods enter the UK market, they become the standard across the board.  We are also concerned about it being a power grab in Wales, with UK Government ministers essentially being given the power to change the basic rules without the approval of the devolved parliaments and, in some cases, without even having to consult them.  We are worried that the hard-won rights and standards of Welsh producers, who are proud of the fact that Wales produces to the highest possible standards, could be undermined and different ones imposed by the UK Government almost by diktat.  The response from the Welsh Government and Welsh Members of Parliament is deep concern about the impact of the Internal Market Bill on devolution and what it means for a modern 21st century governance arrangement, which has to be based on co-operation and communication, not imposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kinnock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

Until I see the document, my authority is Mr. Tony Connelly of RT&Eacute;, who published a briefing this morning that indicates there is a great deal of unsettled business.  When we see the detail, I do not think this will be a finished matter and I believe there will be some pushback, but we will wait and see.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the trade agreement, we constantly talk around the same three issues.  We throw in words like \"sovereignty\" as if sovereignty only applies to one side.  Obviously, the sovereignty of the Internal Market has to be protected as well.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the next phase because the other two elements are largely outside our control.  A deal will be struck in the next few days or it will not.  I am deeply concerned about the future consequences for relationships between Ireland and the UK in particular.  Obviously, the relationship between Ireland and the EU is important, but the relationship between Ireland and the UK is strategically important for us all.  If there is no deal, there will be a fair degree of acrimony, which will make getting back to the table for the inevitable deal that has to be struck much more problematic and difficult.<\/p> <p>  As parliamentarians, we can play a part in addressing some of these concerns.  Mr. Mills mentioned the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I am a new member of it and hope to work on the economic side, which will be important.  The BIPA has functioned, but we can revitalise it in a way that has not previously been done and that greatly strengthens the bilateral relationship that will be significantly dislodged if there is a thin deal, which is the best option on the table right now, or seriously impacted if there is no deal at all.  I would be interested in whoever Mr. Benn nominates addressing the aftermath and how we can work together as parliamentarians to ensure the strongest co-operation and economic reconnection.  For example, Ireland has opened a new consulate in the north of England as part of our preparations, but that is only one in a series of steps that we need to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#D00700","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.

The bookmakers are marginally in favour of a deal happening if Deputy Calleary wants to put money on it, but I would not recommend that.<\/p> <p>  The BIPA has not met this year for various reasons, including the elections in both nations, and it must be reformed.  Covid also means that we cannot meet physically.  There is a need to review the BIPA's committee set-up.  Some are more active than others depending on who the chair is.  There is probably a role for a committee to examine UK-Irish relations, how they could be enhanced and what institutions could be put in place to make them work on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis.

Fishing is a largely totemic issue, in that it is a small part of the overall UK economy, but it is critical for vulnerable coastal communities.  In Scotland, I think of the island communities in particular.  For them, it is a large part of their economy and local cultures and structures.  It is an important industry in certain areas.  Scotland has the majority of the UK's fishing industry.<\/p> <p>  It seems to be the key sector where people supporting Brexit could come up with a positive, as in the UK gaining more quota by leaving the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p><p>A lot of the problems with quota in the UK do not relate to the Common Fisheries Policy.  In Scotland, 80% of boats share just 1% of quota.  In England, it is 77% of boats sharing 3% of quota.  That is because quota in the UK was allowed to be bought and sold.  Indeed, many skippers sold their quota to Dutch and Spanish fleets, and that does not change.  <\/p><p> There is a lot of talk about the benefit of extra quota for the catching sector of the industry.  Particularly if we have a no-deal with tariffs, the more one processes that fish, whether one trims, freezes or smokes it, the more tariffs start to climb.<\/p><p> Of course, we also have the live industry and the fresh industry.  For them, the sudden imposition of paperwork and the cost of that paperwork as well as the delays that are expected between Dover and Calais would mean that the langoustines that come from my constituency could be worthless by the time the product arrives in Europe or significantly more expensive.  If tariffs of 12% were introduced, it is estimated that would be &pound;1 per kilo and as the boats are only paid &pound;4 per kilo then that is a significant loss from the supply chain.<\/p><p> The attitude was one of we will get all of this quota back.  However, the industry is much smaller than it was so it would take time to build up.  The problem is that the UK exports about 70% of what it catches but imports about 70% of what it eats so we need a market to sell the fish we catch into and that just was not discussed back in 2016.  It has been held up as a totemic issue but my local fishermen and, indeed, fishermen across Scotland, including the big players, are now very concerned about what the reality of Brexit means for the fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#D01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philippa Whitford","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question that Deputy Calleary asked about a level playing field.  We need to be clear that there is a difference between non-regression, on the one hand, and a ratchet, on the other hand.  It is perfectly reasonable to say we are going to negotiate a deal and we know where we all are at the moment, as we have common standards because we have all been in the European Union together.  What is clearly not acceptable to the UK Government is the suggestion that if the standards are raised in the EU there should be an obligation on the UK to raise them in the same way.  That is not going to work.  Although of course, in the EU, we have always been able, as individual member states, to improve on environmental or workers' rights standards if we wanted to and, therefore, it seems to me that is a fair and reasonable basis.<\/p> <p>  The second thing we all know is that one must have a dispute resolution mechanism and ultimately someone has to decide.  It is not going to be the European Court of Justice because the EU started out by saying, we would like them to do that, and that was never going to be acceptable to the current UK Government.  It is not going to be the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.  It is going to have to be an independent arbitrator and that is what the withdrawal agreement provides for in Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol.  The principle there is of an independent arbitrator ultimately deciding alongside two other people, with one from each side.  That, it seems to me, would be the shape of a sensible agreement on a level playing field. <\/p> <p>  It is good to talk to Deputy Howlin again.  I really do worry, as all of us do, about the economic consequences of a no-deal for both of us but also politically, as Dr. Whitford pointed out earlier, about what that would do because there will be recrimination.  Of course each side will blame the other.  We all know who is going to blame who.  That is why in the very short amount of time that we have left, the responsibility on all of us who are watching - we are spectators to the negotiations - is to say to the negotiators, and the political leaders \"you must do your job, you must deliver a deal\".  As Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with which I agree, and I do not agree with him on many things, it would be a failure of state craft if there was no agreement.  We cannot possibly have no agreement because the stakes are far too high.

As we know, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, went to Washington earlier this year as, indeed did the UK Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, to discuss this situation.  President-elect Biden did say that there can be no trade agreement if the Good Friday Agreement is interfered with or a hard border is reintroduced on the island of Ireland.  Obviously we await details but the matter is being talked about in media and political circles here.  Do the witnesses think that influenced the decision by the British Government yesterday on the Northern Ireland protocol?<\/p> <p>  This morning, both committees have spoken here about the British-Irish relationship.  Obviously it is very important to develop and enhance that as Britain leaves the European Union.  We have the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly; the British-Irish Council that was set up under the Good Friday Agreement that involves the Governments and Executives on these islands; and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference that was set up under the Good Friday Agreement as well at Government level.<\/p><p>Last week, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister agreed to begin work on a strategic review of the Irish-British relationship.  This will set out structures and frameworks for building on east-west engagement and co-operation in the post-Brexit landscape.  The need to develop structures for formal engagement between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister at ministerial and official level to formalise co-operation across a suite of policy areas is also mentioned.  That is a very welcome initiative by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, one we should all feed into, including this committee, the UK select committee or a sister committee in the House of Commons.  The Oireachtas will need to engage in that as well.  As I said, it is a worthwhile initiative to build on the existing structures and to develop new structures.  As parliamentarians, we should all have an input into that.  <\/p><p> My second question is the same question raised by Deputy Howlin.  If there is no trade agreement this week, is it not obvious that many of these issues are back on the table on 1 January and that they will have to be dealt with?  I presume the witnesses would agree that we are going to have to deal with the issues of fisheries, trade, aviation and so on at some stage.  Brexit is not going away.

Like Deputy Haughey, I would like to know if there was US influence to pull back on the withdrawal agreement.  I agree with Deputy Richmond that it is good news and some progress but it only takes us back to where we thought we were a year ago with an agreement that was already in place.  It is entirely separate to the future trade agreement, in respect of which there still appear to be significant gaps.  I am concerned at the pessimistic view being expressed by Michel Barnier and others that there is still a long way to go on governance, a level playing field and fisheries.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on fisheries, which Dr. Whitford might have a view on.  I refer to the surprise suggestion from the UK Government that a large part of the pelagic stock might be dealt with under the informal forum of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.  There is huge opposition to this from an EU perspective because of the history of that forum and the fact that very often the non-binding type gentleman's agreement in terms of quotas is very often exceeded and it is an annual conversation which does not allow anyone to plan ahead.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on that proposal from the UK Government?  Do they think it is workable and are they aware of the motivation of the UK Government for putting that on the table?<\/p> <p>  My second question is a little more specific so I am not sure which of the witnesses will be able to respond to it.  It is about Dover Port from Ireland's perspective.  The witnesses will know that we use the land bridge to get much of our exports in and out through Dublin Port to Dover and on to Calais.  We have a plan in place at Dublin Port, where there has been a lot of infrastructure development.  We have a traffic management plan in place and we are anticipating some delays and congestion even with a deal in place.  We are struggling to get information around Dover.  There is a reluctance to interfere because obviously it is preparation from the UK perspective.  Can the witnesses provide any insight on what preparations are being made and how they think Dover might work?  Our trucks will be in the same position as Scottish and British trucks when they get to Dover.

We are all aware of the public comments that President-elect Biden and Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, have made about what might be the consequences of any undermining of the Good Friday Agreement.  That has been made clear.  I agree with Senator Chambers that we are back where we started, although in fairness the withdrawal agreement did not get into the specific details of how one deals with a lorry load of goods bound for a supermarket in Belfast.  We hope to hear more about that this afternoon.  I have some sympathy with the joint committee that it had to turn broad principles in regard to risk into something that can be made to work in practice.  The evidence we have had in front of the select committee is that those trading east-west and west-east, with a month or two to go, had no idea what the arrangements will be.  I hope we will hear more about that this afternoon.  <\/p> <p>  On the strategic review mentioned by Deputy Haughey, it is a very sensible initiative.  We must safeguard what was carefully put together in the Good Friday Agreement but as I said earlier my hope is that that relationship will be strengthened.  If there can be a joint agreement on any changes or additions to the way in which we talk to each other and build our relationship then we should all welcome that.  I agree with Deputy Haughey's point on negotiations continuing.  I suspect that will happen whether there is an agreement or not because the general consensus in some respects is that any deal will be on the thin side, such that when people see it, they are likely to raise questions about this and that.  If there is no deal, will that be the end?  Are we going to say that is it, bye bye?  I find that hard to believe.  It would be very painful for all of us to go through no deal and, having realised that was not very sensible, to then have to come back around the table and try to find a way forward.  <\/p> <p>  The other point I would make is that Brexit has happened legally.  The UK has left the European Union and it leaves the Single Market and the customs union arrangements at the end of this month.  Therefore, it seems to me the question for British politics, whether one is for Brexit or against it - Senators and Deputies can tell from the membership of this delegation this morning we are on different sides of the argument - is what should our future relationship be with our biggest, nearest and most important trading partners, friends and countries we co-operate with on security and defence?  From my point of view, I would say we want the closest possible relationship that works in our mutual interest.  That is what I am hoping for.  Maybe, as Brexit politics, of which there has been a lot in this, gradually fades away because one side won in terms of the debate, however much I regret that, we can turn to the real question of how we are going to get on in future.  Then, we can judge every item that is being negotiated on the basis of whether it is good for the country.  I am certain that we will be continuing negotiations and a dialogue.  Ms Hart has indicated in regard to the Dover question so I will pass over to her at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hilary Benn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I wanted to come back on the Biden point, not on Dover.  It is important to reinforce that the contentious clauses in the internal market Bill were to protect the Northern Ireland protocol and the Good Friday Agreement.  When we have the agreement in principle by the joint committee yesterday, in particular with regard to the protocol on Northern Ireland, that in itself is very hopeful.  We have not seen the detail of it yet but because of that agreement in principle, the Government has withdrawn those contentious clauses which were to protect the GB-Northern Ireland trade in the event of a no-deal.  There is hope.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the future relationship, I agree with everybody that we need to have the closest possible relationship.  People have talked about Brexit is a type of divorce.  In a divorce when there is a clean break it is then possible to develop a future relationship, which is often easier than when there is no clean break and one party is paying maintenance or still has control.  It is important to consider that.

Obviously, there has been a lot of preparation done, mainly to try make sure that hauliers have got the paperwork and that is checked and confirmed before they try to use it anywhere near Dover.  This is to try and avoid a truck starting to be allowed into France blocking the port for all those who have got the right paperwork.  In the UK, it is likely that we will phase in all our new controls over a six-month period.  We will not be holding over the EU and will be prepared to allow some faith in transition at the start of the new year.  Perhaps that would be a positive step for the EU if negotiations succeed or fail, if the EU could make a similar gesture to try and avoid it being a real mess in Calais or, even, in Northern Ireland.  There will need to be some phasing in of these rules in the early part.<\/p> <p>  I have no idea whether President-elect Biden has had any influence on this.  My main suspicion would be that we knew we definitely had to come up with a workable solution for most of these issues in the protocol.  That got tied up in the politics of the negotiation and therefore took a lot longer and perhaps some, not quite threats but, pointing out that if we did not agree to this then we would not be allowed to do that between the mainland and Northern Ireland probably prompted an overreaction from the UK Government.  I hope we have managed to get past that.  It is perfectly reasonable for the loyalist community in Northern Ireland to have real concerns about economic barriers turning up between Northern Ireland and the mainland.  It is almost unprecedented around the world to have two parts of a country in different customs areas and thus creating new obligations.  It is not just a one-way issue - the Good Friday Agreement and the consent principle.  That is a two-way issue for both communities.  It is important for both sides of this to work together and find flexible working arrangements that make the rather unusual strained economic position in which we are putting Northern Ireland work on the ground.  That will take the compliance authorities to take a risk-based approach to this and look for where the real risks and the real problems of goods getting across without paying the right tariffs or without meeting the right rules are, and not try and focus those on every small transaction that happens which would be unsustainable.  What we need to do is move into that phase of having compliance work of this on the ground and not the arguing over the high principles so much on which we will never find a perfect solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nigel Mills"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Dr. Whitford wanted to come in briefly.

It is absolutely critical that we put more effort into the British-Irish relationship and, indeed, find new structures for a UK-EU relationship because the informal meeting within the UK at EU summits, etc., will not be there.  What people are less aware about the Good Friday Agreement is how much of it came about because of the friendship that developed between John Major and Albert Reynolds as a result of their meeting in neutral ground in the EU.  That has not been given very much credit.  There will still be many aspects of the position Northern Ireland has been put in that will need to be hammered out.  It is, as Mr. Mills and others have said, an unusual position.<\/p> <p>  We will come across things we have not thought about.  One of the concerns is whether European citizens living long term in Ireland and working for Irish companies will be able to travel into the North or, indeed, across to Scotland to mend a computer or install an IT system.  Some of these things are still not clear.<\/p> <p>  Personally, I had a concern that these clauses in the UK Internal Market Bill were about creating leverage because they have now been removed.  The problem is that it has undermined the UK's reputation and it has made the issue of governance bigger.<\/p> <p>  Coming to the issue of fishing and having annual quotas and a gentlemen's agreement, the problem with annual quotas is, even for the industry, for it to invest in new vessels, improved vessels or new equipment, there is a requirement for the industry to know, over a longer period, what kind of quota it has access to.  In addition, there is not a great advantage for the UK industry in having annual quotas.  Unfortunately, the UK Internal Market Bill - and where we are at present - undermines any sense of \"Let us just have a gentlemen's agreement\".  Things will need to be defined.  They will need to be pinned down so that both sides can count on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philippa Whitford"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hilary Benn"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

Maybe we would be better doing that in private session.  Apologies in advance if I repeat what has already been said.<\/p> <p>  We all welcome what happened yesterday but we need to see implementation at this point of the Irish protocol.  As much as everybody is talking about the possibility of a deal being 50-50, I suppose there is a hope that we are working on the basis that Boris Johnson and Britain need this deal.  Given that 45% of Britain's exports go to the European Union, the impact that will have on their economy has to be enormous in a worst-case scenario.<\/p> <p>  There is belief among many people here that the amendments included in the UK Internal Market Bill and what was being proposed in the context of taxation in the UK Finance Bill were introduced as a negotiating gambit and almost something that was put on the table so that they could take it off.  Whether that relates to President-elect Biden or not, we did not see it here as a protection of the Good Friday Agreement or anything relating to the island of Ireland.  This has given rise to a credibility issue on Britain's part for the future.  I could claim that I am not shocked by Britain moving goalposts in the context of the negotiations, but it does create difficulties.  It even creates difficulties for Britain right now.<\/p> <p>  I was not going to say this but I will.  It can be quite difficult at times to listen to British politicians talking about national sovereignty and anomalies in relation to the North, particularly as regards Brexit.  Being absolutely straight, I would say that the fact that we have partition on the island of Ireland is due to previous British Governments deciding what suited them from a point of view of their own interests and not ours.  Anyway, I have said it now.<\/p> <p>  It would be absolutely ridiculous from a British point of view for there not to be a trade agreement.  Even if there is a thin trade agreement, one is talking about going back to negotiations.  The difficulty will be that that leaves future room for crisis, uncertainty and difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I would like to put a question to Dr. Whitford in respect of Scotland.  I imagine that a worst-case scenario would change the dynamic in Scottish politics.<\/p> <p>  On fisheries, there is a view out there regarding what Britain is seeking.  Obviously, Boris Johnson needs two outcomes.  He needs a deal, but he also needs to be able to sell a deal to the Brexiteers that there was a point to Brexit.  I am not quite sure how he will be able to handle that.  I am worried about fisheries.  There is a view that Britain is making a grab for fishing rights in circumstances where its industry lacks the capacity necessary to fish the relevant waters.  I am not sure where matters stand in that regard.<\/p><p>I add my voice to all those who have asked what are the preparations for any type of Brexit in Britain.  It is a huge difficulty for us, including the land bridge.  The National Audit Office has said that preparations are nowhere near what is necessary to be fully operational on 1 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#G00900","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Whitford to respond on fisheries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hilary Benn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Okay.

I do not think any politician in Scotland wants to see havoc.  Unfortunately, even the deal we might get will be so thin that there will still be a 6.1% reduction in where our GDP would have been had we stayed in the EU; it is about 8.5% if it is a no deal.  Even with the free trade agreement that may be on the table, the impact on us is significant.<\/p> <p>  Scotland has seen a consistent move of support towards independence since the UK actually left the EU at the end of January.  There is no question that Brexit, which is completely against the wishes of the majority of Scottish voters, is the foundation of what is changing people's minds.  Last year, the polls did not change because there was still hope that Brexit would not actually happen, that some other route would be found or even that, as the Scottish Government put forward as a compromise in 2016 in the Scotland's Place in Europe report, we would stay in the Single Market and customs union while inside the UK, that is either the whole UK, or Scotland and Northern Ireland, which could have helped solve that problem.  Since the UK actually left the EU at the end of January, support for independence has grown, and that will only continue to strengthen.<\/p> <p>  A no deal is damaging to everybody.  It was a matter of Brexit on its own but also the way Scotland has been treated by the Government by not having respect paid to it and not being included in the negotiations, despite the then Prime Minister Theresa May originally saying she would consult across the UK and find a deal that all parts of the UK would support.  She did not do that.  The UK Internal Market Bill is no way to improve a relationship and I think Scotland is heading in one direction only.  On Boris Johnson's refusal to consider a referendum for Scotland, I suggest to those who supported Brexit, the idea that the EU might have said that the UK could not even hold a referendum on its EU membership would not have gone down very well.  The current refusal goes down precisely the same in Scotland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philippa Whitford"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>That could set off quite a debate which the committee may or may not want to hear.

To be frank, there are some people at this meeting who would agree that we thought it was a negotiating tactic and others who would say it was a necessary backstop because the terms of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol were not specific enough about how to interpret goods at risk and what checks and so on would be required.  What is not in dispute, whatever side of that question one finds oneself, is that it did affect trust between the negotiating partners.  If a year ago, the EU had negotiated a deal with the UK and then the UK Government said it was proposing unilaterally to vary part of the agreement it had negotiated, read, signed up to, and given effect to in our Parliament, it does raise concerns in the minds of the EU side, because if something which it thought was agreed and was an international binding treaty turns out not to be an international binding treaty and can be varied by one side, then there is a bit of a problem when it comes to negotiating a new agreement.  That is why the withdrawal of the clauses is so important.  The Government is now saying it will not break international law and it does restore some sense of confidence in what was negotiated, but it has left a lingering effect which has impacted on the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020120900002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hilary Benn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I think this is our last round of questions and it would be good to finish on the word \"trust\".

If we are going to rebuild trust and strengthen relationships in the new post-Brexit world, the UK-Ireland relationship is central, as is the relationship between our two parliaments.

I am two months into my role as Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Market Union.  To some extent my mandate has been set out in the letter the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, sent to me on my appointment.  There are a few specific areas that colleagues might like to come back on but generally, it refers to progressing banking union, capital markets union, dealing with green finance and a strategy on how we move towards a more sustainable and a more digital economy.  It looks at a fintech strategy because technological solutions are coming at an advanced speed, particularly given the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p><p> One of the other issues we are considering in detail concerns our review of the non-financial reporting directive, whereby companies have to report not just on profit but also on how they have an impact on society, the environment, human rights, etc.  We want to make sure that in future, financial and non-financial information will be equal when it comes to accounts.  That is quite a leap.  We already have some standards but this will be a leap forward.  While Europe is doing its own thing, it is very much considering the global work on this.  It is fair to say the EU is likely to move further and faster than the rest of the world when it comes to asking corporations to account for non-financial matters.  It is therefore required that we scrutinise the relevant information.  One point of feedback we get from investors is that they find it difficult to obtain sufficient information to compare companies.  There is now much greater emphasis on this, even among asset managers and individual investors, who want to be able to say they are investing in sustainable projects.  This will intensify.  In the early part of next year, I will be introducing a sustainable finance strategy.  There will be a very interesting debate on that.  In other words, all our activities within the Commission are focused on our reorienting the European economy to make it more sustainable.<\/p><p> In tandem &mdash; we have seen this already because of Covid-19 &mdash; we are moving towards a more digitalised economy.  That is the strategy.  In the financial sector, in particular, we are aware that cash is still used but because of Covid, there is much more use of cards and instant-payment transactions without cash.  That is something we are watching.  We do not want to diminish the role of cash but we must make sure the solutions that are provided are regulated.  While instant payment is really positive, there are clearly concerns over fraud and protecting consumers.<\/p><p> Another area of my work concerns anti-money laundering.  Up to now, member states have had their own financial investigative units.  There has been a variety of approaches among member states and no genuine European co-ordination.  There is now political consensus among the member states that we need European co-ordination so a European agency to co-ordinate what is happening at member state level is required.  There is support for that.  We will work to make sure the financial investigative units within the member states network better and also network effectively with Europol.  Therefore, there are many aspects of the work I am charged with.<\/p><p> One of the most far-reaching aspects of my work concerns sustainable finance.  We have to try to encourage the move away from investment in projects or sectors that do harm to the climate, environment and biodiversity.  The major question, which may arise in our conversation, concerns how we accommodate the transition for sectors that want to be sustainable, considering that we know, through our taxonomy, what the best is.  This is quite a difficult area.<\/p><p> I shall mention two other issues on which questions may arise.  One is the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the future budget.  As members know, there are important negotiations continuing on that.  In addition, there is work on the next-generation EU fund, which involves a significant proposal regarding a very significant amount of money to help the EU to recover from the Covid crisis.<\/p><p> Last, I will mention Brexit.  Members know the state of play.  I share the pessimism of the Taoiseach when he spoke in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  In the Commission, we have particular concerns about making sure any state with access to the Single Market &mdash; in this case, the UK &mdash; plays by the rules of that market.  Other issues arise, including governance and the fishing sector.  Today, we are preparing contingency plans.  They are very specific and very narrowly focused to make sure that in the event of no deal, which we hope will not be the outcome, specific plans will be put in place to maintain connectivity for those sectors that are vulnerable, such as transport and aviation.<\/p><p> While we are looking forward to the meeting that will take place between the UK Prime Minister and the President of the Commission, I am not very confident about it considering the speech made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons today, or at least the excerpts I have read.  There is a failure to understand that membership of the EU means something, that if a state is part of the EU, it is in the Single Market and customs union, and that member states make rules together.  Perhaps this was a failure of Brexit at the very outset.  If, as has happened, a state chooses to leave, there are consequences for it, particularly where it wants to stay part of the Single Market.  The EU is doing no more than it would in any other case.  What it is doing is protecting the Single Market of the EU 27, which has been built up over decades with the UK.  There is a failure in the UK to understand that.  This has not just arisen in recent days; it has featured from the very outset of the Brexit process.<\/p><p> On a slightly more optimistic note, I welcome the agreement on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.  I believed it very perverse that any country would use a statement in its Parliament that it would break international law as a threat in a negotiation.  It was most unhelpful and unwelcome.  The rowing back on that is welcome.  It shows some understanding that it was never appropriate in the first place.<\/p><p> While we are hoping for a deal, we must also prepare for the possibility of there not being an agreement.  We have said over weeks, months and years that time is running out.  The prospect of the negotiation running into next week is really not realistic if a deal is to be ratified through the European Parliament and perhaps other parliaments.  Therefore, we are running out of road.  We are aware of that.  In Europe, we are prepared and know what needs to be done.  I hope the British Prime Minister will conclude when he comes to Brussels today that if he wants Britain to be part of the Single Market while remaining outside the European Union, it must meet the standards we have in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#B00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Choimisin&eacute;ir.

We are aware that NPLs have featured quite significantly across the three State-owned banks and have reduced gradually over recent years.  At the end of last year, the proportion was just below 5% but unfortunately it has increased since then, to just above 6% at the end of June.  On 2 December, the Commissioner said that NPLs would receive her full attention and that we need to find a mechanism to unburden banks with NPLs.  I am aware that the Directorate-General will introduce what is called a new comprehensive NPL strategy in the next two weeks.  Can the Commissioner tell us what that strategy will involve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#B00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The strategy will be unveiled next week.  It is a communication.  I will explain why we are producing it this year.  The Deputy rightly said there were problems with NPLs in the past in Ireland.  There were also problems in other member states.  Currently, because of the supports coming from member states, the policy of the European Central Bank, and various moratoria, we do not have a problem now.  We do not want to have a problem.  There are two aspects to this.  First, borrowers and lenders should identify at this stage individuals or sectors in respect of which problems might arise and there might be an agreement on restructuring.  However, there is a concern that as this crisis unfolds into next year, some sectors and enterprises will not be able to recover and, therefore, may not be able to repay loans.<\/p><p>The dilemma, which I referenced in my hearing, is that if we leave non-performing loans on-balance sheet in the banks, they then are impaired in terms of being able to lend to the real economy.  The objective is to have the groundwork prepared if this occurs, and we do not know to what extent that it might.  In the past, member states dealt with this in different ways, one way being as an asset management company, a securitisation where non-performing loans are moved off-balance sheet, purchased by risk-takers, and on which is put various names.  That will frees up the balance sheets of banks.<\/p><p> It is hugely important that the protection of borrowers is foremost in our minds and we know of experiences in the past.  Indeed, I was, and probably still am, an elected representative in that I would have dealt this year with individual constituents who had loans that were bought by so-called vulture funds but they could not make contact with them.  I am well aware of what happened in the past.  That is why in our work here with the Directorate-General, DG, we have been stressing, as it has in return, the importance of protecting borrowers who might find themselves in a position where they are unable to repay loans.  It is a difficult balancing act.  That is why I initially referenced the importance of now.  I mean those who feel they will have a problem with not being able to meet their commitments and banks which see this problem to deal at the individual level first.  In the strategy, the details of which will be unveiled next week, we will look at how we set forward a framework that member states can choose from to meet these challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Commissioner's comments.  The language that she used was about unburdening banks with non-performing loans so they can lend into the real economy.  These loans are individuals, people and families.  I happened to meet one of these families on my way in here about 20 minutes ago.  They are a real family who have lost their home as they face into Christmas and they are part of the real economy.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner said we need to learn from the past.  What lessons have been learned?  Does she believe that when a bank enters into a contract with an individual to provide lending but the individual falls on hard times, whether that is due to a pandemic or a recession, the bank has a responsibility that goes beyond, to use her language, \"unburdening\" that loan so it can lend to others who will continue to increase its profits and has a moral and financial obligation to the family to work through the loan?<\/p> <p>  The Commission seems to be trying to make it easier for banks to sell loans to vulture funds.  I ask the Commissioner to talk about the framework that would allow for the establishment of asset managed companies.  It has been suggested that this would only apply to business loans.  Does the Commissioner see this also applying to family homes?  I mean where one could have a National Asset Management Agency-type entity that would take the loans off the balance sheets of the banks,  and, therefore, doing as she has suggested, but not the likes of Cerberus, which is a complete and utter vulture that treated its customers with disdain.  It is not just about being able to talk to somebody; it is how people are treated.  The problem is that vulture funds, by their definition, do not have a long-term interest in the Irish economy.  One cannot take a 30-year product or a 25-year mortgage and feel that it is secure in the hands of a vulture fund.  I worry about the direction we are going in.  If I were part of a young couple starting off and taking out a mortgage, I would worry about where the mortgage would end up if hard times occurred.  Indeed, it does not have to be a case of non-performing loans because we have seen in the past that banks sold performing loans to vulture funds.  Yes, these are regulated now but vulture funds, like any bank, can increase their variable interest rates to whatever level they want.  The reason mainstream banks do not do that is because of competition.  Vulture funds do not provide as much freedom or flexibility to manoeuvre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#C00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I do not think there is much that divides us Deputy.  As I said in my remarks, I am as concerned as he is about those who find themselves in hard times.  This time the crisis has not arisen due to past mistakes made by banks or people over borrowing.  This time we have businesses and individuals, as he pointed out, who for no reason of their own find themselves in a very difficult place and I have a full understanding of that.  In fact, in my conversations at the Commission, I speak to the specialist teams about the importance of protecting the individual and ensuring that if banks sell bundles of loans to another vehicle, the protection of the borrower is as strong in that move as it was with the original borrower.  I think we have learned that lesson.<\/p> <p>  I used the word \"unburden\" in connection with balance sheets.  We know that the current flow of credit from banks in this crisis have helped to keep the real economy afloat.  What we do not want to see but must prepare for is a time when there might be a build up of non-performing loans.  The Deputy referenced that in Ireland there has been a significant decrease in this, which is positive, but we need to prepare for what might happen.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament is very concerned about citizens and individuals.  This is a process that goes through the Parliament as well.  I think we have learned that lesson.  We need to understand the difficult challenge of maintaining a credit flow into the real economy if there is a build up of non-performing loans but we have the past to guide us.  There are aspects of the past, which the Deputy referenced and which I understand, that I would not like to see happen again.<\/p> <p>  This morning I received an email from a constituent who has a very severe problem so, like the Deputy, I am in direct contact with the real world.  I can assure him that everything we do here will be mindful of what happens in the real world and the emotional pain people experience when faced with a situation of not being able to repay loans.  Parliaments must have wider discussions on how to move from this current phase towards a recovery.  While at the moment there is a lot of money going out, member states' governments are supporting the real economy, the banks are there and the European Central Bank, ECB, is driving this policy, how and when that will change and how that will be managed.  These are issues I am very mindful of as well because I, like the Deputy, have first-hand knowledge and experience of constituents who lived with and are still living with very difficult situations because of the last financial crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I appreciate the comments made by the Commissioner.

Does she support the stance of the Commission to lodge an apple in the courts?<\/p><p>Am I right to presume the Commissioner has responsibility for insurance issues as they are part of financial services?  I am sure she is aware of a report by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, as it is the regulator of the industry at a European level.  What concerns, if any, does she have about the use of big data and big data analytics, BDA, tools by insurance companies as clearly shown in the EIOPA report?  The report states, &quot;Some insurance firms also track (public) social media posts for counter-fraud services&quot;, which I do not think anybody would have a major issue with.  The report also states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...provided either by specialist counter-fraud service or by specialised employees not necessarily with the use of BDA tools.  Some firms also reportedly use the information provided by web analytics tools and social media listening tools for analysis of user behaviour and for pricing and underwriting purposes. <\/blockquote><p>The report goes on to say that artificial intelligence and machine learning has been developed and is used by insurance companies to read information, pictures and videos from social media, which they use to price their insurance policies.  This is part of dual pricing and of how insurance companies are using big data to push up premiums and charge the highest they can.  What concern does the Commissioner have about the fact that anybody listening to this conversation is probably unaware that an image they post on their social media or a video of them on a family holiday may be used by some of the largest insurance companies in Ireland to determine how far they can push up their premium before they move or shop around?

As it pertains to her portfolio, what may come about after 31 December in terms of the strategy for European Union financial services, given the opportunities and challenges that Brexit presents?  Where can EU member states fill the gap or begin to compete with the City of London?  I will come back to the second question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#D00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question and his kind words.  On the general Brexit point, much of the focus is on the trade agreement and the withdrawal agreement.  Of course, there is an impact on the financial sector.  At the moment and when the UK was part of the EU, London was our financial centre and a very large one.  There were other centres but London was a major one.<\/p> <p>  In the process of Brexit, we have looked at areas where there were risks to financial stability that might impact us.  We have made decisions in a limited number of areas to protect financial stability.  This is done through equivalence decisions.  We give equivalence, so in other words, what is happening in the UK is equivalent to the EU in areas of significance to us in the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy points to a wider question.  Come 1 January, when the UK is a third country, London will still be a major financial centre.  There is then a question for us to look at in greater detail for the future.  Is it appropriate that the European Union would be reliant on a major financial centre in a third country which we are not the regulator of?  Already there is some movement of businesses and assets from London because of this, although not to a significant extent yet.  There might have been an expectation that things would work out.  We have asked the United Kingdom in a range of areas to provide answers to particular questions relating to making decisions about where they intend to be in the future and how that will sit with our rule book around financial services.  We continue to look for that information.  As of now, the passporting which UK firms could, because they were part of the European Union, operate across borders in the EU will go.  There will be significant change.<\/p> <p>  On the specifics of the Deputy's question about opportunities, that has to be answered by the member states looking at what they want in terms of financial stability for the European Union.  Some believe we need one centre within the European Union.  Perhaps that is not necessary in a more digital world.  There may be room for other centres, but we have to ask ourselves a question about whether we want to be overly reliant on the City of London when it comes to the entire financial sector.  There are potentially opportunities there.  There are many who want to hold everything within the City of London.  Perhaps it goes back to the general point I made that a member state is part of everything that goes with being a member state.  If a state opts out, there are consequences to that.  There are consequences for the City of London which players and stakeholders there are well aware of. <\/p> <p>  There will be an issue if there is no deal.  Tensions arise when negotiations take place.  Trust can be strained.  If there is no deal, it makes life that little bit more difficult in terms of the relationships we would have, at least in the short term.  The issue of the financial services coming from the City of London will come home to us to be dealt with in greater detail from 1 January onwards.  We have taken decisions where it was necessary and we are watching other areas.  The committee will be aware that the UK has granted a number of equivalents to the European Union in areas that it felt were important, but we have not reciprocated because they are not areas of significance from an EU perspective.  It is an area with potential opportunities and challenges and we need to be aware of both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I agree with the Commissioner.

Will she touch on the legislative responsibilities of member states?  This State has had difficulty in transposing directives into domestic legislation.  We had a debate in the D&aacute;il before the summer recess in this area.  There is scope for co-operation and co-ordination, not just between member states, but by increasing the EU approach.  The Commissioner mentioned Europol.  Brexit will present a challenge in this area.  I know we are starting to move away from her direct responsibility into the area of justice and home affairs when it comes to transferring of assets, cash and cryptocurrencies around the EU between nefarious organisations.

It goes back to the point I made about the evolution of the digital era in finance, which has been accelerated by Covid-19.  There are many innovative fintech companies starting up, which is positive.  Equally, with the speed at which this has happened and cryptocurrencies have been established, we have to regulate stronger and better to avoid such issues.

That perhaps puts more emphasis at EU level on investigating what a digital euro might look like and what its impact would be.  The current timetable is for the ECB to come to, at least, an initial decision by the summer of next year because other major players globally are doing work on digital currencies.  I cannot see it happening for a couple of years, but it is something that we need to be on top of.  There is a working group within the Commission that works with the ECB on this topic.

Like all companies, banks have been affected by Covid, but the situation needs to be put in a certain context.  For the decade running up to the Covid situation, bank profits were rising.  There were significant bank profits year on year for a decade.  For example, in 2019, nearly 15% of all dividends paid out by European companies were paid out by banks.  Covid affected them earlier this year but, from what I can see, they have been making a good recovery since then.  For example, in the third quarter of this year, BNP Paribas made net quarterly profits of &euro;1.9 billion.  On the other hand, the situation for bank workers has not been as good.  Some 60,000 jobs were lost in 2019 and 50,000 branches were shut in the decade from 2008 to 2018.  That has been reflected in Ireland.  Members of the committee met representatives of the bank workers' trade union recently and were given information about the situation in Ulster Bank.  Some &euro;3.5 billion in dividends has been paid from Ulster Bank to NatWest since 2016, but now 3,000 jobs and 88 branches - the entire network - are on the line as a result of the NatWest review.  In the Irish banking sector as a whole, there are 6,000 jobs on the line.  I believe the profits that have been made or are being made by banks should be invested back into jobs, services and a better society.

He covered a significant amount of ground.  I will deal with his specific question at the end of my response.  Financial institutions were not exactly banned from giving out dividends.  Strict guidelines stating it would not be appropriate in the context of the Covid-19 crisis were put in place.  As I stated in response to another member, we do not know how this crisis will evolve.  We are concerned that if, for example, there is an increase in infections and perhaps further restrictions after Christmas, that will have a further dampening effect on economic activity and more guidance may well be issued.  What will happen is not fixed in stone.  We know that banks were asked to abide by the guidance.  They have stuck with the guidance and advice not to pay dividends.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second specific question relates to Ulster Bank, etc.  I am aware of that issue.  I have been contacted by the unions involved and I will be meeting them for a full briefing on this issue.  The issue of bank closures is ongoing and long-standing.  It is, perhaps, partly due to the reality of the situation.  I am not sure if any of my adult children ever go to a bank branch.  I think there is a generational issue.  I was very familiar with bank branches when I was younger, but many people today use their phone or whatever to make transactions.  I acknowledge that it has been difficult for workers in the banking sector.  If the future evolves in such a way that we all use fewer physical infrastructures such as bank branches and instead use more technologically driven structures, that will have consequences for the workers or the number employed in banks.  The Deputy can rest assured that I will be listening directly to the trade unions concerned which will provide me with the full information.  Obviously, the Commission cannot interfere in a decision by a bank to do what it wishes to do.  I am not yet clear from the information I currently have whether a decision has been taken to sell off or close down.  I am not clear in that regard from what I have read thus far.

As Commissioner McGuinness is aware, the Commission previously identified Ireland as one of the member states with tax rules that are used by companies to engage in aggressive tax planning.  In July, Commissioner Gentiloni proposed using Article 116 of the EU treaty for tax policy purposes.  The article allows the Commission to move against member states that distort market competition.

What Commissioner Gentiloni stated and I support is that if there cannot be a global agreement, the Commission will come forward with proposals.  This comes from a sense within society that very large corporates have the capacity to move in order to benefit from various tax regimes.  We have to watch what happens at the global level and then see where the Commission will move.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of fiscal rules, the Deputy asked whether we will go back to where we were or back to normal.  I am not sure of the exact term she used.  I do not think that post Covid we will go back to the way we were.  The pandemic has had significant impacts across society and not just in terms of the economy.  There is no plan as to when and how this current situation will unravel towards going back to any particular rule book, but we know that something will have to be done regarding what fiscal supports are made available and how long that can continue.  I do not have a blueprint or a clear answer on that issue.<\/p><p>When the crisis hit the Commission rightly provided as much flexibility as possible within the existing framework to allow member states to support businesses, individuals and employees so that the worst impacts would not hit.  We all know that without those supports across the member states we would be in a more difficult situation.  The President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has said very clearly on several occasions that member states should not unravel the supports sharply and that it needs to be done over time and very carefully.  I do not think there is a clear answer to that in terms of a timetable.  I refer to my point about non-performing loans.  We know that things will evolve.  We are hoping to manage the most difficult aspects of this, taking into account the reason behind the current pandemic, and to do it in a way that is appropriate.  We do have a framework which is more flexible now because of the pandemic but there is not a decision taken already that in six months we will go back to the way we were.  It will take a longer timeframe and greater analysis as to how we do return to some form of normality.  I reiterate that this pandemic has had a quite a profound affect not just on economies but on societies.  There will be a requirement to understand how communities are and how people have been affected.  Apart from the terrible tragedies of the numbers that have died across the European Union and in Ireland and the families that are grieving there are those other impacts we have already discussed here.  There is no clear deadline as to what and when things might happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for making herself available to the committee.

Currently, inter-bank interest rates are at an all time low yet mortgagors in Ireland are exposed to the third highest mortgage interest rate in the euro region.  What can the Commissioner's division within the Commission do to increase competition so that mortgagors in Ireland can get access to lower interest rates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#F00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I can be very swift on this question.  Completing banking union should help to provide more competition and to provide better mortgage rates for mortgage holders.  We do not set those interest rates.  There are different rates across Europe.  As the Deputy said, Ireland's is the third highest so there are two countries above us.  The mandate I have been given and that I am working on is to try to move forward banking union in order that we can have a sector that is cross-border.  It is impossible or really difficult to get a loan for something in one member state financed by a bank in another.  These are barriers to the free movement of capital and banking services.  It will take some time to crack the idea of a banking union.  That is where we will see, I would hope, movement on this particular issue around mortgage interest rates.  <\/p> <p>  One of the Deputies referenced bank profitability.  Currently, interest rates are really low and there has been a very high increase in deposits because those who are in employment and continue to be paid are not spending due to the fact that shops were not open but equally because of uncertainty.  In some cases, negative interest rates are being paid on what they have in banks.  There is also a link to the wider remit of the capital markets union.  It would be preferable if we could have an investor confidence that savers would put money into enterprises and plan for their own future.  We do not have those flexibilities now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of my mandate from the President of the Commission my work and banking union and capital markets union should help us move in the direction of banking services being available across borders.  Currently, we have a very nationalised banking system.  It is extraordinary that despite the crisis we went through it is perhaps more nationalised now than we thought it would be following that particular crisis.  There is a lot of work to be done.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I congratulate the Commissioner on acquiring a portfolio that is very important and one that will grow in importance as time goes by.  I want to raise a couple of issues that are of particular interest, some of which have been already referred to by other speakers to some extent.  <\/p> <p>  The first is the issue raised by Deputy O'Callaghan in regard to high mortgage interest rates.  As the Commissioner will know, in the past anybody who borrowed in this country and throughout the European Union and did not keep up to date with their payments had penal interest rates imposed on them.  This meant they had no chance whatsoever of recovering or competing in the market in which they were operating.  They were condemned before they started and then they were blamed for what happened.<\/p> <p>  I have previously discussed the following issue with the Commissioner.  We are still recovering from the ripples of the financial crash in this country and we are still being punished for it, which I understand.  However, there is one thing that needs to be borne in mind.  Deputy Doherty mentioned the activities of vulture funds.  It is very seldom I agree with him, but I would agree with him on the points he made in that regard.  I have dealt with many of the vulture funds across the table in individual cases and I have been shocked.  Not all of them are the same.  I have been shocked at the way they treat people.  In many cases, when partners in a household were crying their eyes out in front of such people they got no response other than a glazed look at the middle distance, which clearly showed that they had no intention of even conceding.  <\/p> <p>  The primary lending institutions and the secondary lending institutions are applying current standards to a situation that they previously applied different standards to eight or ten years ago.  They are taking the view that the right way to do this is A, B and C.  They did not say that when they were lending to the people concerned.  In fact, they said the reverse.  A number of bankers from outside of this jurisdiction visited here to our cost because the undermined the stability of the market, all in pursuit of market share, as the Commissioner will know.  The result of that has been the withdrawal of many banks and the insurance companies as well.  They withdrew to their homelands and walked away with no responsibility good, bad or indifferent.  I blame the Central Bank of Ireland for allowing these things to happen, as I have done before and will do again.  I blame the European Central Bank, ECB, on which there was Irish representation from the Central Bank of Ireland for allowing these things to happen in this country and across Europe. <\/p> <p>  I know that the Commissioner's heart is in the right place and that there are other hearts in different locations across Europe.  My final point is in regard to the Apple case.  I profoundly disagree with Deputy Doherty's remarks in that regard.  I do not accept the case he put forward.  I had occasion to dispute this issue with a former Commissioner for Competition in this House a couple of years ago.  I believe there was an intention to discourage foreign direct investment in this country.  The way in which we were portrayed internationally has been very unhelpful, in pursuit of the single objective of winning the argument.  The depiction of the poor unfortunate donkey having a carrot dangled on a fishing rod in front of it comes to mind.  I was embarrassed to see the way that particular argument was emerging.  That is how it was.  Suffice it to say, we are responsible for taxation and manufacturing in our own country.  That should continue.  We should not under any circumstances allow a situation to develop whereby we are seen as a second, third, fourth or fifth option location for foreign direct investment in order to appease those who feel the investment should go to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#F00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I will not respond to the Deputy's comments on the Apple case.  I think it has been well argued on both sides.  I have made my intervention on that already.  To some extent, perhaps it needs to go to the final stage so that there is legal clarity.<\/p> <p>  On the second point in regard to the treatment of borrowers that run into difficulty, we have had a good exchange about that.  There is nobody in the room, online or physically, who does not have huge concerns about what happened in the past because we all know people who experienced difficulties.<\/p><p>I will make two points about this time.  One is that, where there are problems, there is an onus on both banks and borrowers to sit down together early and find solutions.  That would help alleviate an over-accumulation of non-performing loans.  When people are in financial distress they tend not to be able to cope.  It is a terrible place to be and I have dealt with many constituents in that position.  If there are situations where people know that their business is in a difficult place because of a public health crisis, my plea is that the banks and the borrower get together now.<\/p><p> On the wider issue, we have not heard and I would be interested if there can be a response.  The proposals and communication we will come forward with next week on non-performing loans have a twofold objective.  Primarily, it is to ensure we can continue the flow of credit into the economy from banks, which is essential, while also managing loans that are not being repaid and protecting the borrower.  We have learned lessons from the past.  I have referred to this and it is clear.  Deputy Durkan made the observation, and I hope I picked it up correctly, that sometimes people when they borrow are not aware of all the details of the loan, interest rates and so forth.  That allows me to refer to an issue on which I hope all members of the committee will support me.  It is backed up by research.  It is that when it comes to financial literacy, many of us do not understand the basic concepts in the financial world, even though we will deal with it on many occasions throughout our lives.  It is also true that one third of European households are financially fragile.  That means that where they face an unexpected crisis in their finances, they cannot cope with it.  There is a very vulnerable sector of our society that needs support on financial issues and financial literacy.  We are moving into a more digital world in which everything is instant and immediate.  Those of us who had a cheque book and a pen used to have to think, at least, because one was signing the cheque.  There is now a generation that does not even know what a cheque book is.  We now need to understand that we make more rapid financial decisions.  We make them instantly and we need to have knowledge in order that we have the power to make the right decisions.<\/p><p> It is one of my.priorities, a personal priority, to make the financial world more visible to the wider society and to develop a framework on financial literacy so member states can, if they choose, use this framework to make citizens more financially aware.  Clearly, education is the remit of each member state but when it comes to finance, we could do a great deal to improve financial literacy to help all of us to make better financial decisions and, perhaps, avoid some of the worst impacts when financial decisions turn out to be difficult or go in the wrong direction.  I would appreciate the committee's support for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I wish to add my voice to the voices of previous speakers when they spoke to the Commissioner about the activities of vulture funds in Ireland, and to underline the fact that they are causing devastation in society.  Her last point relating to financial literacy is central to what is happening.  The borrowers are now faced with dealing with a vulture fund and the language being used by the vulture funds is high-end financial language, which is poorly understood by those who are trying to engage in finding a solution to their problem with the vulture funds.  In addition, the vulture funds, by and large, ignore the regulation regarding the loan they have just purchased.  They put the borrower to great strain.  They are breaking businesses and individuals and they are repossessing farms.  We are losing a generation of entrepreneurs because of what they are doing.  People end up on the Irish Credit Bureau list and their future is damaged beyond repair.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Commissioner, in 2021, to put individuals at the centre of what she is doing.  They have suffered badly from the financial crash and from the ongoing financial difficulties they have experienced through the pandemic.  They now need a break.  It appears to me, from hearings at this committee over the past five years, that banks ignore them.  They pay lip service to the regulation.  I believe this country has a banking sector that is close to being out of control, and I do not say that lightly.  The Commissioner is meeting the Irish Financial Services Union regarding Ulster Bank.  It is shocking that 3,000 employees of that bank, through their representatives, cannot have a constructive meeting about the future of the bank and their jobs.  The customers are also worried.  It tells one a great deal about the attitude of banks, including the attitude of Ulster Bank to this Parliament, because its representatives will not turn up, and its attitude to trade unions, because it will not engage with them.  In the course of next year we are faced with that problem in Ulster Bank, 1,500 jobs in doubt in AIB and a further number of that type in Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  A great deal must be done by Europe to deal with financial literacy, on the one hand, and then to deal with the controls that are necessary on the mainstream banks to support those who are in mortgage difficulty and to provide mortgages, as Deputy O'Callaghan said, at a reasonable interest rate.  The Sparkasse bank model is often discussed in this committee in terms of its interest rates and the community nature of that bank.  I would love to see the Commission promoting the concept of community banking, to give people the opportunity to engage with that type of banking system.  It is far more sensitive to their needs than the vulture funds and the other banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020120900002#G00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I will respond briefly.  What the Chairman has just said is what I have said several times since taking up this position.  People have to be at the centre of what I do here.  The banking system relies on people.  The idea of financial literacy is something I personally intend to pursue.  I am glad to have spoken to an Oireachtas committee so it is aware of my interest in this.  We spoke earlier about the sensitivities at present and the trauma people suffered in the past and, potentially, will suffer again in this crisis.  I am well aware of that, perhaps because I have come through elections and I understand people and their position.  We also need to work towards solving some of these difficulties and helping people to get help early rather than let a problem build up, which is what often happens.  All of us have a responsibility to communicate, which I will be doing more directly next week when we launch our communication on non-performing loans.  We need a financial system that is competitive and meets the needs of citizens.  It is evolving rapidly.  The Chairman mentioned the threat to jobs in banks.  I am aware of this as well.<\/p> <p>  This is our first opportunity to engage and I welcome the comments.  I have taken note of them.  I am not 100 days in the job - I believe it is 60 days - so it is not too bad to have absorbed quite a heavy workload that was already in place but needs to be propelled further.  However, I live in a rural community and I understand the issues that affect people.  I listen more than I speak when I am out and about, if we ever get back to a place without masks.  I will understand and convey the sensitivities of not just Irish citizens but all European citizens when it comes to their dealings with the financial system.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we need a financial system that works.  It is vital for business and individuals.  It is my job to maintain that and to make it work better.  I hope I will have the help and support of elected members of all parliaments across the European Union to do that.<\/p><p>We are facing challenging times with the pandemic and a potential no-deal Brexit.

Yet, the performance of some cancer services is getting worse, not better, due to historical underfunding, lack of capacity in the system and an under-resourced and incomplete workforce.<\/p> <p>  Thankfully, this has been recognised by the Minister for Health and cancer services received substantial funding in the budget this year.  However, the scale of the challenge is immense.  While increased funding is vital, money alone will not solve all the problems.  Covid-19 has had a devastating effect on a system that for many years had insufficient capacity to be able to assure people that they would get diagnosed and treated for cancer as quickly as they should.  Insufficient hospital capacity, inbuilt inefficiencies and too few healthcare professionals along with an increase in cancer cases of between 3% and 4% annually has led to lengthy and growing waiting lists.  Longer waiting lists mean delays in diagnosis and treatment.  Delayed diagnosis and treatment can mean worse patient outcomes.  The truth is that, in Ireland, access to care is being rationed by waiting lists, and until these are eradicated, patient care and, sometimes, outcomes will be compromised.<\/p> <p>  I appeal to committee members to imagine being symptomatic but being unable to get timely access to a test to find out what is wrong.  This is the reality for thousands of people waiting for a diagnosis in Ireland.  For instance, we understand that there may be in excess of 100,000 people waiting for a radiology appointment.  This includes urgent, semi-urgent and routine waiters for ultrasound, CT and MRI tests.  The demand for radiology services is steadily rising at an annual increase of between 8% and 10%.  In the national cancer strategy, the vital role of radiology in diagnosing cancer was called out and the strategy document outlined that there are substantial deficiencies in access to such services.  In Ireland, recent reports have found that we have fewer radiologists and radiographers than is recommended by international best practice.  This has led to high workloads compared with peers in other countries and correspondingly high waiting lists for patients.<\/p> <p>  Timely access to cancer treatment is vital.  Yet, capital investment to expand capacity and infrastructure in many oncology day wards throughout the country was badly needed pre Covid.  Medical oncology was routinely working above capacity.  Now, the reduction in hospital occupancy capacity to 85% in line with clinical guidance on safe practice for patients and staff and the ongoing risk that staff will need to take Covid-19 leave puts further pressures on waiting lists.  Even if capacity is expanded, we doubt that additional staff are available.  In the case of surgical treatment, only seven in ten patients were able to get care within the appropriate timeframe up to the end of 2019.  Covid-19 has made accessing operating theatres more difficult, and timeframes from diagnosis to surgery are of particular concern to us.<\/p> <p>  One of the most critical key performance indicators in the national cancer strategy, which relates to the centralisation of surgery, will be missed at the end of this year.  Progress must be accelerated in this area.  We have previously called for protected surgical time for oncology cases and we believe the national cancer control programme needs to consider how to improve diagnosis-to-treatment timeframes.<\/p> <p>  Another area I wish to draw to the attention of committee members is genetic services.  Waiting lists exist at every point on the pathway for people who have or may have a genetic risk of cancer.  Currently, genetic services and the downstream services that are needed by patients are underdeveloped and under-resourced.  As well as the development of genetic services as envisioned in the national cancer strategy, we are keen to see the development of a dedicated pathway for breast cancer gene, BRCA, positive patients and an audited quality-assured screening programme for them.  More capacity needs to be created in downstream services so that a dedicated group of physicians can follow these patients and discuss options and psycho-oncology support.  Patients have told us that the lack of capacity is illustrated by the fact that if they choose to have risk-reducing surgery, some women cannot be given a date for when reconstruction can happen.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, great cancer care is intertwined with cancer research.  Research is the driving force for ongoing improvement in cancer outcomes and motivates hope among patients and the world-class experts who give them care in this country.  Yet, the metrics suggest that research activity is significantly declining rather than growing.  Some of the issues I have illustrated are related to a lack of investment in capital infrastructure and service development.  Equally, the challenges associated with the cancer workforce are a significant threat to the success of the national cancer strategy.  The implementation of many recommendations is wholly reliant on having enough staff with the right skills and access to the best equipment to deliver cancer services.  Healthcare professionals underpin the success of the entire strategy.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Cancer Society believes that there has never been a more urgent time to focus on cancer services.  We are grateful for the funding injection into cancer services that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, announced as part of budget 2021.  We believe it will be one element of the many that are needed to build a strong and resilient cancer service.<\/p> <p>  I thank committee members for remaining focused on the performance of cancer services and for acknowledging the major challenges that have built up over a considerable period.  Committee members have refocused political attention so that cancer does not become the forgotten C during the pandemic.  Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on all of our lives.  When it comes to cancer, however, it is the things we do today and the measures we put in place here and now that will decide the ultimate impact of this pandemic on our cancer outcomes.<\/p><p>I said we are in the business of hope.  Together all stakeholders - patients, healthcare professionals, representative groups, members of Government and Members of the Oireachtas - need to turn hope into action.  We do this by demanding improvements, listening to and learning from experts, putting in place best practice and making sure we have efficient, well-funded and well-staffed cancer services.  I firmly believe that everyone here today can play a role in achieving that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#A01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Morrogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to meet with it to discuss cancer care and screening services.  I have been the director of the national cancer control programme since the end of July 2020.  I will begin by discussing the effect of Covid-19 on the symptomatic cancer services and then outline some future developments.<\/p> <p>  In common within many other countries, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on cancer services in Ireland.  The maintenance of cancer services during the pandemic has been prioritised by the HSE, the Department of Health and the Government.  Early in the pandemic, the national cancer control programme, NCCP, led a co-ordinated response on behalf of the cancer services.  Close engagement between clinicians from key disciplines addressing difficult clinical questions and facilitating the urgent need for the development of national guidelines helped to deliver safe services and maximise survival in an extremely uncertain environment.  Communication with primary and community care and with the public at large was prioritised to ensure clear messaging on the availability of safe cancer services.  <\/p> <p>  As Ms Morrogh mentioned, this has been a very difficult period for cancer patients and their families.  To mitigate the risk to their care in a Covid environment, the cancer services have enabled as much care as possible to take place outside the acute hospital setting while ensuring robust infection prevention and control measures are in place to ensure patient safety within the hospital setting.  The NCCP, the Irish Cancer Society and Cancer Care West established a virtual psych-oncology service called Together 4 Cancer Concern to address the real problem of anxiety and worry facing many cancer patients.  The Department of Health funded 26 acute oncology nurses to help ensure those patients on cancer treatment avoided emergency departments and stayed outside hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic required adapting diagnostic and treatment pathways to ensure patient and staff safety.  The impact of these measures has unavoidably reduced capacity.  However, staff in the cancer services have responded with great dedication and agility and have adopted measures to optimise triage, pre-screen patients, utilise telemedicine, make local infrastructural changes, alter locations of diagnosis or treatment and increase capacity using extended days and additional weekend clinics.  I sincerely thank all the staff for their unstinting efforts on behalf of cancer patients during what was a very challenging time in the health services.<\/p> <p>  We are continuing to optimise capacity in the cancer services in a safe manner and would encourage people with symptoms suspicious of cancer to consult their GP so they can be referred for appropriate investigation.  During the initial pandemic wave, there was a reduction in cancer presentations and referrals; in attendances at rapid access clinics for breast, lung and prostate cancers; and in the number of patients undergoing treatment.  Reduced cancer presentations were likely related to an understandable fear with regard to Covid infection and a response to the restrictions in place at that time.  Since then there has been a gradual recovery in all metrics, a recovery which has continued despite the second autumn pandemic wave.  There was a decrease in the number of cancers diagnosed at the rapid access clinics during the first wave.  There has, however, been an increase since then and at the end of September, the year to date number of primary cancers diagnosed at these clinics was approximately 90% compared to 2019.  It is expected that this percentage figure will continue to increase for the remainder of the year with a consequent reduction in the number of \"lost cancer diagnoses\".<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Health has allocated a total of &euro;34.35 million to the NCCP in the winter pandemic plan and the national service plan for 2021.  This is a marked increase in funding compared to recent years and is greatly welcomed by all in the cancer services.  The funding will be used in two key areas: increasing resilience in the current cancer services; and progressing key elements of the cancer strategy.<\/p> <p>  Experience during the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of welcome new initiatives in the cancer services that will require further consolidation.  These include the increasing use of ICT in the delivery of care and the optimisation of diagnostic and treatment pathways to reduce footfall in the acute hospital setting.  Increasing clinic efficiencies using various streamed pathways for patient care will be progressed.  Staffing resilience will be improved through additional recruitment and optimising skill mix.  It must be noted, however, that the greatest threat to resilience in the cancer services in the short to medium term is increased community transmission of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  With regard to progressing cancer strategy 2017-2026, the priorities for 2021 will include the progression of cancer prevention initiatives; improved access to diagnostics for all cancer patients; addressing the increasing and more complex demand for radiation oncology, including the provision of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy; further centralisation of cancer surgery to ensure safe, quality care for patients; enhancing medical oncology services to meet the growing complexity and demand; development of appropriate models of care for rare cancers; further development of the cancer genetics and molecular diagnostic services and improved services in the hereditary cancer programme; continued development of survivorship services, including psycho-oncology services, to improve the quality of life of those living with and beyond cancer; and supporting a research culture in the cancer services, including promoting clinical and academic collaboration.<\/p> <p>  In summary, Covid-19 has posed significant challenges to cancer services in 2020, particularly during the first pandemic wave, with a significant increase in activity since then.  The recent significantly increased funding for cancer services will allow us to increase resilience in the current services while progressing key cancer strategy priorities in 2021.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Riste&aacute;rd &Oacute; Laoide"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems throughout the world in a way that was inconceivable this time last year.  In March, when we knew very little about Covid, screening services internationally played their part by pausing their programmes in order to prevent infection based on best public health advice.  Since then, we have assessed the risks of delivering screening in a Covid environment and have put in place measures to reduce these risks.<\/p> <p>  In restarting cervical screening, we are focused on managing capacity across the whole screening pathway so that people get their results and any follow-up assessment in a timely manner.  CervicalCheck resumed screening on 6 July by prioritising inviting the longest waiters to reduce the risk of the people delayed.  By the end of December 2020, we will have issued a first invite letter to everyone due screening in 2020.  We issued more than 270,000 invites in 2020 and screened more than 117,000 people in primary care.<\/p> <p>  While the global demand for Covid-19 testing has put pressure on laboratory supplies internationally, our laboratory is continuing to meet our capacity needs.  For women, this translates into approximately 80% of result letters being issued within six weeks of the test.  We continue to appeal for people to book their test when invited.<\/p> <p>  We have been asked how the pressures of the global pandemic will affect the people we care for in screening.  These concerns are also our concerns.  While we continue to work to minimise the impact of Covid-19 on screening, evidence shows that because of the typically slow progression of cervical cancer - over five to 15 years - the beneficial outcomes do not reduce if screening is delayed for six months.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of screening is to improve population outcomes for the condition being screened for.  In CervicalCheck, that is decreasing the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer.  We do this by assessing risk in individuals and referring those with a higher than normal risk for further assessment in colposcopy.  All screening programmes involve finding a balance between their benefits and potential harm.  Our rigorous quality assurance systems ensure the programme meets the highest international standards and keeps risks as low as is possible.  <\/p> <p>  Our new primary HPV screening programme will lead to a temporary increase in referrals to colposcopy in year two.  We have investment in place to grow our colposcopy provision.  However, we must also work with the HSE national women and infants programme to ensure capacity is created in the gynaecology service for women with symptoms who may previously but erroneously have been sent to colposcopy for quicker access to gynaecology services.<\/p><p>We are concerned when we hear people from all walks of life confuse screening services with diagnostic services, and we welcome the opportunity to talk to the committee about this today.<\/p><p> In March of this year, the HPV test was introduced as the primary cervical screening method. It brought CervicalCheck in line with international best practice in cervical screening.  With HPV screening we are testing for a different risk factor in the development of cervical cancer: the presence of the human papillomavirus, that is, HPV.<\/p><p> We know that HPV screening is better at predicting which women are at risk of developing cancer but it will not detect everyone.  No screening programme will pick up all potential cancer cases; none is designed to do so.  When a potential case of cancer is not detected in screening, this does not mean that the screening test has failed.  It illustrates the boundaries of the test.  Furthermore, when these women go on to get cancer and their cytology slides are reviewed retrospectively, there is a four in ten chance that abnormalities will be seen that were not seen at the time of screening.  This is called retrospective bias.  It is important that as a society we acknowledge this uncomfortable truth.<\/p><p> The National Cancer Screening Laboratory, NCSL, build will begin in January 2021.  In time, it will become the principal provider of cervical screening laboratory services.  For now, a high-quality laboratory service continues to be delivered by Quest Laboratories in the US.<\/p><p> We are grateful that GPs and practice nurses are continuing to fulfil their important role as key sample takers for CervicalCheck.  We thank our colposcopy colleagues who, during the pause in screening, continued to work hard to reduce the waiting list that had resulted from the issues affecting CervicalCheck in 2018.  Our colposcopy turnaround times are continuing on target.<\/p><p> In October, the National Screening Service, NSS, welcomed the publication of the expert reference groups&rsquo; interval cancer reports.  These reports were commissioned as part of the Scally review in 2018 and their publication marks the completion of 113 of the 116 Scally report actions.  The reports acknowledged that Ireland&rsquo;s cancer screening programmes operate to the highest international standards.  They emphasise, however, that every year there will be people who develop interval cancers.  This is a difficult diagnosis for people to receive.  We are now working to implement those recommendations in full.  We plan to consult widely with patients and their doctors about the future process.  Finally, we are grateful to the many patient representatives who voluntarily give up their time to support our screening programmes this year at an especially difficult time.  We remain committed to having patients at the centre of our screening programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Russell.

Regarding the capacity to deal with increased referrals, will we have a sufficient number of people with the expertise to deal with it?

I will start by addressing his first point about capacity in colposcopy.  Year two of the programme will commence in the middle of next year so from June onwards in 2021.  We are delighted to have secured &euro;2 million in extra funding for colposcopy services for 2021.<\/p> <p>  One of the key points we are planning for closely with the national women and infants programme is to ensure we increase capacity in gynaecology services.  Currently, one third of women who are referred into colposcopy clinics are referred in because of symptoms.  Those women would be more appropriately and holistically assessed if they attended rapid access gynaecology clinics under the care of the national women and infants programme.  That would free up capacity in the colposcopy clinics to look after women who screen positive and need further investigation. <\/p> <p>  As I said, we are delighted to have received funding and we are working collaboratively because it is actually a small community in Ireland who have the necessary skills to provide colposcopy.  We need to ensure we match the capacity of women's needs and make sure we have the appropriate healthcare professionals to see them.  It is, however, absolutely key that women who have symptoms, first, do not delay presenting to their GP.  They must be seen urgently and assessed and the GPs and primary care specialists must have an avenue of rapid access to gynaecology clinics for women with symptoms.

As he said, 26 cancer nurses were employed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  These were employed specifically to ensure patients avoided the emergency department in what was an uncertain environment in the hospitals.  They have proven exceedingly valuable because they work with the patients in the community and liaise with the GP, and really, direct patients away from the hospital and deal with any acute problems that arise from them.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, we have received a significant amount of funding this year, as I outlined in my opening statement.

That work indicates that the reduction was not as great as we had thought.  Between March and June of this year, when one includes the private sector numbers, the reduction is 12.5%.  Surgery is now back at 90% to 100% capacity.  Obviously it slowed because of pretesting for surgery, prescreening and cocooning but we have clear Covid and non-Covid pathways in the hospitals.  At the moment, there are effectively no waiting lists for surgical oncology in most of the centres.  Some local deviation takes place because one of the main issues for capacity at the moment is transmission of Covid-19.

We hope that with the introduction of a vaccine and the reduction in requirements for restrictions in 2021, we will be able to increase capacity further.  We have had funding allocated to us to increase our number of mobile and static units.  We have been lucky in our staff response as a number of staff have agreed to take on additional hours and provide additional capacity.  For example, in the west, where until now we have maybe only had screening three days per week, we were up to five and even six days in recent weeks.

In bowel cancer, for instance, evidence published this month on a European study of over 200,000 patients with a positive fecal immunochemical test, FIT, showed that a delay of up to nine months did not have a negative impact on their outcome.

The majority of newly approved cancer drugs are required to be accompanied by a comparison molecular diagnostic test.<\/p> <p>  The cancer strategy suggested we put in place a national implementation framework for molecular diagnostic testing so it is provided in a co-ordinated and standardised way.  To date, the investment has not been put in place for molecular diagnostics, although we in the NCCP have set up a framework to look at molecular diagnostics as it relates to drugs and the provision of drugs, where the test is important in deciding whether the drugs should be given to a patient.  Some of this testing is currently done in Beaumont Hospital and St. James's Hospital but there are a number of other centres doing molecular diagnostic testing.  The NCCP is focused on putting a framework in place so we have a network which optimises the provision of these molecular diagnostics because they change quickly.

Where the day care units were not sufficiently separated in the hospitals, they were transferred to the private sector.<\/p> <p>  The second area was in surgical oncology.  Again, because at the time there was a significant concern and we had seen what had happened in northern Italy, a lot of the theatre capacity and the ICU capacity was being kept for Covid patients and the potential Covid wave we were expecting.

There are challenges to find ways to ensure we pick up the early signs and symptoms in patients who can present to general practice and diagnostic services earlier and quicker to ensure these patients can be diagnosed at an earlier stage and have a better chance of successful treatment.

Young people have been bombarded with public health messages about Covid, for example, they are told not to go near people.  I am worried that not many women availed of the offer to engage with cervical screening services when they resumed recently.  A former Minister for Health expressed a hope that human papillomavirus or HPV would be eliminated in the coming years.  When young people do not engage with screening services to the greatest extent possible it is a major public health issue.  I engage with many young people and I am concerned that there is still a stigma among a lot of young women in their mid-20s about smear tests.  They believe they are too young to worry about screening or choose to wait because their lives are too busy.  What steps are being taken to encourage young people, particularly young women, to get tested?<\/p> <p>  A recent survey by the Irish Cancer Society found that approximately one in four respondents did not attend a GP or a hospital appointment when it was necessary.  Of those who did not attend, three in ten decided to wait because they did not believe the issue was sufficiently serious.  Further, one in four respondents did not attend because they were afraid of catching Covid-19 and 23% did not want to bother their GPs.  All of those are terribly Irish reasons not to attend.  Has Covid-19 affected people's perception of whether they need to attend a doctor?

I will respond on the messaging about HPV and what we did when the programme changed last March.  We had a full campaign that had been worked up and was ready to go.  We were ready to launch our new improved cervical screening programme, moving from a cytology-based service to primary HPV, but it coincided with the Covid pandemic.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, there was a great deal of messaging at the time.  We decided, therefore, not to launch our full campaign in March.  As such, while we changed the programme, we are behind in the messaging about HPV.<\/p> <p>  Since we restarted on 6 July, we have been running a campaign to inform women about the new primary HPV programme.  We have had significant uptake in recent months.  November was a bumper month for the cervical screening programme.  We expected to screen 21,000 women but 24,000 women attended for screening.  The Senator is right.  Initially, we were worried that women would not respond to their invitations to attend cervical screening but women are attending in huge numbers and we are delighted with that.  Again, that is thanks to the screeners, GPs and practice nurses who carry out these screening tests for us.  We have that engagement.  Our public health awareness programme, which involves media campaigns and advertisements, is up and running.  We plan to do more of that in the future. <\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question about young women, she is correct in this regard.  We know that 25-year-olds have a lot going on in their lives and their first screening test is not always top of their priority list.  Our communications team is working on that engagement.

We are always looking for new ways to engage with younger women about the programme so we would be delighted to consider any suggestions the Senator may have.<\/p> <p>  As to whether there has been a change in how people react to healthcare, there has been an incredible amount of fear over the last year.  We have seen that with all healthcare services across the world so it is not just an Irish issue.  People were terrified to go into healthcare settings because of the risk of catching Covid-19.  We know a lot more now than we did in March and we are a lot clearer about how to reduce the risk.  What we are seeing now is people re-engaging with healthcare.  We need to keep working on this issue but I am confident from a CervicalCheck point of view that women are re-engaging with the service.

When we speak about screening programmes, and I will speak specifically to CervicalCheck, we know that when we screen 1,000 women, within them there would be 20 women with a risk factor for developing cervical cancer, and screening with cytology or smear tests would detect 15 from those 20, or 75% of women with that risk factor.  Screening with primary HPV will detect 18 from 20 women with that risk factor or 90%.  There is no screening test for cervical cancer that detects all women at risk.  There will always be women with a screening test that is negative but who will go on to develop a cancer.<\/p> <p>  As a clinician, I have been in the room with such women and it is devastating to receive that diagnosis.  These are women who have done everything right, gone for their screening test and followed up where asked but who still went on to get cancer.  That is a really hard diagnosis to get.  We know from international literature and the reviews of the CervicalCheck programme that when we look back on the slides for women who were screened and go on to develop cancer, there is a four in ten chance we would see a different result looking back than was seen at the time of screening.  That is the reality of what a review is likely to reveal.  That is retrospective bias.

It is appreciated.  Before I ask my questions, I will add my voice to urge and encourage women to use the CervicalCheck cancer screening.  Despite all the media reports and questions around it, the programme plays a valuable role in protecting women's lives.<\/p> <p>  I recently received a reply to a parliamentary question which showed that 231 legal cases related to CervicalCheck have been launched in recent times.  That is shocking in many ways.  The T&aacute;naiste told us that women would not have to go through the court system to achieve justice in this regard and we have been long promised a tribunal to deal with this matter but it is still not in place.  The Government stated that women had been wronged and rightly apologised for that.  The courts have also stated that women had been wronged.  A long list of doctors have stated that certain slides were misread.  There were flashing red lights that should have been seen when those slides were read in the first instance, but that did not happen.  While I agree with the clinical director of CervicalCheck that there is always a significant margin of error in screening and that is part of the process, there is a Government policy and a court decision that notes that there have also been difficulties outside of that margin of error, as such.<\/p> <p>  I received a letter from CervicalCheck in the past couple of weeks and had a conversation with its clinical director.  I was taken by surprise that CervicalCheck seems to have a different view on this from the Government and the courts and it does not believe that women have been wronged and that the courts have adjudicated correctly.  I am worried about that because it has an effect on the women who have gone through the system and received an apology.  I am also concerned about other problems that we may find within society.  There may be other women, outside the normal margin of error, who had their slides misread and are currently asymptomatic.  If we carried out a sample reading look-back on those slides, we might be able to ensure that lives are protected and people get diagnoses and receive treatment faster.  The reason I came to this view was as a result of the very sad case of Ms Patricia Carrick, God rest her.  She did not have cancer at the time of a look-back so her case was not read.  I will perhaps ask the clinical director of CervicalCheck if there is not a danger here if different elements of the State have radically different opinions on the matter.  Does that difference of opinion not make it difficult for us then to ensure that we proceed with a look-back on other samples?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#K00800","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  It is nice to chat to him about these things again.  I think he and I had a productive conversation last week where we agreed that we have a common goal of rebuilding trust in our world-class screening programme.  I have been a doctor on the front line and given that information to a woman who has been screened and goes on to get a cancer diagnosis.  We all agree that it is a challenging and difficult place to be, as a woman, and it is worse still if that woman believes that somebody did not do their job right and that is why she is getting this diagnosis.  However, as a clinician, I can tell the committee that a smear screening test will never detect all cancers.  Every year, on the CervicalCheck programme, there will be women who have an interval cancer, meaning they will develop cancer after a normal screening test.<\/p><p>That is a reality.  It will happen next year and it is happening this year, because screening will never detect all cancers.  Internationally, few countries carry out reviews.  When Public Health England reviewed slides for women who got cancer, four in ten women had an abnormality detected on look-back that was not seen on review.  What we have found is very helpful is the Supreme Court ruling, which clarified that absolute confidence does not mean 100% detection.  That is really important.  The Supreme Court clarified that a new standard has not been introduced and that screening tests are not expected to detect 100% of cancers because, of course, that is impossible.  The court also outlined in great detail the reasons a competent screener could be doing his or her job to the best of his or her ability with the tools he or she has, and a cancer may still not be detected.  That was outlined in great detail in the Supreme Court and it is very welcome for cancer screening services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Russell for that answer but it does not get to the key issue.

The fact remains that no cervical screening programme in the world detects 100% of cervical cancers.  There are interval cancers in every cervical cancer screening programme in the world.  That is a straightforward fact.  I am delighted the Deputy is raising these questions because they are questions for broader Irish society.  Do we accept as a society that we continue with screening because, for the majority, it reduces the risk of developing cancer?  If we do that, we have to acknowledge there will be women who are screened for cervical cancer, have a negative result and go on to get cancer.  That is the minority, but it is really tough for a woman if she ends up in that minority.  We as a society have to decide how we look after women in that minority.<\/p> <p>  We also have to decide whether we will treat some people with cancer differently from others.  Every year, as we have heard from Ms Morrogh, 24,000 people in Ireland are diagnosed with cancer.  The majority of these people, approximately 22,600, are diagnosed with cancer when they get symptoms.  Some 1,400 people are diagnosed with cancer on a screening programme.

The State has acknowledged there is another section of women, outside of the margin of error, whose cases should have been picked up.  The reason I raise this issue is that some of those women will not have a look-back until they are diagnosed with cancer, such as Patricia Carrick.  For those women, it may be too late to carry out the necessary treatment to protect their lives.  I suggested we would take a sample of those asymptomatic women and determine whether there are mistaken readings.  \"Missed opportunities\", \"mistaken readings\", \"red lights\": these are not my words but those of the doctors who have given evidence in court cases relating to the matter.

The Deputy's question about whether we should perform a review of all the women who have received a normal result is the exact same thing as screening, and screening will never find all the women with cancer.  The same test can be performed over and over again, and the women can be screened and rescreened, but it takes away valuable resources from screening the women who were due to be screened to look back and rescreen women who have been screened.

It was not that it was identified but that it should have been.  I realise that is a very difficult conclusion to come to, from a diagnostics point of view, but the courts came to that decision and medical evidence was adduced in court to the effect that on the look-back, there was evidence that cancer should have been recognised but that it was not recognised.<\/p> <p>  The other issue was that the patients in many cases were not informed.

A number of those cases, I imagine and hope, will go through the CervicalCheck tribunal, which started on 1 December, and people have started to put those claims through.  It will be very useful for all of us to see the outcome of the tribunal and the results that come through.  To date, relatively few cases have gone to court.  Some have been settled before they went there.  It is always the State Claims Agency's intention to use mediation to prevent people having to go to court if they can, although a few tragic cases have gone through the High Court and had their evidence assessed.  There is not a medical intervention known to us that has not on occasion been found to be negligent, but they are very small numbers.  We do not anticipate that all 230 cases that are going through now will show evidence of negligence.  As Dr. Russell outlined, the unfortunate reality of a test that is not perfect is much better now, thank goodness.  Even at that, however, interval cancers will continue to come through in future.  Our concern is how we try to avoid people going to court in future.  Patients rightly say they hate it and doctors do not like it either.<\/p><p>We have to find some other way of thinking about and addressing the issue that we will continue to have interval cancers.  One of the good things about screening is that we repeat it regularly.  In the case of cervical screening, for example, anyone who tests positive now for HPV will come back for another test a year later and then go on to have cytology.  We call people back on a two-, three- or five-year schedule, depending on their risk levels, so the chance is always there that if the cancer is not picked up on the first screen, it might be picked up on the second.  Because these are generally slow-growing cancers, we will often pick up the cancer at a later point.  Over the course of the next cycle or round of screenings - in other words, from 2018 until now - all the women who were called previously will be called again this time.  Therefore, a patient's call for looking back at those will be done anyway because we will recall and look at everybody's screen.  If they come for screening, we will look at their tests again over this round.  Once this round is finished, we will start the next round.  We do repeat screening all the time, so I do not see a benefit in taking a further sample.  If we are talking about one or two per 1,000 who might have an abnormality that we have failed to pick up, there is a risk that either we will do that again in the subsequent screening, as Dr. Russell said, or that the numbers will be so small that they will be impossible to find, unless we repeat the entire round, which we are already doing.  Screening is a complicated system, but I hope we can offer some reassurance that by repeating and screening regularly we increase the chance of finding anything that perhaps was not found in a previous round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I wish to come in on just one point Deputy Durkan made.

I co-chair the project board with the master of the Coombe, where the new screening laboratory is being built.  Just today, I think, the next step of that is being considered by the Coombe board, and we hope to start building in January, with the intention that we will open up the laboratory in mid-2022.  Our biggest rate-limiting step for that is, as we have mentioned a few times this morning, making sure we have the staff in place and that there is an adequately trained workforce available, but we have good plans in place towards that.<\/p> <p>  As to where we send all our samples, our ambition is that the new laboratory will become the main provider of screening in Ireland.  We will always need a backup, both from the point of view of resilience and to ensure we build in a safety mechanism to make sure we always have somewhere to send samples.  We have not yet chosen where that backup will be.  That will be a discussion for us with the Coombe.  We may have a joint agreement with another laboratory but we will have a backup, and I am very confident that that backup, if it continues with Quest, will be very safe for patients in Ireland.  We have now had three different reviews of CervicalCheck, including a review of the laboratories and a review of Quest in the US.  We personally conduct quality assurance visits to Quest, or at least we will do so again once we are able to travel to America, and we are very assured of the quality of the process it provides for us.  Its rate of detection is similar to that of every other laboratory across the world.  I would have no hesitation continuing with Quest if that is the route we go down in a few years.

A number of Members still want to contribute, but I want to ask a couple of questions myself.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Cancer Society talked about people receiving life-changing news alone.  I myself have been in that position, like Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, in that I have got that difficult information and was told I had cancer.  Can anything be done about this, bearing in mind we are dealing with a pandemic?  Is there anything that can soften that blow or is there some other way of giving that information?  I presume it is being given over the phone at present.  Are the witnesses looking at this?  Is there any way of doing it?<\/p> <p>  Second is the issue of the financial cost of cancer.  We have a drugs payment scheme, but for many of those who have had or who have cancer the difficulty is that they first have to reach that ceiling, but many of the things one might need are not covered by the scheme.  Perhaps the Irish Cancer Society representatives might talk about the real cost of not only the psychological and physical impact of cancer but also its financial impact.  Is there anything they feel they need to say about that?<\/p> <p>  Finally, it is usually around this time of year in November and December that we talk about men's health.  Are there any discussions ongoing in that regard?  We know that men, particularly men of a certain age, do not talk about their issues, but it is important that people go forward and get tested.  Is there any possibility of a screening programme, a proactive campaign, to get men in for screening, particularly for prostate cancer, although not solely for that?  That would be important.<\/p> <p>  Those few questions probably need to be addressed.  Before the witnesses come back in, I wish to thank all the staff they represent, particularly those in the HSE, for their dedication and commitment.  They turn up every day and have done so during the pandemic, often at great risk to themselves and their families.  It is important we as a committee say that and that we learn from mistakes.  One of the things I noticed during my time attending was that many of the appointments were at the same time.  I would get an appointment for 9.30 a.m. and another 40 people would turn up at the same time, or I would get an appointment for 2.30 p.m. and there would be another 40 people there.  Clearly, people have busy lives, but there must surely be ways of improving that.  We have learnt a lot from the pandemic about what we can and cannot do, and perhaps lessons can be learned from that.<\/p> <p>  I have asked a number of questions.  If I can, I will try to fit in one of my colleagues after the witnesses' responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#M00700","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>In the Irish Cancer Society one of the things we hear about regularly is the financial impact of cancer.  Cancer is not something for which one sets aside savings or puts financial supports in place to manage its cost.<\/p><p>One of the things we have heard is that people are not prepared for that cost, so in all of our pre-budget submissions we have asked the Government to step in and try to reduce current levies, such as car parking, inpatient charges and outpatient charges.  A reduction in these levies would make the lives of cancer patients much easier, so we encourage all members of the committee to do what they can to drive down those costs.<\/p><p> On the issue of those who have received their cancer diagnosis alone, or who have received some bad news in the last number of months, our support line, which is staffed by oncology nurses, has dealt with many calls from those feeling the loneliness that has permeated the Covid period.  We spoke earlier about fear, and cancer patients in particular have been very fearful about accessing healthcare and getting Covid, and it is likely that this fear has translated into them not seeking healthcare when they should.  It is important that we do everything we can to enable people to share those moments with those they love.  If anything, the pandemic has highlighted the human side and what is important to all of us is our health, our families and our friends.  It is important to remember those things.  Psychological support has been invaluable throughout Covid, and the Irish Cancer Society has stepped up in that respect.  We are pleased to partner with the NCCP and Cancer Care West in providing additional psychological supports for people, but these supports need to be provided to everyone and need to be woven into the cancer system so that they are available as a standardised model of care, and this has been approved by the NCCP.  That is going to require putting people into roles to provide this support, because having cancer is a very traumatic experience, both physically and psychologically.<\/p><p> With regard to men's health, like every other sector of society, we need targeted approaches to encourage people to access healthcare to make sure they get diagnosed as early as possible.  The supports required need to be put in place, and the Irish Cancer Society would very much like to partner with others in that area to ensure we can work together and get people into care as quickly as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Morrogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I would have liked the HSE to respond, but we just do not have the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I want to ask about the mobile breast cancer screening units that are in operation around the country.  There are 21 of them, one of which operates from the car park of Clare County Council's headquarters in Ennis.  It has been hugely successful, and many women throughout County Clare and beyond have had mammograms done there.  As we start to - hopefully - emerge from Covid in the months ahead, I am wondering if there are plans to expand this service.  In particular, would the witnesses consider introducing a mobile screening service for testicular cancer and prostate cancer, and perhaps a mobile checking point for testing prostate specific antigen levels for the men in this country?  The mobile screening units have been hugely successful in more rural areas, where, unlike cities, people cannot go into physical clinics.  I would like these services to be expanded, and to receive assurances from the witnesses that these services will be retained and possibly increased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I am happy to confirm that we will be maintaining the mobile screening service.  In the case of BreastCheck, our intention is to increase the number of mobile screening units.  We have 21 at the moment, and we plan to increase that by one, but perhaps by up to three, depending on whether we can get a static centre or a mobile unit.  Reducing geographical access issues greatly encourages people to come forward for screening.  I am glad to hear that the Deputy thinks the service works well in Clare.  I think it works well around the country.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that the Deputy raised the issue of men's health services because there is a real message to send out to men around bowel cancer screening.  Currently our uptake for this service is approximately 50%, so half of the people who could come forward for quite a simple bowel check are not doing so.  It can be done in the comfort of one's own home, and it is a simple test to do and to send back.  The benefits of doing this test are enormous.  Over a ten-year period of screening, we anticipate that deaths from bowel cancer for those who come for screening will reduce by one third.  That is a huge number for a cancer that is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Ireland.  We will do anything we can to encourage people to come forward for bowel screening.  Over the course of the next five years our ambition will be to expand the number of people who can take up bowel screening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I apologise, but I must cut Ms Murphy off there, because we are way over our time limit, and there is a safety element to consider in respect of members of the committee and staff here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I would be happy to send a note of my response to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020120900002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their engagement today.

Mar at&aacute; cloiste againn le l&aacute; n&oacute; dh&oacute; anuas, t&aacute; os cionn 300 leas&uacute; ar an mBille molta.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; i gceist agamsa go speisialta cur leis na leasuithe sin ach ba mhaith liom labhairt faoin bpr&oacute;iseas dr&eacute;achtaithe f&eacute;in.<\/p> <p>  Ar an &aacute;bhar sin, cuirfidh m&eacute; smaoineamh n&oacute; coincheap n&oacute; dh&oacute; faoi bhr&aacute;id an choiste a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh cabhr&uacute; linn an feinim&eacute;an uaf&aacute;sach seo a thuiscint.  In ainneoin dea-thoil an Rialtais agus an Chomhaireachta, agus in ainneoin d&iacute;cheall agus d&uacute;thracht an choiste seo, n&iacute;l aon Bhille teanga s&aacute;s&uacute;il f&oacute;s againn, n&oacute; ceann leath-sh&aacute;s&uacute;il fi&uacute;, tar &eacute;is tr&eacute;imhse fhada m&aacute;inne&aacute;la agus moillead&oacute;ireachta.  Is ionann an feinim&eacute;an seo agus ceilt cearta agus ceal&uacute; an daonlathais.  Is beagnach gur f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; gurb ionann &eacute; agus t&iacute;or&aacute;ntacht dhalba a bheith &aacute; imirt ar chuid shuntasach de mhuintir na t&iacute;re, s&eacute; sin, pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th an f&aacute;l go haer seo?  An bhfuil D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann ag iarraidh r&oacute;pa a dh&eacute;anamh as gaineamh?  An bhfuil pobal na Gaeilge, an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, an coiste seo agus fi&uacute; an Rialtas f&eacute;in ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il caisle&aacute;n san aer n&oacute; ag iarraidh olann ar phoc&aacute;n gabhair?  Cib&eacute; rud at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute;, is scannal &eacute;. <\/p> <p>  An ch&eacute;ad choincheap gur mhaith liom a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an choiste n&aacute; b&eacute;ascna.  T&eacute;ann an focal \"b&eacute;ascna\" siar go dt&iacute; tr&eacute;imhse na sean-Gaeilge agus go dt&iacute; seandl&iacute;the na nGael, an f&eacute;ineachas.  Is \"culture\" an m&iacute;ni&uacute; a thugann an Focl&oacute;ir Gaeilge-B&eacute;arla air agus is cult&uacute;r sa chiall antraipeola&iacute;ochta at&aacute; i gceist.  In aon fhocal amh&aacute;in, baineann b&eacute;ascna leis an saol mar a chaithimid &eacute; &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute;.  Is &eacute;ard t&aacute; sa bh&eacute;ascna, dar leis an antraipeola&iacute; agus teangeola&iacute; Dr. Daniel Everett, gr&eacute;as&aacute;n teib&iacute; a mh&uacute;nla&iacute;onn agus a cheangla&iacute;onn le ch&eacute;ile r&oacute;il s&oacute;isialta, r&eacute;ims&iacute; eolais, agus luachanna rangaithe.  Beidh m&eacute; ag teacht ar ais ag luachanna rangaithe i gceann n&oacute;im&eacute;id.  F&aacute;gann an bh&eacute;ascna a lorg ar dhaoine aonair, ar a bpobal, ar a n-iompar agus ar an gcaoi a smaoin&iacute;onn siad.  Tig linn b&eacute;ascna chom&oacute;nta &Eacute;ireannach a chur i gc&aacute;s agus tig linn, ar an gcaoi ch&eacute;anna, b&eacute;ascna&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la in &Eacute;irinn a chur i gc&aacute;s chomh maith - fo-bh&eacute;ascna&iacute; a bhaineann le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; agus le pobail faoi leith.  N&iacute; hionann b&eacute;ascna na Gaeilge agus b&eacute;ascna an Bh&eacute;arla agus n&iacute; hionann an bh&eacute;ascna at&aacute; ag duine d&aacute;theangach agus b&eacute;ascna an duine nach bhfuil aige ach aon teanga amh&aacute;in.<\/p> <p>  An dara coincheap n&aacute; eolas neamhr&aacute;ite.  Luaigh an fealsamh agus eola&iacute; Ung&aacute;ireach, an Dr. Michael Polanyi, a th&aacute;inig chun c&oacute;na&iacute; i Sasana aimsir na Naitsithe, an t&eacute;arma \"tacit knowledge\".  D&uacute;irt an Dr. Polanyi - is r&aacute;iteas m&oacute;r aige &eacute; seo - go mb&iacute;onn n&iacute;os m&oacute; ar eolas againn n&aacute; mar is f&eacute;idir linn a r&aacute; i bhfocail.  An sampla clasaiceach a luann s&eacute; n&aacute; marca&iacute;ocht ar rothar.  I measc ruda&iacute; eile a bhaineann le heolas neamhr&aacute;ite t&aacute; scileanna, mar shampla uirlis cheoil a sheinm, adhmad a shn&iacute;omh, picti&uacute;r a ph&eacute;inte&aacute;il, sc&eacute;al a insint, n&oacute; an scil at&aacute; i gceist le Bille a dhr&eacute;acht&uacute;.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r a r&aacute; go dtagann scil anuas &oacute; ghl&uacute;in go gl&uacute;in.  Tagann scil dr&eacute;achtaithe Bill&iacute; anuas &oacute; ghl&uacute;in amh&aacute;in dr&eacute;acht&oacute;ir&iacute; go dt&iacute; an ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile in imeacht na mblianta.  T&aacute; go leor forbartha d&eacute;anta ar an gcoincheap d'eolas neamhr&aacute;ite &oacute; thosaigh an Dr. Polanyi ag caint air sna 1950aid&iacute;.  Anois aithn&iacute;tear go mb&iacute;onn eolas neamhr&aacute;ite ag pobail agus ag gr&uacute;pa&iacute; daoine.  Tugann lucht gn&oacute; eolas corpar&aacute;ideach n&oacute; \"corporate knowledge\" air i gc&aacute;s comhlachta.  I dt&eacute;arma&iacute; Peter Drucker, an saineola&iacute; ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; gn&oacute;, is \"culture\" &eacute;.<\/p> <p>  Sampla eile d&rsquo;eolas neamhr&aacute;ite gr&uacute;pa, agus bainimse an-taitneamh as an sampla seo, n&aacute; tr&aacute;cht.  T&oacute;g tr&aacute;cht na R&oacute;imhe, mar shampla.  T&aacute; sc&eacute;al pearsanta agam faoi sin.  Bh&iacute;os cinnte go leagfa&iacute; s&iacute;os m&eacute; ar thuras go dt&iacute; an R&oacute;imh blianta &oacute; shin agus m&eacute; ag iarraidh an tsr&aacute;id a thrasn&uacute; in aice leis an eaglais ch&aacute;ili&uacute;il San Pietro in Montorio.  Chonaic Meirice&aacute;nach m&eacute; agus th&oacute;g s&eacute; ar l&aacute;imh m&eacute;.  Shi&uacute;il s&eacute; amach i l&aacute;r na tr&aacute;chta agus mise taobh leis.  Lena threoir, d&rsquo;&eacute;irigh liom eaglais ch&aacute;ili&uacute;il na nGael a bhaint amach sl&aacute;n s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte.  Thug an fear uasal sin comhairle dom an l&aacute; sin agus ba mhaith liom an comhairle ch&eacute;anna a roinnt leis an gcoiste.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute;: \"You&rsquo;ve got to take command\".<\/p> <p>  Scr&iacute;obh Everett, an t-antraipeola&iacute; a luaigh m&eacute; ar ball, faoi \"ranked values\", na luachanna rangaithe ar dhl&uacute;thchuid den bh&eacute;ascna iad.  Sin an tr&iacute;&uacute; coincheap gur mhaith liom a roinnt leis an gcoiste.  Baineann s&eacute; seo le tosa&iacute;ochta&iacute;, n&oacute; na luachanna a chuirimid chun tosaigh ar luacha eile.  N&iacute; g&aacute; gurb ionann na luachanna a chuirtear chun tosaigh sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s agus na luachanna a chuireann an Rialtas chun tosaigh, gan tr&aacute;cht ar an D&aacute;il n&oacute; ar an Seanad, agus gan tr&aacute;cht ar chor ar bith ar phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Shamhl&oacute;inn go gcuirfeadh na R&uacute;naithe Ginear&aacute;lta &eacute;ifeacht agus &eacute;asca&iacute;ocht oibre a Ranna f&eacute;in chun tosaigh ar gach luach eile.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur mar sin is ceart, ach c&aacute; bhf&aacute;gann s&eacute; sin pobal na Gaeilge?  T&aacute; pobal na Gaeilge faoi l&eacute;igear, agus m&aacute; t&aacute; pobal baile faoi l&eacute;igear n&iacute;or cheart gurb iad an ch&eacute;ad dream a lorga&iacute;onn siad comhairle agus c&uacute;namh uathu n&aacute; an dream lasmuigh de na balla&iacute;, an dream at&aacute; ag ceilt bia agus sol&aacute;thairt&iacute; beatha orthu.<\/p><p>M&aacute; t&aacute; an teach tr&iacute; thine, n&iacute; h&eacute; an ch&eacute;ad rud a dh&eacute;antar n&aacute; iarraidh ar an gcomhairle contae tuairisc a chur amach faoin sol&aacute;thar &aacute;iti&uacute;il uisce.  An ch&eacute;ad rud a dh&eacute;antar n&aacute; glaoch ar an mbriog&aacute;id d&oacute;ite&aacute;in.  Is iad comhalta&iacute; an choiste seo briog&aacute;id d&oacute;ite&aacute;in na Gaeilge.<\/p><p> T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil an c&oacute;ras pr&oacute;ise&aacute;la Bill&iacute; fabhtach.  An mbaineann s&eacute; leis na tosa&iacute;ochta luacha agus ama at&aacute; i gceist ag an st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s agus ag na dr&eacute;acht&oacute;ir&iacute;?  M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;mid ar na cl&aacute;sail agus na hailt a bhfuil i gceist mar a thagann siad ar ais &oacute;n bpr&oacute;iseas, gan tr&aacute;cht ar an milseacht bhriathar agus s&iacute;nteoireacht aimsire at&aacute; i gceist, mar a d&uacute;irt &Oacute; N&eacute;ill le Mac Cochl&aacute;in aimsir Chogadh na Naoi mBliana, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil rud &eacute;igin am&uacute; agus go bhfuil an teach f&oacute;s tr&iacute; thine.  An bhfuil g&aacute; le hidirghabh&aacute;il de shaghas &eacute;igin n&oacute; le hidirghabh&aacute;la&iacute;?  D'fh&eacute;adfadh seo a bheith ina dhuine a dh&eacute;anfadh an Bille a thionlacan tr&iacute;d an bpr&oacute;iseas cont&uacute;irteach agus &eacute; a chosaint.  Theast&oacute;dh saineolas maith idirghn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta &oacute;n duine sin agus theast&oacute;dh &uacute;dar&aacute;s m&oacute;r uaidh n&oacute; uaithi.  Is f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; gur &uacute;dar&aacute;s &oacute;n Taoiseach f&eacute;in a theast&oacute;dh.<\/p><p> N&iacute;l a fhios agam.  Is mar scr&iacute;bhneoir agus mar &uacute;rsc&eacute;ala&iacute; is m&oacute; a bh&iacute;m ag obair agus ar an gcaoi sin b&iacute;m ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; na hintleachta agus na samhla&iacute;ochta agus le ceird na sc&eacute;ala&iacute;ochta.

T&aacute; an ghr&aacute;in dhearg agam ar an meafar bitheola&iacute;och.  Mar sin f&eacute;in, is uaf&aacute;sach an n&iacute; &eacute; le r&aacute; ach t&aacute; gach cuma ar an sc&eacute;al go bhfuil riarach&aacute;n na t&iacute;re seo, idir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus &aacute;iti&uacute;il, ag obair in &eacute;adan phobal na Gaeilge agus a dteanga agus ag cuidi&uacute; go m&oacute;r le deireadh a chur leis an nGaeilge mar theanga phobail.  &Aacute;fach, t&aacute; Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge ann.  Is fuirist at&aacute; s&eacute; an r&eacute;iteach a fh&aacute;il.  Is ar an gcoiste at&aacute; &aacute;r seasamh.

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to address the committee on the topic of Covid-19 pandemic supports to the islands and rural Ireland.  Members will be aware that responsibility for the islands' function transferred from the former Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the Department of Community and Rural Development in September.   The offshore islands and their communities are, of course, a fundamental part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  Many of the challenges that affect the islands are similar to those in other parts of rural Ireland, but they are even more pronounced due to the islands&rsquo; separation from the mainland.  We hope the islands will benefit from the closer alignment with the Department&rsquo;s suite of programmes and initiatives to support community development, rural economic development and digital innovation.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed our society and economy in the space of just nine months.  The impact of Covid-19 was extreme and immediate.  It has affected the way we work, study, socialise and go about our daily business.  Rural economies are vulnerable to economic downturns at the best of times due to their less diversified economic base and a greater reliance on small and micro-enterprises compared with large urban centres.<\/p> <p>  A report on the regional impact of Covid-19 published in May by the three regional assemblies concluded that coastal and rural counties are more likely to be exposed to the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 due to their high reliance on enterprises that require human interaction or which cannot be operated remotely.  We know, too, that sectors such as tourism, hospitality, arts and culture, on which many rural towns, villages and communities depend, have been among those most impacted by Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The social impact of Covid-19 has also been highlighted by many commentators.  The dispersed settlement pattern of rural Ireland, along with its older demographic profile than urban areas, also creates a particular social vulnerability for many people living in rural areas.  The Covid crisis has also demonstrated the extraordinary efforts of local communities, organisations and volunteers in mobilising to help those most in need or at risk of social isolation.  Many of the positive aspects of rural living have been highlighted, including the quality of life, a sense of community and close access to countryside trails, forests and coastlines.  These have been important factors in supporting the physical and mental well-being of many people at this time.  The Western Development Commission reported recently that 7% of respondents to a survey on remote working had relocated to the west of Ireland since the start of the pandemic, while a further 23% were considering doing so.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, many different supports have been introduced across Departments to help businesses, individuals and communities to cope with the impact of Covid-19.  In general, these supports are available to those who run businesses or live in rural areas.  I would like, however, to focus today on the supports the Department of Rural and Community Development has made available to support businesses, social enterprises, communities and voluntary organisations to respond to the impact of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The Department was centrally involved from the outset of the pandemic in the Government&rsquo;s Community Call initiative, which mobilised national government, local government and the community and voluntary sector to support vulnerable people in our communities.  In March, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 action plan, the Department provided support for volunteering, funding to ALONE for its crisis telephone support line and funding for an email help-desk facility to assist smaller community groups with their queries.  In April, an initial &euro;2.5 million Covid-19 emergency fund was introduced to provide immediate and urgently-needed funding to community and voluntary groups participating in the Community Call.  This helped with practical supports such as food for meals on wheels services, care packs for people cocooning, personal protective equipment or PPE, and delivery van costs.  Just last Monday, the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, announced a further &euro;1.7 million under this fund to enable community and voluntary groups to support the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s Keep Well campaign and to adapt their services to the Covid situation.  The Department also provided funding for the Covid-19 community outreach scheme, to help ensure that any gaps in service to the vulnerable in each local authority area were identified and met.  This particular outreach scheme was operated by The Wheel and Irish Rural Link.<\/p> <p>  Community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises have played a huge role in responding to the Covid-19 crisis at local level.  Many were impacted, however, by the loss of revenue from traded income or fundraising as a result of restrictions put in place to counter the spread of the virus.  To help address this, in May the Government launched a &euro;40 million support package for these organisations.  The package is administered by the Department and funded through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  It includes a &euro;35 million Covid-19 stability fund that provides financial support to organisations and groups delivering front-line services to those most in need, but which were in danger of closure.  To date, close to 600 organisations, including a number of island-based organisations, have been allocated almost &euro;31 million under this fund.  An additional &euro;10 million was allocated to this fund in October and will be distributed shortly.<\/p> <p>  The stability package also included a &euro;5 million Government commitment to a philanthropy fund, Innovate Together, which focuses on supporting community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises to make innovative adaptations to their operations to address the challenges presented by the pandemic.  To date, 52 organisations have been allocated funding to a value of approximately &euro;3.2 million under the Innovate Together fund.  Just yesterday, a further &euro;1.3 million was announced to 20 organisations.  Rethink Ireland is the organisation that administers the scheme on behalf of the Department.<\/p> <p>  Apart for those community supports, the Department has adapted its rural development programmes this year to help rural areas and rural businesses to adapt to the impact of Covid-19.  This year&rsquo;s town and village renewal scheme included an accelerated measure designed to support rural towns and villages to put in place measures quickly to enable people to shop and socialise safely within the public health guidelines.  A total of 363 projects have been approved by the Minister under the accelerated measure, to a value of &euro;10.4 million.<\/p> <p>  The standard town and village renewal scheme that we have operated for the past number of years is placing an emphasis on supporting towns to adapt to the impact of Covid-19 in the medium term.  A budget of &euro;15 million is available for this measure and it is expected that the successful applicants will be announced in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was also refocused this year to help communities and organisations in CL&Aacute;R areas to adapt to Covid-19.  This year&rsquo;s programme included supports for community recreational areas, such as picnic spaces and seating areas, where people can socialise outdoors in safe, accessible community spaces.  It also provided support for the adaptation of vehicles and the purchase of kitchen or delivery equipment for community organisations providing meals on wheels and other community services.  A total of &euro;4.5 million has been approved under the CL&Aacute;R programme to date for 160 projects, with some additional funding to be announced by the Minister in the coming weeks.  The grant rate for these programmes was increased from 80% to 90% this year, in recognition of the pressures on the finances of local authorities and community groups due to the disruption caused by Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Other programmes such as the rural regeneration and development fund and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme will also play an important role in helping rural areas to recover from Covid-19 in the medium term.  The rural regeneration and development fund has been repositioned this year to ensure that the investment provided can act as a driver for economic recovery in the post-Covid environment.  The Department has also shown flexibility in other schemes such as LEADER, the community services programme, Tidy Towns and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, recognising the difficulties faced by delivering organisations.<\/p> <p>  Specific accommodation has been provided to facilitate island communities during the pandemic.  Approximately 30 of the offshore islands are inhabited, with populations varying from fewer than ten people to more than 800 people.  A large proportion of those living on the islands are in an older age group, with the majority of the islands having a high dependency ratio.  Passenger transport and cargo services to the islands are lifeline services.  Our overarching objective has been to keep these services open throughout the pandemic but to do so in a way which ensures the health and safety of the islanders, service providers and visitors.  In March, following requests from island representatives and in recognition of the unique challenges of island living, travel to the islands was closed to outside visitors.  This decision was taken in consultation with the island communities and was welcomed by them.  While visitors were not permitted to travel to the islands, the islanders themselves could continue to travel to and from the mainland to avail of services.<\/p><p>The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht arranged to prepay subsidies to operators in March to support their operations and to continue the lifeline services to the islands during the lockdown.  The Department also worked with community representatives and ferry operators to facilitate temporary reduced sailing timetables in an attempt to reduce the risk of exposure for the island communities and ferry operators. <\/p><p> In keeping with the general easing of restrictions, travel by visitors to and from the islands was permitted from July.  Since then, as the committee will be aware, the Government's Living with Covid-19 plan has set out various restrictions in regard to travel at different levels of the plan's framework.  The Department will work with the service operators to ensure that appropriate services to the islands continue to be provided at every stage of the framework. <\/p><p> Along with my colleague Ms de Br&uacute;ch, I will be happy to take any questions the members may have on supports provided by the Department to help rural communities to cope with the impact of Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Parnell.

There are many issues.  There are some attitudinal matters I would like to touch on.  First, I noticed that all the documentation that comes from the Department refers to rural towns and villages.  Here Mr. Parnell throws in communities.  Once again, I must stress that 30% of the people who live outside the towns and villages do not see themselves as they are envisaged.  They go to the town or village to shop or whatever but they regard themselves as being part of communities in their own right, particularly those involved in organisations such as the GAA.  Once again, it is important to stress that the vast majority in rural Ireland do not live in towns and villages.  That might seem a small point but it keeps coming up.  I was made very much aware of this last night.  I was talking to a public representative in the Houses who lives in a very rural area of a county adjacent to Dublin.  He told me that in the new county plan, the wishes of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications have come true at last.  There will be no houses built in rural parishes, even those that do not have overcrowded schools, unless the applicant is functionally dependent on the land.  I could count on two hands the number of houses that will be involved, even in the large county involved.  That is why I have to keep raising this issue.  An attack is being made on the rural Ireland we know.  A new rural Ireland is being created, and I am not sure it is one I want.  We have to keep highlighting that.  I certainly will do so.<\/p> <p>  Covid has been negative for everybody but I hate the b&eacute;al bocht.  I reckon that, for young and old alike, rural areas were the lucky places.  When one gets lucky, one should not always say one is unlucky and whinge.  From talking to my neighbours and friends all around Connemara, and to people on the islands, I noted the first point made was that the people have space.  When the pandemic began, we saw footage from Italy in which everybody was on top of one another in high-rise flats.  The residents could not get away from their neighbours.  If they wanted to socially isolate, it was very difficult.  The first thing we realised here is that we have the greatest gift.  We are all on half-acre sites, which give us space to ourselves.  If we wanted to keep the kids away from other kids when they were kept from school in the spring, it was much easier to do so on a half-acre site than on a street or in an apartment in the city.<\/p> <p>  Suddenly people woke up in the morning and smelled the coffee and said their circumstances were not bad compared to those seen in other places on the television.  Many people remarked that it was a brilliant spring.  Saint Patrick's Day was fierce but after that the weather improved.  People were walking, and those near the coast could get to the strand in five minutes.  I see this as a time in which the quiet revolution has started that will have the huge impact on the whole of society.  As pointed out, people are now moving out of the urban areas voluntarily.  They are not being forced out; they have suddenly realised that there is no actual need to be tied to a fixed office in the city all the time.  They are moving out to places they want to live in.  Nobody is forcing them to go there.  Many people went home for a few weeks during the lockdown because they could put the laptop up on the table and they were able to look out the window at God's nature.  It was easier to isolate socially.  We should, therefore, look at the positive side and say this could be the turning of the corner for rural regeneration and rebirth.  It could lead to more balanced populations in rural areas.  We should always see the glass as half full.<\/p> <p>  I keep hearing about rural isolation.  Isolation is a major issue but in many cases it is worse in the cities because it is easier to become socially isolated in a city, particularly, funnily enough, in middle-class parts, whose populations tend to be more transient because people move to different areas from generation to generation.  In looking at the effect of Covid, we should remember that Willie Bermingham, who founded ALONE, did not start out the country.  We must acknowledge that while social isolation is a major issue everywhere, the social capital out the country is really good, certainly in my parish.  The minute Covid started, the local organisations, without any help from the State, made sure that every older person had his or her shopping done and delivered to the door.  Communities got together to minimise the number of people going to the shops.  Rather than having five families go to the shop, thereby creating a risk, a family could order what it wanted by telephone, have it delivered and pay the bill at the end of the week.  We need to be positive and stop doing the b&eacute;al bocht.<\/p> <p>  I recall having this debate years ago with a Deputy in the House.  I said that if rural Ireland was as bad as he was saying, he should shift all the people out of it.  I said I did not believe his argument.  I would not live in the city.  I chose to live in the country because I believe the quality of life is way better there.  There narrative we hear all the time makes it sound as if we were all on our uppers and lacking services.  We definitely need better things but, in the round, rural living has great advantages.  We need to get positive about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#C00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":779,"content":"<p>The Deputy's comments are very helpful.  The Department and Minister fully subscribe to the view that rural Ireland is positive and dynamic.  The Minister has spoken about the contribution rural economies and communities make to our national well-being and development.  Indeed, she has spoken about the need to change the narrative on rural Ireland and also about the interdependency of rural and urban areas.  I assure the Deputy, in respect of his points on rural Ireland, that it is not just about towns and villages.  We are very much aware of that.  The rural regeneration and development fund, of which the Deputy will be aware, amounts to &euro;1 billion, is not just for towns and villages; it is also for the areas outside them.  There is no doubting, however, that towns and villages do act as hubs for economic activity and social engagement.  That is why there is a focus on trying to support towns and their rejuvenation as places for people to shop, visit, socialise and live.<\/p> <p>  On isolation, the Deputy is quite correct that it is not just a rural issue.  It is a societal issue regardless of whether those affected are living in a rural area or an urban one.  Many of the supports I referred to in my opening statement are available to all communities, regardless of whether they are in rural areas or cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  My first question concerns the report from the Western Development Commission.  We are all well aware that people have moved west, sometimes back to where they grew up, since Covid hit and they have been able to work remotely, which has been great and positive.  If there is to be an increase in the population in rural areas, such as Roscommon, Galway, Sligo and Leitrim, will there be a sustained examination of their development?  For decades there has not been a move to rural areas like that which has happened since Covid hit.  Where populations increase, we should examine to a greater extent the infrastructure and the services that can be provided to follow those people.<\/p> <p>  The European Regional Development Fund is particularly important for the northern and western region.  The witnesses will be aware that as a region in transition, we will have really good co-financing from Europe, at 60:40, which is excellent.  What level of engagement does the Department have with the regional assemblies?  I refer in particular to the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.  From 2021 to 2027, we need to take full advantage of those co-financing rates to ensure that we will improve and move back from being a region in transition to being a developed region.  The fund will be crucial in doing that.  Whether for infrastructure, education or whatever else, we should take full advantage of everything we can use it for.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the briefing material they provided in respect of the islands.  The funding for the Irish Islands Federation is welcome.  It has highlighted housing as the number one issue for the islands, and particularly their levels of housing stock.  I visited Arranmore a few weeks ago when it was safe to travel there.  The number one issue on the island was that people were coming home but there was nowhere for them to live.  There were a number of vacant properties but there was not funding to renovate them.  I appreciate that this is a housing matter, but because it is a big issue on the islands, I would like to see the Department working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in regard to it.<\/p> <p>  The briefing document referred to water on the Aran Islands.  There is a wider issue with water.  Restrictions are almost continuous during the summer if there is a drought.  On Inisheer, there were issues in May, when the water was being turned off at 5 p.m. and the last boat every day arrived at 7 p.m.  People were constantly being told to wash their hands, yet they had no water.  Those issues relating to drought have been allowed to continue every summer.  Water restrictions need to be sorted out and fixed because they should not happen in the midst of a global pandemic.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of broadband for the islands, Arranmore has a really good remote working hub, which people are using all the time.  I know that the Department is doing work on providing remote working hubs for rural areas, but are they being considered for the islands in particular, as well as the broadband connection points?  Will that be considered beyond Arranmore?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#D00100","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":781,"content":"<p>The Deputy spoke about the population increase and what needs to happen throughout the regions to meet the targets in the national planning framework.  Initiatives such as remote working will help to attract people but also, importantly, to retain them in rural areas.  Young people will always want to travel and move to new pastures but, equally, many would like to be able to come back or to remain in rural areas.  As we roll out broadband connection points and remote working hubs, it presents an opportunity to change the complexion of rural Ireland and to help to support population retention or population increase.<\/p> <p>  The Department has been to the fore in leading the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC, initiative, which seeks to attract investment, create jobs and improve quality of life for the region from Kerry to Donegal.  The Western Development Commission is the co-ordinating agency for the AEC initiative.  The initiative is very important because it covers whole-region investment to try to attract foreign direct investment or indigenous enterprise to invest in the region, and it has met with some success.  The remote working hub network project is being driven by the AEC initiative.  We work closely with the Northern and Western Regional Assembly in respect of the AEC initiative and it has been very supportive and good at inputting to the initiative.  The Deputy asked about the opportunity that will come from the European Regional Development Fund.  We will work closely with the Northern and Western Regional Assembly and the Southern Regional Assembly in respect of the Atlantic economic corridor to cover those counties that are further south.  While that region in the north west was regarded as a region in transition, it nonetheless highlights the need for investment and the opportunity to get that higher rate of investment from the EU.<\/p> <p>  I might ask Ms de Br&uacute;ch to respond to the Deputy's queries on the islands before I say a little about the broadband connection points and remote working hubs on the islands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":782,"content":"<p>The Department is acutely aware of the water and housing issues on the islands.

Water, certainly, is one of the major issues that has arisen on the Aran Islands, as is housing, which is not an issue on every island but is on many, whether in respect of planning permission or social housing.  Each of the islands is very different and they all have their individual personalities, if we can call them that.<\/p> <p>  The Department is not directly responsible for the water or housing issues but, as part of the development of the policy, we are about to engage in a series of bilateral meetings with the line Departments responsible for these issues.

The accelerated measures under the town and village renewal scheme were very welcome, as was the CL&Aacute;R programme.

It was brought to my attention that there is a position in that centre for a caretaker.  The previous caretaker, who would have been employed under the community services programme, has retired.  Because the community services programme is currently being reviewed, there is a state of flux in that regard and the position has not been filled, and there is no indication that it will be filled.  I have corresponded with the Department on the matter.  Other public representatives and I have been contacted by the Michael Cusack Centre.  Perhaps it is unfair to throw it out to the officials here but maybe they could follow up on that.  This issue arose during Covid and it is unresolved.  The broadband connection at the centre today should be a good news story, and it is being opened formally by the chief executive of Clare County Council, Mr. Pat Dowling.

There are 13 BCPs that are either established on islands or are due to be established, which includes Valentia Island, which we know is connected via a bridge.  I can forward on a list of those islands.  Inisheer, Inishbofin, Inishmaan, Tory Island, Bere Island, Sherkin Island, and Inishturk and Clare Island in Mayo, also have BCPs, either <i>in situ<\/i>or due to be connected in the first quarter.<br\/><br\/>A lot of the BCPs are adapting now to provide remote working facilities.  We can certainly see that the BCPs have the potential to do a lot more than simply be hot-desk spaces.  My colleague Dr. Stjohn O'Connor was with the committee last week and he would have given a flavour of this.  The intention is to try to develop the facilities and services that can be available and be provided online at these centres including, for example, e-health initiatives and so on.<br\/><br\/>There is, of course, a much broader number of remote working hubs and digital hubs around the country.  The committee will also have heard from my colleague about this.  Some of these are privately owned, some are operated by social enterprises and some are public hubs.  Separate from the BCPs, there is a hub on Arranmore in County Donegal, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta plans to open a hub on Achill Island.  Again, while that is not an offshore island it gives the committee a sense of what is happening in that area.  It is important that we continue to develop these.  We are seeing the great interest in remote working, as the Deputy referred to, and there is an opportunity here to transform rural Ireland as the Minister, Deputy Humphreys has said.<br\/><br\/>I shall now return to Deputy Carey's question about the programmes and schemes for next year.  One of the things the Department prides itself on is that we can be flexible and adaptable, and we can change our programmes as the needs arise.  We are heading into 2021 keeping a very open mind on what is needed here.  Notwithstanding the vaccine, it is clear that it will take some time before we ever return that what is being called &quot;normal&quot; living.  We would also see the need for supports to help communities to help rural businesses to recover in a post-Covid-19 context.  There is a lot of work to be done to build up again the tourism and hospitality sector.  This is where programmes such as the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund can be very helpful in building again those assets that would help the medium-term and the longer-term recovery of rural areas, and I mean rural areas in the widest context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for coming to the committee today.  Water has been mentioned.  Is there any rainwater harvesting in the islands?  To me this would be a no-brainer because, as we know, the west gets tonnes of rain.  Cubic metres of water can be stored easily, which is 1,000 litres per cubic metre.  This can go a long way.  I have seen at first hand how it gets put into schools and halls.  I have not heard any mention yet of rainwater harvesting.  Such stored water could be there in emergency situations if water has run out.  Infrared technology can be used to kill off bacteria.  Is the Department looking into this as an option besides being dependent on a mains supply all the time?<\/p> <p>  There are a lot of great things happening but I have to say that I could spend all of my time trying to find all the things in order to let the community groups know about them.  I would love to know, for example, how the Department promotes these.  Is there a one-stop shop?  My time should not be spent doing PR and trying to connect the dots between supports and the community group and small businesses in rural areas.  I would love to know what is the best way to do that.  Is there a Department link or am I missing something?  Some community groups give out because they have not heard about a scheme that others did hear about.  I would like to have a fair and level playing field for all of them and I would like to know how we can do that better.  How does the Department advertise these?<\/p> <p>  I would also like to highlight the very important role that local markets play.  We have a very good local market in Rosslevan, near Ennis.  This has been a great social gathering for people where they can go to support local producers, growers and crafts people.  When they could not go to mass and when there were no shops open it was the only thing one could do to meet other humans.  We have very few of such markets.  I believe there are 126 of these markets out of 1,500 towns in Ireland.  From being involved in them in the past, I know that these markets can struggle to get proper supports from the local authorities or from the Government.  We really need to look at that.  For older people or for those who live alone, going to a market might not really be about buying the produce; it could be more about the social element.  There is an excellent market in Kinvara where they have live music but it has occurred to me that in my county we only have one regular farmers' market in the whole county.  There is something wrong with this and we need to look at them to give them more supports.  They need to be less complicated.  There was a market in Ennis but it got really complicated, whereby they wanted to charge the market &euro;20,000 if it wanted electricity.  The market has since found space in a private place that said they could have all the electricity in the world.  We are failing when it comes to local markets.  We have climate change and we have Brexit, we have social and mental health issues, and then there is rural isolation.  The Department needs to look more at supporting local markets, local growers and local gatherings, which are outdoors and safe.  I would like to hear the officials' views on this, and would like to work on this in the future with the Department.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke of the fact that it is hard to get planning permission in rural areas these days.  It is also hard to access all the empty houses in rural areas.  There are 48 in the village I am from, and I live in a two-pub, one-shop town.<\/p><p>Some of them are derelict while others are just empty, but there is something missing in that respect.  I know from travelling around north Clare and west Clare - we probably saw it everywhere - the amount of social housing as well as shops and town houses that are empty in most rural villages. Something drastic needs to be done about that, whether it is giving the owners a carrot, so to speak, to help them renovate and rent out the property, because there is a lack of places to rent in rural areas.  We need to look at the question of empty houses.  We do not always have to build new houses.  Let us look at the existing buildings and whether we can do more to encourage people to do them up or rent them out if they do not need them.<\/p><p> There are also many empty houses on the islands that family members may have built but they no longer live in them.  They may use them for Airbnb purposes but they are not available all year round.  We have issues with Airbnb around Lahinch and Ennistymon where houses are rented out for a few days when we have major issues with finding places to rent around north Clare.  I would like to see more done for the existing buildings that would bring life back into villages and towns.<\/p><p> It is important that we do not always overcentralise funding.  For example, there is a great group in Newmarket-on-Fergus which does meals on wheels.  They were hoping to expand that service.  They have been getting phone calls from all across the county to expand it.  I helped them with a pre-budget submission.  It went to a central rural development group nationwide but I worry that by the time that funding is drawn down, it might not happen as effectively as it would have with an existing group who know what needs to be done because they have been doing the work on the ground for years.  We need to watch out for that.<\/p><p> The community employment, CE, schemes were mentioned.  It is very important that we make them as inclusive as possible.  I continue to get phone calls from people who would love to join but they are not allowed either because they are too old or they have been means tested and, as their wife is a teacher or something like that, they cannot access it.  That is an important link, whether it is a CE scheme for three months, a year or whatever.  It would be welcome if we could look at that because it is a great social outlet for people in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#E00300","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  She raised quite a number of issues.  I will address some of them and then ask Ms de Br&uacute;ch to talk about the rainwater harvesting and any other issues relating to the islands.<br\/><br\/>The Senator asked how we promote our various schemes.  I appreciate that there are many schemes across Government.  Information on the schemes the Department operates is available on the Department's pages on the <i>gov.ie<\/i>website.  I appreciate that not everybody would necessarily have ready access to that information but most of these schemes are delivered through the local community development committees, LCDCs, of the local authorities.  The separate local development companies, which are often referred to as LEADER companies, are involved in the delivery of many of our schemes.  The local development companies are very active at community and local level so they should be in a position to provide information on any of the schemes operated by the Department or the Department of Social Protection.  That would include the likes of CE schemes.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the local markets, one of the lessons we have learned from the Covid-19 experience is the value of these outdoor markets, and not only in rural areas.  We have seen a local farmers' market close to my own home in Bushy Park.  There is no doubt that they bring a buzz and a bit of vitality to the area.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned in my opening address the accelerated measure under the town and village renewal scheme.  A number of projects have utilised funding to support the type of activity the Senator spoke about.  Donegal town has established an outdoor food market based on the funding from that accelerated measure.  In Ballyconnell, County Cavan, they have created an outdoor space for people to meet.  We have seen that in many different towns throughout the country.  Kildare town is a good example also of where they have converted the car parking space in the centre of town to make public seating and dining areas available.  That has enhanced those town centres.<br\/><br\/>The Senator mentioned empty buildings in towns.  That is an issue that has been raised on many occasions and it is one of the reasons we place a focus on supporting town revival and regeneration.  The Department ran a pilot scheme, which finished last year, to examine the whole issue of town centre living.  An independent report on that initiative was published in June of this year and it concluded that the issue of vacant properties is a complex one.  Sometimes, it is about people who have inherited a house and they do not know what to do with it or they do not have the resources to do anything with it.  In other cases it can be more costly to invest in the house than the return they will get on the investment.  More can be spent doing up a house than the eventual market value of a house in a town centre.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding that, the Senator will be aware that the programme for Government includes a commitment to a town centre first principle.  A colleague in the Department is co-chairing a group that has been established to look at progressing the town centre first principle.  As part of the work of that interdepartmental group, which includes a chief executive from Tipperary County Council, the group will examine the various recommendations made in the independent report on town centre living to see how they can be progressed.  It is an issue we are very conscious of as a Department and we will continue to work on it over the course of 2021.<br\/><br\/>I will hand over to Ms de Br&uacute;ch.

If we do not have services in communities, we will not have any tourism business in those communities either because they are the life and soul in bringing tourism to rural communities.  Tourism can provide services to communities, whether restaurants, bars or whatever else.<\/p> <p>  My second point concerns the Atlantic corridor.  If people have ideas they want to progress, where do they go and how do they go about it?  The idea could cross several Departments, but who pulls the whole thing together?

If the local enterprise office cannot help that individual, it will certainly point him or her in the right direction, whether to the Revenue Commissioners, Enterprise Ireland or some other organisation.<\/p> <p>  As for community groups that might be looking for support for particular projects, again, the LEADER programme is a locally led model of community development.  It covers a number of different themes, including enterprise and employment, environmental protection and social inclusion.  Again, the best avenue to go down to find out information about LEADER or any of the other community-based programmes is the local development company.

Mr. Parnell mentioned that the Atlantic corridor runs from Kerry to Donegal.  Is there a special grant people can get?

The Atlantic economic corridor is a broader concept.  It does not involve specific programmes.  The concept for it emerged from the chambers of commerce along the western region.  The idea was to develop a proposition of scale that would act as a counterbalance to the east coast.  It is really about connecting all the economic hubs along the western region, all the way from Kerry up to Donegal, in order that a cohesive and critical mass is created to attract investment.  For example, rather than Limerick trying to market itself as the place in which to invest and Galway separately trying to do the same, the idea was to create this critical mass of different centres that are all connected.  As for trade possibilities, the corridor has two universities and a number of institutes of technology.  The idea is to harness all the capital that is there, whether human capital or infrastructural assets, to attract people to live, work and invest along the corridor.  It is very much a high-level branding of the region, one might say, but it is supported by a number of practical projects, such as the creation of a network of connected remote working hubs.  The Western Development Commission has a role in helping the Department to co-ordinate all the different projects and initiatives taking place there.  One of the initiatives, for example, apart from the remote working hubs I have mentioned, was a submission to the European Commission on the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, corridor, putting forward the point of view of all the interested stakeholders along the western region.  It is very much a regional approach that is taken to co-ordination by the WDC rather than the WDC being a repository for individual projects.  As I said, the likes of the local development companies, the LEADER programme and the local enterprise offices would be the appropriate places to go to in order to find information on various schemes that might be available to support individual projects or ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":809,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Ms de Br&uacute;ch agus roimh Mr. Parnell.  I thank Mr. Parnell for his presentation.  I acknowledge the work the Department has done during this extraordinary pandemic.  I know that many of its staff have worked extremely hard.  There is also the significant amount of money that has come into the regions.  It is acknowledged by many communities, as is the assistance that has been given.<\/p> <p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I come from a rural area.  I live 2.5 miles out from the town of Strokestown, in Roscommon.  Many people in rural Ireland felt privileged when this pandemic arose that they were in a rural area, that we had the space and were not in crowded areas.  One evening my family was watching on TV something about an inner-city part of Dublin where there were a lot flats.  At the time there was virtually a total lockdown.  I heard a member of my family comment that the people in that area of Dublin did not have even a green area to play in and that we were there with acres of space and places to work.  This is a significant factor and points to the development of outdoor spaces, even though, obviously, at certain times of the year the weather is not conducive to being outdoors.  In my area a lot of walks and cycle routes are being put in place.  Open space will become so important because, as has been said, we will still be living with Covid for quite a while, despite the vaccines and even though yesterday was a very good day.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the role played by many people in the community.  I refer in particular to postmen and postwomen.  I have got the feeling in recent years that An Post has been driving its workers to make more use of their time and not to engage.  One of the greatest aspects of postmen and postwomen in this country is their engagement with people on the doorstep.  It is very significant.<\/p><p>In many ways, they are carers, particularly for people who are on their own.  They make sure they engage with the person before they leave their door.  We should never underestimate that.  In that way, Covid has had an advantage.  I welcome An Post having gone out of its way to encourage its staff to engage with, encourage, help and support people.  In my area, a local paper is delivered by postmen and postwomen.  It is not part of their run but they do it as a gesture of goodwill.  That type of engagement is very important.<\/p><p> Some of my points have already been addressed and I do not expect the witnesses to respond to them.  On the issues of water and broadband, I very much agree with Deputy Kerrane that there are issues on the islands that need to be dealt with speedily.  I know that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has been raising such issues for a long time.<\/p><p> I refer to one of the briefing documents provided.  On the issue of water, it states that responsibility for the provision of water services is not within the remit of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  On broadband, it states that responsibility for the roll-out of broadband is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  It further states that primary responsibility for the provision of health services on the islands lies with the HSE.  Is there a co-ordinated approach on these issues?  We are talking about a specific group of people in specific areas.  Is there a co-ordinated approach across Departments to address all of those problems that have been going on for years and need to be tackled and developed?  <\/p><p> On the issue of community groups, it is fair to say that a significant amount of money has been made available for grants to do specific things in a town, village or area, but one of the sections that has been suffering is that of development associations.  They are the people with an office in a town who keep the whole town going.  They are unofficial tourism offices.  They are usually staffed by T&uacute;s workers or whatever and that is fine.  However, they do not have money to pay electricity, phone or rent bills.  They cannot run their lotto competitions or many other fundraising activities.  It is just not possible for them to do so.  I think money for this group was announced in recent days by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  Is that money an assistance to help them to keep their offices going?  It is only a matter of a couple of thousand euro.  If they get over these few months and there is some type of return to some form of normality, as I hope there will be, they will be able to refocus on the way they used to raise funds.  In the meantime, to get them over this little hill, a small financial aid of a couple of thousand euro would keep the groups going until summer.  It would mean the offices could keep their services going.  We should remember that these are voluntary services.  The staff all work in a voluntary capacity.  I am seeking clarification on the matter.  If the witnesses cannot provide it now, they may come back to me on the matter.  Is the funding recently announced by the Minister specifically for people who are trying to keep those offices going and provide local services?  The groups will have to apply to their local authority to get the money.  I ask for clarification on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#G01200","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":811,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising those points.  I will first deal with the question on funding for various organisations and then address the issue of the islands.  The Senator is correct about the difficulties that have been faced, particularly by groups such as voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises.  They found it very difficult to avail of some of the supports the Government provided which were targeted at businesses operating on a commercial basis.  In May, the Department launched a new &euro;40 million support package precisely for the organisations referred to by the Deputy, that is, organisations that could not raise funds because of the Covid restrictions or social enterprises that could not trade because they simply had to close down or reduce the level of activity in which they were involved.  As part of that package, &euro;35 million was made available through a Covid-19 stability fund.  Some 600 organisations have received almost &euro;31 million under that fund.  Several island-based organisations were among those that received funding.  These are small amounts of funding that take account of the level or percentage of income the organisations have lost as a result of the Covid restrictions.  It is very much targeted at organisations providing front-line services in terms of childcare, elder care and so on in the community.  An additional &euro;10 million was allocated to the fund in October by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and that funding will be distributed shortly.<\/p> <p>  Separately, &euro;5 million was committed by the Government to a fund entitled Innovate Together.  The fund also attracts philanthropic support.  It too is funding community-based organisations, but is more aimed at helping them to adapt their organisations and services to be able to pivot and continue to operate in a post-Covid context.  It is probably worth stating that &euro;5 million was made available in the July stimulus package to help community centres to reopen safely.<\/p> <p>  Those are some of the initiatives that the Department has taken to try to support these organisations.  In addition, the community services programme helps to keep many of the organisations to which the Deputy referred staffed.  Although several organisations struggled with being able to keep their services running, the Department has continued to provide funding to those organisations.  I hope there is sufficient breadth of funding and initiatives available in this area.  If there are any particular organisations about which the Deputy would like to inquire, we can discuss that after the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I do not wish to hold up the meeting.

They have an office and co-ordinate everything in the town.  For example, they support the town teams and act as an unofficial tourism office.  They do printing for voluntary groups.  In the case of some of the groups, it is not that they have been turned down for funding but, rather, that they never got a response when they sought funding for what they do.  If the witnesses cannot clarify this issue now, they may come back to me on it.  The CEO of Roscommon County Council spoke to me about this issue recently and outlined how important those local community development groups are in towns and villages.  There is no issue with regard to the workers who operate the offices.  The problems relate to lighting, heating and rental bills.  I know it is a very difficult area.  They are completely stranded in the context of funding.  My fear and that of the CEO of Roscommon County Council is that we will lose these voluntary groups..  There may be a way around this issue.

One of the roles of the islands division within the Department is to try to co-ordinate across the various sectors and, to a certain degree, to advocate on behalf of island communities.  That is why it is so important for us to be able to meet with individual communities to hear what their individual needs are.  As set out in the briefing, we held meetings on many of the islands until we had to stop holding such meetings as a result of Covid.  However, we have continued them on an online basis.  The meetings give us a very good feel for what these issues are.  The decision to look at developing an islands policy was taken by Cabinet agreement.  That is the level of seriousness the Government applies on this issue.<\/p><p>This was decided at a Cabinet meeting, with all the Ministers agreeing that their individual Departments would look at whatever services are being delivered on the islands and would try to come together with a better policy.

What the Department of Rural and Community Development is doing, through the islands division, is trying to advocate for that and pull all of that together to give a bigger voice to these islands.  For all that they are rural communities they do have slightly different challenges from others.  That point was very well made and it is a point we are trying to address through the islands policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sorcha de Br&uacute;ch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I will bring Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v back in now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#J00200","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I have a few specific questions.  Deputy Kerrane raised issues relating to regional development funding and the regional assemblies.  I have asked who was given the money the last time and received pages and pages of replies but they were all private companies.  I have nothing against that because we need to stimulate business in the area but there was nothing for infrastructure or that kind of thing.  It was all private companies.  Is there a role for the regional assemblies in the distribution of that money for infrastructure?  I am not talking about an advisory role.  There is a lot of misunderstanding there.<\/p> <p>  The Community Call is operated by The Wheel and Irish Rural Link.  I am absolutely fascinated by why the Department would not operate it.  It seems obvious that that brings in two layers when it should be one.  How was that done?  There are many areas in rural Ireland where The Wheel is unknown, and certainly Irish Rural Link is not that well known either.  It might be a little bit better known but not that well known.  How did they operate, on behalf of the Department, to get down into all the communities that do not have connections with these bodies?<\/p> <p>  The fund for community and voluntary, charity and social enterprises was a great idea because all these facilities and organisations had overheads and did not have their normal income.  The witnesses said 600 of them were funded but how many applications were received?  What percentage of these organisations were left with nothing?  It is fine to have bidding competitions but something as basic as meeting overheads does not solve the problem for the large number of organisations that bid for this, spent time making applications and got nothing.  I have always taken the view that it is better to divide less on more than more on less.  I would be interested to know how many applications the Department got for that fund.  We can then figure out how many cases applied and did not get funded.<\/p> <p>  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam maidir leis na hoile&aacute;in.

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an ceangal sin ann leis an m&oacute;rth&iacute;r agus molaim an Roinn as &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.

The two organisations in question were identified because of their outreach to local communities and they were involved in the community outreach initiative for a period of three months.  The Deputy will probably be aware that each local authority set up a forum to provide a co-ordinated approach to the community response and community champions were appointed in each local authority area to help deal with the position.

My issue with that, which is something I hope will be rectified in the new action plan, is that targets were met in job creation - 220,000 jobs - which was welcome but when one asks where those jobs are, one is told they are outside of Dublin.  That does not exactly narrow it down.  In this new action plan, I would very much like to see targets but I would like to see follow up also and that when we get to the end of the plan, information is provided as to where those jobs were created.  It is not enough to state \"outside of Dublin\".<\/p> <p>  While I greatly welcome the move to remote working, which is really positive, we do not want to see an over-reliance on that.  We need to see further job creation, which is so important.

It would be great if it could go on to a website and state that it is a sports club and what it is looking for and that options would then come up on what it can apply for.  Much of the time clubs and organisations do not know what they can apply for and what the criteria are.

Deputy Kerrane referred to the new rural policy.  The development of the policy was delayed because of the Covid-19 crisis but we will have a stronger policy as a result of it because one of the key things the country, as a whole, is going to have to deal with is how to respond and recover both economically and socially from the impacts of Covid-19.  The publication is obviously a matter for the Minister and he has indicated that the new rural policy might be published early in the new year.<\/p> <p>  I certainly appreciate Deputy Kerrane&rsquo;s question on jobs.  The difficulty we have in measuring exactly where the jobs are is that the CSO, in its labour force survey, counts the jobs at the level of the subregion on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS 3 regions basis.  One will get details on employment in the north west or the south of the south east, for example.  The CSO does not capture that information at county level.  The only time people get clear and precise information about employment at county level is through the census.  That is a little bit of a challenge but we can certainly measure it at the NUTS 3 level.  In the case of, for example, the west of Ireland, this will include Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  We will be focusing very much on job creation as a key element of the new rural policy.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the idea of one-stop shop for different schemes.<\/p><p>There is information on all of our schemes on <i>gov.ie <\/i>but<i><\/i>I appreciate that as schemes grow in terms of the different target groups we are trying to reach, it can be difficult for people to navigate their way around.  I take on board the Deputy's suggestion.  There is, perhaps, more we can do to help improve our signposting and also streamline our application processes. <br\/><br\/>Senator Burke asked about Pat Spillane's report, which is the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report published in 2014.  It was built on by the Action Plan for Rural Development, to which Deputy Kerrane referred, which ran from 2017 to 2019.  There will be a new rural development policy.  The CEDRA report delivered on a number of its initiatives and proposals.  The central proposal of CEDRA was the need to establish a Department with a senior Minister responsible for rural development.  That has happened, as the committee will know.  All of the recommendations of the CEDRA report which had not been delivered at the end of 2016 were factored into the Action Plan for Rural Development.  We carried out a review of the CEDRA report last year, which we published on the Department's website.  The review sets out the status of all of the different recommendations made in the CEDRA report.  I am happy to forward that review to the Senator if he would find that helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020120900002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Parnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Parnell.

I have an attitude in life that unless something is radically broken, do not mend it.  I cannot understand how we wound up having local companies, local company development committees, LCDCs, Pobal, the Department and Europe.  Those are five layers.  It is over the top and removes the immediacy of a programme.  That is a comment and I am not looking for a response.  I feel that strongly.  It has certainly worked well in Connemara where they just said that they would do it.  It has not been a problem.  There is an idea that we are involving public representatives.  Local authority members are on every LAG in the country.  The local authority had a big and a direct input.  They are now kind of on two LAGs.

Screen Ireland is responsible for promoting the expression of national Irish culture on screen, developing skills across the sector and attracting international productions to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The creative screen industries are transforming at an unprecedented rate globally, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Irish industry has experienced significant growth over the past decade but the pandemic has now impacted every part of the industry.  Live-action production in Ireland and around the globe effectively ceased in March 2020.  Producers, directors, writers, cast and crew were all affected and the Government&rsquo;s social welfare and business supports have proved essential.<\/p> <p>  With production at a standstill, focus was redirected to project development, which could continue remotely.  Distributors had to contend with films scheduled for cinema release transitioning to other at-home viewing platforms. Cinemas had to close and when allowed to reopen had to operate with severe restrictions, reduced capacity and limited international films to screen.  The animation industry demonstrated outstanding resilience, adapting quickly to remote working and keeping production activity going despite many challenges.<\/p> <p>  In immediate response to the crisis, Screen Ireland rapidly implemented a broad range of Covid-19 measures.  We have circulated a briefing paper to members outlining those measures.  Screen Skills Ireland also transitioned all of its courses online free-of-charge, including Covid-19 return to work and compliance officer training.<\/p> <p>  Throughout the pandemic, Screen Ireland&rsquo;s key priority has been to get the industry back to work, with health and safety of cast and crew the primary concern.  In preparation for recommencing production, Screen Ireland supported SPI in the development of comprehensive health and safety guidelines.<\/p> <p>  Production insurance has also been a significant challenge.  With exclusions in effect, the live action sector would not have been in a position to return to production without cover related to losses relating to Covid-19.  Screen Ireland was awarded &euro;5 million by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, to administer a production continuation fund for the sector.  This fund was run as a pilot in 2020 and we believe it will still be required into 2021.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to inform the committee that the industry has worked collaboratively since the start of the crisis, prioritising health and safety, and has demonstrated its resilience and creativity.  By the end of 2020, a total of 12 feature films, three TV productions, eight animated TV shows and 13 documentaries supported by Screen Ireland will have been produced.  We are expecting a significant amount of production activity in 2021, including large-scale TV productions in counties Limerick, Cork, Donegal and Dublin.  There are also a number of proposed developments in studio infrastructure that have the potential to transform Ireland&rsquo;s international offering in the coming years.  I thank for the committee for its time today and we look forward to answering any questions you might have.

On behalf of SPI, we want to thank the committee for the invitation to discuss with it the impact of Covid-19 on Ireland's dynamic film and television industry.<\/p> <p>  SPI is the national organisation for independent film, television and animation production companies, representing the entrepreneurs, employers and creative driving force behind Ireland&rsquo;s content on screen.  We represent everybody from first time producers to first-time producers and large-scale productions to smaller one-off productions.  Our member companies include some of the most successful and popular factual and entertainment makers on our screens.  I refer to shows like \"Ear to the Ground\", produced by Indie Pics; \"The Hunger\", produced by Tyrone Productions; \"After School Hub\" by Macalla Teo; and \"Pablo\" by Paper Owl Films.  These productions have captured the public imagination across all ages.  Our film and drama producers have gained well deserved international recognition and awards around the world for productions like \"Normal People\", produced by Element Pictures, \"Black 47\", produced by Wild Atlantic Pictures and \"The Other Lamb\" by my colleague's company, Subotica Films.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, we would like to recognise the support for our sector that has been provided through increased funding to my colleague in Screen Ireland via the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's sound and vision fund, TG4 and, of course, the range of other supports that have helped sustain our production companies through this difficult time.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, as with all sectors, the independent production sector found itself in an extremely difficult position due to Covid-19 when the first lockdown was announced.  A snapshot survey conducted by SPI in April found that 24 productions had to stand down, 59 productions delayed their start dates and 800 workers were laid off.  This resulted in &euro;20 million in unpaid wages, while insurance companies put up roadblocks in the context of access to funding.<\/p><p> SPI worked closely with industry stakeholders, including Screen Ireland and Screen Skills Ireland, to develop return-to-production guidelines for all genres of content in order to allow productions to continue under level 5 restrictions.  These guidelines operated no matter the size of the cast, crew or budget.  From ten-person short films to 700-person TV dramas, the same guidelines were followed regardless of the cost.  Cast and crew safety was paramount.<\/p><p> I want to outline my experience as a producer while adhering to Covid-19 protocols.  Coco Content has been in business since 1986 and hopes to continue to be for some years yet.  We produce award-winning programmes like \"Room to Improve\", \"First Dates Ireland\", \"Home Rescue\", \"St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival\" and \"Open for Business\".  It covers a range of productions for both our public service broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, as well as Virgin Media.  We also produce international documentaries.  Our latest was \"1916: The Irish Rebellion\", which has screened in over 60 countries.<\/p><p> Production during Covid takes more time and money.  This reduces profit and means that there are less funds available to invest in new ideas.  It is a catch-22 situation.  The purpose of our recommendations is to bring more productions back, employ more cast and crew in order that we can create more original Irish and international content for audiences to enjoy and help to reboot the economy.  While all in society hope that the public health measures required will be short- to medium-term in nature, we are asking the committee to look beyond this to ensure the long-term sustainability of the independent production sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Switzer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

Are the independent production countries finding it difficult to break into those commissions?  Does it run the risk of the commissions being safe and predictable with experienced talent being favoured?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#B00500","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":870,"content":"<p>The model of commissioning has served us well but there is not enough children's programming being commissioned by RT&Eacute;.

The demand for content has been clear throughout the pandemic, however.  The growth in direct-to-consumer services that we have seen across the world also speaks to the appetite of consumers.  Animation is a great area to speak about because the animation sector has a world-class reputation.  It is multi-award-winning and it is watched by millions of children around the world.  The industry has adapted incredibly well to the pandemic and has continued.  Whether it is \"Wolfwalkers\", which is No. 1 in the box office in cinemas, or \"Two by Two\", which was No. 1 in the UK and Ireland, there has been growth in animation.  One of the measures we put in place last week was a new fund, which comprised additional funding from the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  It was &euro;1 million to help support the industry in two ways.  One of those approaches is an innovation fund, which looks at how we can help scale and innovate in animation to build on the growth it has achieved.  The animation industry has approximately 2,000 direct employees in 35 studios.  We wanted to help the industry in that respect and with the skills deficit the Senator mentioned.  We will launch an animation academy to specifically address some of those issues.  The growth is so fast that we must ensure we have enough people to meet that skills need.

To continue on the point on animation, I agree that it has been fantastic to see the growth of that sector over the past ten to 15 years.  Prior to taking up my role with Screen Skills Ireland, I worked with Ballyfermot College of Further Education, which is renowned for its animation programmes.  Over my years there, it was fantastic to see a situation arise where graduates were able to leave the college and have jobs ready there for them to move into.  We have strong further and higher education provision for animation and that has helped the sector.  The work that Screen Skills Ireland does in our continuous professional development courses that support the sector is important and that needs to continue.  The sector is also well-served by having a dedicated animation skill net to support the sector.<\/p> <p>  If we take the issue a bit more widely and talk about skills deficits and needs, a collective effort is needed to be out in front of the opportunities that are there.  From a Screen Skills Ireland point of view, the opportunity is large and from a skills point of view, we need to try to be out in front of that opportunity as much as possible.  Reference was made earlier on to studio infrastructure and so on.  If some of that studio infrastructure comes to pass, we will need to be in a position in which we have skilled crew ready and available to take on work that comes in on the back of that infrastructure.  It is a collective response.<\/p> <p>  We have a good working relationship with the Department of Education and we link with it and with providers within the higher and further education space.  One of Screen Skills Ireland's key strengths is that we are connected in with the industry through our skills needs analysis process that we undertake annually through our regular engagement with industry and through our role on section 481 with the skills requirement there.  We have front-line access to data around the skills needs that are there currently and the skills needs that are coming down the track.  That data will be useful in influencing Screen Skills Ireland's provision and we also disseminate that information to higher education institutions so that they can respond to those needs as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Lee"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time but there were three other quick questions, which were on the audiovisual media services directive and the content levy, what we will do with section 481, and studio infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#C00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":880,"content":"<p>On the audiovisual media services directive, that presents a significant opportunity for Irish content and content-makers.

More and more we see the need to try to be involved at the earlier level Deputy Cannon mentioned.  The way we have tried to do this so far is to work with other stakeholders and empower and fund them to do some of the work on our behalf.  We work quite closely with the Irish Film Institute on its careers and screen programme to promote careers in the screen industry to transition year students.  We have also worked quite closely with young Irish film-makers on a summer programme relating to film-making and animation in order to get young people interested in both forms.<\/p> <p>  One of the first roles I was involved in when I joined Screen Skills Ireland just over two years ago was the development of a careers and screen website.  This is a website into which we have put a lot of time and effort.  It maps out all of the career roles available in animation and live action.  There are well over 200 roles listed on the site.  It is interesting that a lot of the time when we speak to people they do not realise there are that many roles available within the industry.

I have a few specific questions so I will go through them and whoever feels they are the appropriate person to answer, please feel free.  I was thinking mid-lockdown about the fact there was, I assume, no production going on.   It was mentioned that there were a number of months when there was nothing happening.  Are we likely to see that reflected in a couple of years when we will see a gap in our chosen platform, whether a TV or streaming service?  Are we likely to see the same stuff for months and notice there is nothing new happening?  Will there be a real impact in a couple of years when we will ask if they will ever bring out something new?  Ms Finnegan mentioned the 2020 figures: 12 films, three TV productions, eight animated TV shows and 13 documentaries.  How does that compare to 2019?  Do the witnesses have those figures?  Perhaps we will not see those figures impacted for a couple of years.<\/p> <p>  I assume international productions have also been impacted by the restrictions on travel.  We have a great reputation here.  \"Braveheart\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" were partially produced in the State, to name two films.  Are we still able to attract such international productions as we have in the past?  Can we work towards getting more in?  <\/p> <p>  With a view to being helpful, I will ask a direct question.  The witnesses touched on a few measures.  What steps could the Government take to create more opportunities for Irish productions?<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of some international film festivals where Irish movies are featured.  I presume Screen Ireland has a role in supporting Irish film festivals.  In west Cork, we have the Fastnet Film Festival, which is terrific.  It attracts a host of well-known Irish and international names.  I think Saoirse Ronan is one of the advocates for it and she goes down there yearly.  How will we face the challenges of supporting our own film festivals going forward?  <\/p> <p>  RT&Eacute; representatives were in here recently and that organisation has a variety of challenges relating to income.  I had a question on the audiovisual media services directive but the witnesses have explained that.  Is there an opportunity for RT&Eacute; to drastically increase its income from Irish productions being sold abroad?  What can be done to develop that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#E00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>In terms of the volume of productions seen in 2020, the number is not too far off what it was in 2019 but it is interesting to note that the value of those productions is down.  We estimate they are down approximately &euro;25 million.  That is because we have been able to get the lower budget productions up and running.  That is partly because those the funds covering some of the health and safety protocol implementation costs and the production continuation fund.  For example, a couple of feature films came through one of our schemes.  It is called the point of view scheme and is aimed at female directors.  It is really the lower budget films that were able to get back in.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a gap, there is a lot being made so hopefully the Deputy will not see a gap in his viewing experience. <\/p> <p>  On the international production side, in our trade mission in 2019 the interest in Ireland as a location for international productions was significant.  It is not only our tax incentive, though that is incredibly important - there are now almost 100 such fiscal incentives operating around the globe - it is also our workforce.  There is very talented and skilled crew in the country.  It is also our geographical location and English as a language.  Many different elements go into that decision-making.  In particular since the pandemic began, health and safety has become one of the top priorities in decision-making.  We are still a competitive location for production and we have seen a great deal of interest in coming back to Ireland and bringing international productions here.<\/p> <p>  Screen Ireland has supported all the Irish film festivals, helping them transition online, which has been challenging for all the festivals, including the Galway Film Fleadh and the Cork Film Festival.  They have done incredible work.  It is very hard because marketing has to completely had to reimagine how they promote the films.

One that may be close to the Deputy's heart is that of a Wexfordwoman, Br&iacute;ona Nic Dhiarmada, who was the brain behind \"1916: The Irish Rebellion\", which we made over two years.  Ten percent of the budget came from Ireland and 90% came from abroad.  It was screened in over 60 countries.  A small amount of seed capital from this country can grow from little acorns.  That is really important to the television side of the business.  The film and drama side works in a different way.  It is multi-funded, etc., but it is really interesting.

The film was screened in October and it was fantastic for the region and the area.  That followed \"The Quiet Man\", which was filmed in Cong, and John Wayne visited the village.  The impact that these productions have on the area in respect of promoting them as a tourist destination, is very welcome.  My question is this: how can we get local authorities to be more active on the ground to promote the areas as locations to both film producers and screenwriters?  I know that Martina Niland is a native of Aughagower and her own production company, Port Pictures, was instrumental in Mayo being used as a location for \"Wild Mountain Thyme\".

In the past, it was cheaper to shoot in Dublin and Wicklow, because most of the crews are based there, and travel and accommodation costs do not have to be considered.  The regional tax credit helps to offset those costs, and enables productions to be set in the west, where sometimes they really want to be.

There are a lot of very interesting initiatives that seek to address future skills that can be provided in higher education.  Another welcome addition on the education landscape is the Springboard+ course that allows providers to introduce very industry-facing programmes that address a very specific need at a point in time.  We have developed a number of certified programmes through Springboard+ with third level providers in the last few years that have added value to the provision for the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Lee"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":933,"content":"<p>I noted that Mr. Switzer said in his presentation that \"production insurance has also been a significant challenge\".

Insurers have linked arms quite tightly and said that these covers do not work for Covid and under civil authority.

Insurance is so important for the production sector in 2021.  We have a strong pipeline of projects coming here for 2021 but what has become clear is the extent of the unforeseen additional costs generated by the protocols in order to keep the industry working.  For some projects, it has cost a staggering amount to test the cast and crew every week.  People also need to work within pods so if there is a Covid outbreak then the affected pod can be removed thus avoiding transmission to the remaining cast and crew.  There is also the cost of quarantine.  I take my hat off to the industry that includes the producers, casts and crews who really wanted to work.  The circumstances in which they have had to work have not been easy but they are getting better and people have grown more used to them.<\/p> <p>  The insurance issues have been very difficult.  In February it hit us that the full suite of insurances were not available to production, which put it at huge risk in terms of any form of a Covid outbreak.  The Department put in place a production continuation fund but we still require that all productions are insured to the hilt as far as possible.  There had been a suite of insurances available to insure the cast, which was one of the big risks.  Unfortunately, that has fallen away because there have been calls on the fund in Europe.  We hope that the funding will come back to us in 2021.  The production continuation fund has been an enormous confidence boost to encourage productions to get back up and running.  It is our wish that the Government continues the scheme in 2021.  We would like to expand it because it was limited in nature as we were never sure that we could continue shooting productions in level 5.  We have continued, which frees up the funding a little.  We would like the scheme to be expanded and for opportunities to be explored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa McGrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":937,"content":"<p>On the insurance question, we were fortunate with the TV drama that I mentioned that we had been insured before the outbreak hit and we were covered for Covid-19 both in terms of insurance and the bond.  Bonding is just as important as insurance when it comes to the bigger budget projects because they are tasked to deliver the project no matter what happens.  The bond company is paid a fee and it delivers the project.  If anything happens where the production company cannot deliver the project, the bond company have to pay for that.  Now both bond the companies and insurance companies are excluding Covid-19 and it is very challenging.  I had another project that was supposed to shoot this year that has been pushed to next year because it cannot be bonded or insured for Covid-19.  As Ms McGrane said, this is a very significant factor for the industry.  We still do not know and we have a claim in on the current production.  We have no idea the extent to which the insurance company will honour that claim and I obviously cannot talk about specifics.  Most producers in the industry who have claims with the insurance companies are in the same boat.  We just do not know to what extent we will be covered and will probably find ourselves short at the end of the day, which is a bit of a worry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":938,"content":"<p>On the skills side, I would like to reference the work of Screen Skills Ireland and to commend the team on their work this year.  In March, Covid-19 hit us but, historically, we would have delivered all of our course provision face-to-face in physical environments.  We had to move to the delivery of online provision, which we did very quickly.  By the end of March we were up and running with online courses and were able to offer more than 80 different continuous professional development courses online to the industry throughout the pandemic.  That has been a great support to the sector in keeping people upskilled but it also provided an opportunity for people to meet and to bring a sense of community to the sector during a difficult time.<\/p> <p>  There are challenges, which is what the committee is focused on, and many of us wish to talk about and address these as we go forward, not least of which is Covid-19.  There are also, however, some very positive developments within the sector.  From a section 481 skills side, we have introduced a new system for tracking and engaging on the skills side requirements of that section.  That is leading to very positive skills development opportunities on productions and to us getting very close and detailed data on where the skills needs are in the industry, both current and future ones that are coming down the track.  <\/p> <p>  Another positive point worth referring to is the development of the guilds and how important the work that they do is becoming.  We have linked quite closely with the guilds in recent times on the development of a new competency framework for the sector, which will help in future planning around skills as well as the section 481 skills development process and will also lead to opportunities for curriculum development and all so on at third level, which will be important.  <\/p> <p> There are two other points that they may not have been discussed earlier but they are significant.  The first is the Government&rsquo;s announcement of a potential games tax credit down the line.  That is an interesting development.  There are many crossovers in skill sets across games, animation and visual effects.  That could help grow the sector and bring a lot of cross-pollination of skills.  Second, is where Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to the extension of the regional uplift of the 5% into next year, which is very welcome, given the difficult year that was 2020.  From my point of view that is about growing a regional skills base and that takes time.  The longer that the regional uplift can be extended to build a crew base, the better.  It will mean greater links between producers, companies and studios to local third level and further education providers, which will bring real strength and sustainability to growing the sector in a regional way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Lee"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":939,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lee.

Now that I have the floor, however, I might just use it double up on what Mr. Lee has just said on the skills development role that we have now with section 481.  That has been very innovative as we are the first country to link the development of skills with the tax credit.  A great team in Screen Skills Ireland is working very proactively with productions, not just with trainees but in upskilling the whole way up through production.  Many people are looking to us now and saying that that is a very innovative process and a great way of getting on-the-job training formalised.<\/p> <p>  There have also been many conversations on regional development and, as Ms Finnegan said, we are committed 100% to regional development.  Most of the production that will happen next year will probably go outside of Dublin.  Producers very much enjoy shooting outside of the Dublin area and love getting out to new locations.  We are very committed to opening up the regions as much as we can.

They pointed out, as people who had been working over that ten-year period or longer, that they had absolutely no rights whatsoever as employees and were in a completely precarious position, despite the fact that they worked for production companies that received moneys through section 481 and loans over a ten or 15-year period.  Many of those people, since they came in here, have not worked again in the film industry and say that they have been blacklisted out of it.  They have taken cases recently to the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in respect of, among other things, breaches of collective agreements with Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, members.  In one case at least, the Labour Court has found in their favour against a SPI member, which is one of the biggest recipients of funds under section 481.  <\/p> <p>  The other key point is that section 481 specifically requires that the recipient, which is the producer company - I have the declaration here that is required and the Designated Activity Company, DAC is mentioned - and the DAC have to comply with all employment law as a condition of section 481 eligibility and have to \"be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall be solely responsible in law for the employment, remuneration, taxes, immigration and work permits of all personnel retained for the purposes of the production of [insert film name]\".  That is very clear.<\/p><p>I want to understand why the chief executive officer of Screen Producers Ireland then went to the Labour Court this year and said there was no possible relationship between workers who had worked on section 481 film productions and the producer company.  I can quote them for the witnesses if they wish.  In other words, these are film productions that are getting money specifically on a legal requirement that they are responsible for the employment of people.  Those same recipients - and I will not mention names but two of the biggest production companies in two cases that have happened this year - went to the Labour Court or the Workplace Relations Commission and said they had no employment relationship whatsoever with these individuals, even though in their statements they acknowledge those individuals have worked on successive productions for which they got section 481 relief.

I was on the negotiating committee and I know how difficult it was.  Some 83% of SIPTU workers voted in favour of it and were very happy with it.  The guilds were strongly represented at the negotiation table.  It includes a transferable pension, which is ground-breaking in the industry.  From my experience and that of most of the producers I know, employer and employee relations are extremely important.  It is a small industry.  We all work together all the time.  We work together on a continuing basis but it is a project by project business.  That is the way it works.  One cannot have continuous employment when one is going from film to film or TV drama to TV drama.  Usually the directors of the designated activity companies, DACs, are the same as the directors of the producer company.  The reason we have to set up the DACs is because that is required under section 481 legislation.  We are compliant with Revenue and with the Departments on that.  We have no choice in the matter.  Also, other good news is that the WRC did an audit of the industry, which was published in August of this year, and it had very positive findings.  It recommended an agreement be reached between employers and employees, which was reached this week.  It said we should concentrate on skills development, which we very much are through Screen Skills Ireland, and that we should continue the strong relationship with the guilds, which we are doing.

Ensuring that it continues and remains competitive is incredibly important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":970,"content":"<p>I thank all witnesses for being with us both physically and virtually-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#L00500","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":971,"content":"<p>Can we ask additional questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020120900002#L00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":972,"content":"<p>We have a rota in place and if other members of the committee thought we were going to have a second round they probably would have remained.

I thank the Cathaoirleach and on behalf of the Commission for Communications Regulation, we are happy to appear before the committee to discuss consumer complaints about telecommunications companies, protecting customers and potential avenues for redress.  I am joined today by my fellow commissioners and Ms Barbara Delaney, who is our director in this area.<\/p> <p>  ComReg is the national regulatory authority, NRA, for electronic and postal communications.  We promote competition and investment in the sector.  We uphold end user rights and we manage the radio spectrum and of our strategic intents, it is key to ensure that consumers can choose and use communication services with confidence.  This is an important aspect of ComReg&rsquo;s activities. It has had a greater profile in recent months because of the significant problems that Eir customers have had getting in touch with the company.  While any call centre can experience occasional problems with waiting times, Eir customers faced unacceptable waiting times over an extended period during the last couple of months.  <\/p> <p>  It might be helpful if I start by providing the committee with a brief overview of ComReg's role in upholding the rights of consumers.<\/p><p>Our functions in upholding end-user rights derive mainly from EU legislation.  Our role includes both sector-specific rights and rights derived from general consumer protection legislation.  We provide information to consumers and a redress facility when they cannot resolve complaints with their service providers.  We take action against service providers that fail to meet their obligations or uphold the rights of consumers.<br\/><br\/>One of the important matters we oversee is ensuring that it is easy for consumers to switch to alternative service providers.  We focus our consumer-related activities on issues where there has been greatest harm to consumers, and those areas which have given rise to the greatest number of complaints to ComReg.  In recent years, the main issues we have been dealing with have involved matters such as billing, switching, customer contracts and problems with premium rate services.  The following are examples of actions we have taken.  The information we provide to consumers assists them to make informed choices.  To this end we have: conducted awareness campaigns to inform consumers about areas such as complaints handling, mobile experience, premium rate services, among others; and published statistics relating to the number of complaints and queries received by ComReg&rsquo;s consumer line.  We have broken these statistics down to give information on a per-operator basis.<br\/><br\/>Our consumer line deals with individual queries from consumers.  This includes informing them about their general rights regarding how to complain to their operators and how to escalate complaints to ComReg if they are not satisfied.  We provide online interactive tools and information such as our price comparison tool and our mobile coverage map.  We make sure that consumers have redress when things go wrong.  For example, we require service providers to have a code of practice for complaints handling.  The codes of practice must include a telephone number and other channels for logging complaints.  They must adhere to maximum timelines for dealing with complaints and they must inform customers that they can complain to ComReg if they are not satisfied with the complaint resolution.<br\/><br\/>When customers are not satisfied with the way an operator has resolved their complaint, they can escalate the complaint to ComReg.  We then contact the service provider on the customer&rsquo;s behalf.  The complaint is typically reviewed by the service provider&rsquo;s escalation team.  Consumers who wish to call ComReg&rsquo;s line can dial 01-8049668 or email ComReg at <i>consumerline@comreg.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>ComReg offers dispute resolution for consumers who remain dissatisfied with their operator&rsquo;s response generally, after all the complaint handling procedures have been exhausted.  We ensure that consumers can switch providers easily in order that they may exercise choice and take advantage of alternative offers from competitors.  To this end, we have implemented EU law mandating number portability for fixed and mobile phones so that customers can change service provider without having to get a new number.  Customers can deal exclusively with their new provider and the new provider will cancel their old service on their behalf.  We also ensure compliance with EU law mandating that customers should not be penalised for switching if they are out of contract and that there are no other unreasonable barriers to switching.<br\/><br\/>When service providers fulfil their consumer obligations, this benefits their customers and it reduces the number of queries and complaints that their call centres have to deal with.  ComReg takes enforcement action when we consider that service providers are not fulfilling their obligations.  In the past two years, we concluded and published the details of over 25 cases of non-compliance, including prosecutions and substantial fines.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to the recent problems with Eir customer care.  We have experienced a growth in complaints to ComReg this year, largely as a result of consumers complaining about problems contacting Eir.  In the first nine months of 2020, ComReg has resolved 5,354 complaints, two thirds of which, 3,477, came from Eir customers.  ComReg has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact on customers.  We continue to ensure that our contact centre was able to answer queries from Eir customers, including informing them about how to complain to Eir and that they can complain to ComReg if they are unable to make contact with Eir.  We provide information on our website, including the phone number and web address for submitting complaints to Eir.  The web address is <i>www.comreg.ie<\/i>.  We continue to engage on a fortnightly basis with the Eir CEO to understand the status of its care operation and the remediation plans.  It is important to note that it is Eir&rsquo;s responsibility to fix the underlying problems with its customer care operation.  It is Eir that hires and trains care agents, decides on their mandates and incentives and provides the IT systems.  ComReg will continue to press Eir to resolve these matters expeditiously.<br\/><br\/>Looking to the future, and in light of the significant problems with Eir&rsquo;s call answering times, we have considered what additional steps we could take, and what additional powers would be useful.  This consideration has taken into account the changes to the regulatory framework that will come into force when the new European electronic communications code is transposed into Irish law.  This new European legislation will replace much of ComReg's existing legislation for electronic communications.  The new laws will consolidate and reform the framework for the regulation of telecommunications regulations across the EU.  In this directive, telecommunications are called electronic communications services, ECS, and electronic communications networks, ECN.<br\/><br\/>In terms of information provision, we consider that it would be useful to provide consumers with more information on matters such as quality of service and customer care complaint resolution metrics.  This initiative will not only ensure transparency but will also ensure that the data we publish is meaningful and comparable.<br\/><br\/>In terms of complaint handling, we are monitoring whether service providers are implementing their codes of practice.  We consider that it would be useful for legislation to provide for specific sanctions and consequences when service providers fail to implement their complaint handling codes, both generally and in the case of individual customers.<br\/><br\/>In terms of service providers other obligations, the European electronic communications code will give consumers some useful new rights, including transparency on contract terms, rights when switching broadband service and in respect of missed appointments.  We have already published initial advice to service providers on how they should interpret end user obligations in anticipation of the implementation of the code.  There are also consumer rights granted by the unfair commercial practices directive.  ComReg does not have the power to enforce these rights for consumers of electronic communications services and we consider that this would be a useful addition to our responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>It is important that ComReg should be in a position to impose much larger sanctions that would be a genuine deterrent to non-compliance.  This would give service providers a greater incentive to proactively uphold end user rights, rather than to come into compliance only after ComReg has taken action.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to give ComReg the power to impose administrative financial penalties.  We welcome this commitment by the Government and other parties and we hope that this important legislative change can be implemented as soon as possible.  Promoting the interests of consumers is a core part of ComReg&rsquo;s reason for being.  The recent problems faced by Eir customers in contacting customer care are completely unacceptable.  We have used our existing powers as much as we can to assist customers and we are in discussions with the Government about what additional powers would be useful.<br\/><br\/>I want to mention the efforts of thousands of employees across the whole telecommunications industry, who have worked tirelessly during the pandemic to ensure that customers and businesses have been able to use the Internet to support work, education and social life.  These workers have made a major contribution to the well-being of society and Eir's recent customer care problems do not invalidate the value of their work.  We will be pleased to answer any questions that members have and I thank the committee for allowing me to make this statement of behalf of ComReg.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020120900002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607472000,"counter":984,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Blaney for his presentation.

It is important that ComReg imposes an administrative fine and financial sanction.

The first concerns an email that came in the other day from a company in Ennis.  The VAT reduction rate announced on 1 September has not been passed on to them and what they have seen in their bills since September is that the tariff has gone up and the VAT has come down.  Basically, they are paying the exact same bill so they have adjusted their tariff and reduced the VAT.  That is immoral.  That VAT reduction was brought about just across from us in the D&aacute;il a few short weeks ago to alleviate pressures felt by individuals and companies during this time of economic ravage brought on by Covid-19.  It is immoral that Eir continues to do that.  It is wrong that it has adjusted tariffs without any communication with its customer base, as far as I can see.  It has adjusted it so that one is paying the same at the end of the month.  The same amount leaves one's bank account.  That is wrong.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that.<\/p> <p>  Second, as others were speaking I was going through the mobile phone coverage map of the nation, which has various colour codings signalling areas with good and bad coverage and no coverage in some cases.  It is broken down by company.  I made the point at our previous meeting that in some parts of County Clare there is a proliferation of mobile phone masts.  There could be ten or 12 in a small community and companies apply to extend these 6 m masts to 12 m and they sell space very lucratively to competitors.  In the rural parts of the county there is no coverage.  If someone goes off to work they are entirely uncontactable to family and whoever else might need to reach them if they go to western or northern parts of the county.  That is wrong.  The companies are not fulfilling their full obligations.  This does not come down to 4G, 5G and that crazy debate that happens online and at the fringes of society.  It is not about that; it is about some populated communities being overloaded with infrastructure when they already have super coverage and other communities being cast aside.<\/p> <p>  The final issue I want to raise is that of eircodes.  I believe that issue is not fully within the ComReg's remit but, nonetheless, eircodes are a prerequisite for homeowners in Ireland to get connected to the Internet.  There is something fundamentally flawed in that.  We have debated in this committee the situation where they generate eircodes on a quarterly basis.  If one does not get taken into that net of eircode generation one is cast aside for a few months and left without broadband at a time when it is crucial that people are enabled to work from home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020120900002#L02100","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607472000,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Delaney to cover the issue on the VAT.

We believe this is a very important issue.  People having connectivity on the move is very important.  It is a matter that the previous committee discussed with ComReg quite often.  One of the things we have done is provide the coverage maps.  Some people may have good coverage from one operator but not from another so it is easy for them to choose the right operator.  We have done a few things to help people with indoor service, as I mentioned earlier.  While we are all very happy to have better service in more populous communities, we are concerned about communities being left behind.  We did some studies and to cover 100% of the land area of Ireland would be phenomenally expensive.  We are in a forthcoming spectrum auction so probably in the first or second quarter next year we will have major licence awards.  One of the important characteristics of that will be the coverage obligations that go with those new licences.  We have proposed much more demand in coverage obligations than have been in previous licences.<\/p><p>We will ask operators to provide a 3 Mbps service to 99% of the population and 92% of the geographic area of Ireland, and a 30 Mbps service, which is a much faster service, to 95% of the population, as well as to cover areas like motorways, primary roads and specific locations like business and technology parks, hospitals, higher education campuses, transport hubs, and visitor attractions.

As a national regulator, ComReg needs to watch and scrutinise the whole principle of co-location because it became a buzzword in planning about nine years ago, but it seems to have dropped off.  Mobile phone companies are flaunting it.  They are driven by the profits.  I think it costs about &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 per unit space one rents on a mast.
