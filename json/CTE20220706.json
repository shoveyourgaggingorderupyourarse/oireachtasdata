As a bookshop, we will try to describe some of the issues which affect us and therefore the wider trade in stocking books in the Irish language.  In Dublin, there are very few bookshops that devote more than a shelf or two to Irish language books.  Ourselves and An Siopa Leabhar on Harcourt Street have a larger range than most.  Why is this?  Most bookshops have a very small surface area and must maximise sales per square foot.  Devoting a percentage of this space to Irish language books is a risk that some of these shops are not willing to take as the returns from sales may not materialise.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is supply.  Most books in the Irish language are distributed by &Aacute;is&iacute;neacht D&aacute;ileach&aacute;in Leabhar, &Aacute;IS, which does an admirable job in supplying the trade and beyond with Irish language books.  However, ordering can only be done by email and telephone.  The industry standard is to use teleorder, an electronic ordering system which uses sales or databases used by bookshops.  Not using this standard makes it time consuming for the bookshop to place orders as the data has to be transferred from the catalogue to email or even to read out over the phone.<\/p><p>It is just time-consuming for people to place orders and we are all pressed for time.  As was mentioned before, &Aacute;is also does not have a searchable website through which orders can be made.  That is one of the more important things it could do.<br\/><br\/>The international standard for the identification of books is the International Standard Book Number, ISBN.  It is essentially a product identifier used by publishers, booksellers, libraries, Internet retailers and other supply chain participants for ordering, listing, sales records and stock control purposes.  The ISBN identifies the registrant as well as the specific title, edition and format.  Not all Irish book publishers conform to this standard, which causes issues in reordering and selling of books through electronic point of sale systems.  Wholesale adoption of this standard would make it easier to reorder and identify sales.<br\/><br\/>There is vibrant and active publishing in the Irish language.  It is concentrated on children's publishing in the main, then on Irish learning products and then on adult publishing.  There appears to be a gap in publishing for those over the age of 10 with little being published for teenagers and young adults.  The teenage and young adult market is one of the strongest growing and, in some ways, bravest parts of English language publishing.  It tackles complex societal issues that are not tackled through the mainstream educational system.  Adult publishing is also not diverse enough.  There is a lot of poetry but fewer new fiction voices.  Investment to help publishers market, design and commission new work is necessary, as is support for the writers who choose to write in Irish.  Cover design in Irish language publishing has been poor but is improving.  It needs to appeal to a more visually conscious younger audience.<br\/><br\/>Some of the most successful books over recent years have been accounts of the joys of learning Irish and books telling of the influence Irish has had on the English language.  All of these books were written in English but never translated into Irish.  <i>Motherfocl&oacute;ir<\/i>is an example.  Established publishers in English, including Penguin Ireland, Hachette Ireland, HarperCollins and Gill Books, need to be encouraged to produce books in Irish as part of their offer and encouraged to do translations.  Some Irish publishers have produced fine translations of novels in English, French and numerous other languages.  This in one way to allow readers to experience the familiar in the unfamiliar.  Co-ordination is needed between curriculum developers and publishers to update the curriculum to keep it relevant.  Some texts have been on the curriculum for 20 years, for example, <i>Cith is Deal&aacute;n<\/i>.  It is a wonderful book but I used it in school in 1979 and I do not know if it has any relevance to children today.<br\/><br\/>Irish language novels should be submitted for international awards to raise the profile of the language.  We seem not to celebrate these writers by bringing them to a much wider audience outside of this country.  Considering the amount of space given to books in English in all media including print, television and radio, the amount given to books in Irish seems minimal.  It feels ghettoised, with the main review coverage in <i>Comhar<\/i>and once a year in <i>Books Ireland<\/i>towards the end of the year.  That is the limit of the review coverage of Irish language books.  National newspapers do not review Irish language books as often as they should.  Neither does TV or radio.  TG4's last books programme was in 2018.  Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta has some but not many.  The last local radio station coverage I know of was a show on Donegal's Ocean FM, &quot;Duilleoga&quot;, in 2019.  That was the only one I could see in recent years.  We also need to encourage the use of TikTok, Instagram and so on to promote the books to a younger audience.  Having looked at the Seachtain na Gaeilge website, it seems that it is primarily concerned with the spoken language.  The website does not celebrate the written word at all, with the exception of a paragraph saying that we have a long and glorious tradition of writing in Ireland.  Irish language publishing is active and vibrant but suffers from a lack of visibility in shops and libraries.  There is no reason that this cannot be reversed through a more dynamic relationship between the shops, publishers and libraries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022070600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Donnelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657062000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Mr. Donnelly managed to struggle through without his glasses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022070600002#C00200","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657062000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an chuiridh agus as an deis a bheith anseo inniu.

Cloistear comhr&aacute; Gaeilge sa siopa gach l&aacute;.<\/p> <p>  Sna 1950id&iacute;, thosaigh muid ag easp&oacute;rt&aacute;il.  Chuir muid roinnt catal&oacute;g le ch&eacute;ile ag an am sin agus iad ar fad i nGaeilge.  &Oacute; shin i leith, t&aacute; daoine thar lear ag lorg leabhair i nGaeilge.  Mh&eacute;adaigh an saghas gn&oacute; sin nuair a thosaigh muid ag taistil do na St&aacute;it Aontaithe sna 1960id&iacute; ag tabhairt cuairt ar leabharlanna agus ollscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re sin agus go h&aacute;irithe nuair a chuaigh muid ar an Idirl&iacute;on.  Ceathracha bliain &oacute; shin, toghadh muid mar phr&iacute;omhshol&aacute;thr&oacute;ir leabhar Gaeilge agus leabhar B&eacute;arla don Library of Congress i Washington, an leabharlann is m&oacute; ar domhan.  Thosaigh muid an rud c&eacute;anna in an-chuid de na pr&iacute;omh-ollscoileanna sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe tr&iacute; na blianta, Notre Dame agus Harvard ina measc.  Mar gheall air seo, chruthaigh muid margadh t&aacute;bhachtach do leabhair Ghaeilge sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; seo agus i measc daoine pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha thar lear freisin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar sprioc againn an l&iacute;on leabharlann agus institi&uacute;id&iacute; seo a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;.<\/p> <p>  In 1994, thosaigh muid ag d&iacute;ol ar l&iacute;ne.  Is muidne an siopa leabhar is faide ar an Idirl&iacute;on ar domhan.  Anuraidh, sheol muid leabhair chuig 160 t&iacute;r difri&uacute;la ar fud an domhain.  In&aacute;r siopa i nGaillimh, t&aacute; thart ar 25,000 leabhar Gaeilge ar d&iacute;ol.  Ina measc sin, t&aacute; seanleabhair, leabhair &aacute;thl&aacute;imhe agus leabhair nua.  T&aacute; seans ann go bhfuil an baili&uacute;ch&aacute;n is m&oacute; leabhar Gaeilge ar d&iacute;ol sa domhan againn.  Gach bliain, d&iacute;olaimid na m&iacute;lte leabhar Gaeilge do chustaim&eacute;ir&iacute; in &Eacute;irinn agus thar lear sa siopa agus ar l&iacute;ne.  In&aacute;r dtuairim, t&aacute; a l&aacute;n deiseanna ann n&iacute;os m&oacute; leabhar Gaeilge a dh&iacute;ol ach t&aacute; a l&aacute;n fadhbanna ag spreagadh muid &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh go h&eacute;ifeachtach.  T&aacute; mo dhearth&aacute;ir, Tom&aacute;s Kenny, chun caint leis an gcoiste faoi seo anois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022070600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657062000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an chuiridh seo.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm go mbeidh m&eacute; ag caint i mB&eacute;arla because this is something I am very passionate about and I would not be able to get my point across as eloquently in Irish.  I have been selling books in Kenny's for 21 years.  There are effectively three parts to the puzzle.  There is the publishing of the book, its distribution and marketing and its sale.  I will talk a little bit about each of the three.<\/p> <p>  There is very good State funding for publishers and there is an awful lot of books published in Irish.  It is almost comparable to the number of books published in English on the island, which is remarkable given the relative size of the two readerships.  However, there are issues with what is published.  To echo what everyone has said thus far, that fact that some publishers do not use ISBNs is a nightmare because this does not allow books to be inputted into book databases and the point of sale systems that nearly every bookshop in the world uses.<\/p><p>It just makes it awkward and more difficult for anyone to stock.  The books are generally more expensive than their English counterparts of the same size.  As Liam Donnelly has said, the design, the quality of the paper and the number of illustrations are to a lower standard than one would find in comparable English-language publications.  I suspect the reason for that is it is an awful lot cheaper to publish the way it is being published, because, in all too many cases, the publishers do not think they have a saleable product and do not particularly care about selling it.  It is more about getting the item published than it is anything beyond that.<\/p><p> Distribution is a very big issue.  &Aacute;IS's IT system is extremely poor.  It has a wonderful staff who do what they can.  It has moved very recently and has a better-functioning warehouse.  I would say it has moved from one old software system to a new software system and all of its data is corrupted.  The reason it does not have a searchable database - it has sent me a list of every book it has in stock &ndash; is it does not know what it has in stock.  For example, in the &ldquo;Title&rdquo; column, it has authors, ISBNs or data publication, which is a nightmare.  You cannot look through it.<\/p><p> For us, and for others, we want a scenario such as the Easons or Amazon websites where they have the books for sale.  It cannot be for sale if there is no database to work from.  There are approximately 6,000 books in &Aacute;IS at present.  We have approximately 1,800 of those on the site, because that is all we could extract from the data that it sent us, which is shockingly poor, but it is not a particularly difficult problem to solve.  We deal with millions of books, had this issue and solved it in months.  I do not see any reason it could not be improved with a bit more help for &Aacute;IS.<\/p><p> With regard to sale of the book, Futa Fata is the only Irish-language publisher in the country which operates outside of this &Aacute;IS system and it has a sales representative which is not directly linked with &Aacute;IS.  I get information about everything that Futa Fata publishes.  We stock virtually everything that it publishes.  Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in comes into me to tell me what Futa Fata is publishing.  With the exception of Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in, in 21 years I have not once had a publisher come in to me to tell me what it has for sale, what it can sell, how it can do it, that it could bring in an author etc.  There is not one day goes by that I do not have an English-language publisher come into us with regard to what it can do, how it can do it or to ask how it can improve.  There is a complete and utter lack of interest or effort from Irish-language publishers to get their books to a readership.  We have been lead to believe in our conversations that, effectively, they see us as a threat to a direct sale through them.  If we are based in Galway and they are based 20 miles away and we sell a book in our shop, they consider it a sale that could have gone to them.<\/p><p> In a similar sense, the discounts that Irish-language publishers offer, which are standard and have not changed in 30 or 40 years, are a little over half of what we would get from English-language publishers.  The bookshops that the committee has here today are all ideologically driven towards having Irish-language books, but if a bookshop is not so driven or is in a county that might not be traditionally considered a hotbed of Gaeltacht activity, there is no reason for it to stock these books.  They cost more, sell less and the shop gets less margin on each book sold.  There is no incentive whatsoever.<\/p><p> At the moment, all of the incentive is driven towards the publishers to publish the books.  I have no issue with that.  It is as it should be.  There is some effort going towards helping &Aacute;IS, but not enough.  It is effectively operating a 1970s or 1980s model in a digital world.  There are absolutely no resources whatsoever towards bookshops to bring in authors or to have events.  I suspect that the lack comes both from the State and the publishers themselves.<\/p><p> In the past three years, we have sold Irish-language books to 29 different countries and to every single county on the island.  There is an untapped market for these books that is untapped, but the current system puts obstacles to selling them in our way, instead of solutions.  If I can in any way facilitate a change in this or a solution, I am happy to offer any help I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022070600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657062000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>T&aacute; roinnt point&iacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;la ardaithe ansin.

Five major publishers run it.  They give the same discounts, returns terms and price increases.  I can almost guarantee the price will increase by 5% every January.  We left the textbook business 35 years ago, but I have experienced, when working with Easons and running its textbook division, that the same problems occur all of the time.  The cartel - I am sorry to say - I think is between Gill, CJ Fallon, Edco and Folens.  There is another one I have forgotten.  They run it the same way.  There are price increases every year.  They change their text books every two or three years, sometimes as a basis of curriculum change, but often not.  Sometimes, it is just because they can.  I have never understood why they were allowed to run it like this.<br\/><br\/>Easons, to be fair, is the main supplier of textbooks in the country.  Most bookshops cannot afford to do them.  The discount is 25%.  There is a 5% returns cap, which means that if one buys &euro;100 worth of books and sell &euro;50 worth, one can only return 5% and is still stuck with 50%.  One has &euro;45 worth of books in the shop that one can never sell.  The publishers might change the following year and the textbook will be different.  They run it that way and it is very difficult to make money.  Easons is the only one that has really made a good fist of it.  Some small shops are able to do it and, certainly, <i>textbooks.ie<\/i>has done a fantastic job of it online.  However, the changing over of textbooks is a real issue, not just in Irish.  It does not matter what the subject is.  That is probably beyond the purview of this committee.  I find it problematic how those publishers run their business.<br\/><br\/>Every bookshop has stock sitting on the shelf for years.  With regard to Irish books, we never return books to the Irish publishers, especially not to &Aacute;IS.  We buy them and we have them.  After two or three years, accounting wise, they mean nothing.  They have been written off.  I would sell them off cheap and get in new books.  We will price promote to sell the stock on.  Eventually, you will find it for &euro;1 in a bargain bin.  It will go and we will never buy it again.  We might not be able to identify it, of course, because it would not have an ISBN, but we can then buy fresh stock.<br\/><br\/>We will always keep our core Irish stock in place.<\/p><p>Some books of poetry by obscure poets, or very badly-produced books, just die.  The good ones, however, keep on selling, which is always encouraging.  The reason we stock the books is that they are good, especially in children's publishing.  It is fantastic.  Futa Fata does fantastic work.  Many of the mainstream Irish publishers, such as Gill, do some great books as Gaeilge, which we never return.  However, there is a real issue in adult publishing with bad books that people do not want to buy but we buy them because we do not know.  We have never read them.  We do not get a chance to read every book.  One has to make a judgment and we buy one or two.  If they do not sell, they do not sell.<\/p><p> We do not sell e-books.  That is not our business.  We are in the physical domain.  However, it is a cost issue for a publisher.  Producing a CD is very expensive.  Possibly the best avenue for publishers to release their material is through Audible or on the Internet, in order that it can be downloaded onto a USB stick, but not as a physical CD.  It is just too expensive to do it.  As Gr&aacute;inne N&iacute; Mhuilneoir said, many of the translations that are coming up are done by robots.<\/p><p> It is like many Irish texts one will find on the Internet if one looks for obscure, old Irish texts.  They are produced by photocopying machines.  They are terrible and they do the book industry a disservice.  It is very important that they should be produced and people should be assisted in providing the readers and making it happen, but not as a physical CD.  They should be produced via Audible, or through an Irish-language service for books as Gaeilge, in order that they do not get lost in the morass of English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022070600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Donnelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657062000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Liam Donnelly has very ably described the Irish textbook market there.  From an Irish-language point of view, as well as a problem with education textbooks, regular fiction books on the curriculum are quite often not in print.  When I was doing my leaving certificate, we did <i>Scothsc&eacute;alta<\/i>by P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire.  There was a P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire statue on Eyre Square, there still is kind of, and busloads of American tourists used to come in to say that their grandfather had read P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire and to ask to buy it.  I would say that all of my classmates wanted to buy it and cannot find it.  I remember that &Aacute;IS rang me.  I used to ring &Aacute;IS, because I did not know who had published it originally to ask if someone could reprint it, that we could sell loads.  Approximately two or three years later, I got a phone call to say it had found two pallettes of Scothsc&eacute;alta down the back that nobody had realised were there.  It is funny in a way, but it also goes back to what we are dealing with.  It is the case across the board.  Most of the top 20, 40 or 50 books in Irish, in the history of the Irish language, are not in print.  If one wants to come into buy a classic, it is difficult.  I am straying from the Cathaoirleach's question.<br\/><br\/>We do not deal with the e-book market.  I have no idea what the costs are.  There is obviously a cost involved with transferring it.  We sell CDs.  We obviously have nothing to do with Audible, or whatever, which is how most people would access audiobooks.  However, there is a market because much Irish-language reading that we encounter is aspirational in many respects.  Many people read aspirational audiobooks on long commutes, such as that difficult science book I will never read.  I imagine the same applies to Irish, but that is only a personal opinion.<br\/><br\/>In terms of stock on shelves, we have many leabhair Ghaeilge.  We have second-hand, rare and new books.  We have multiple copies of 80% to 90% of the books that were ever published.  I was saying to Gr&aacute;inne N&iacute; Mhuilneoir before we began, that we had Conradh na Gaeilge pamphlets from 1899, 1900 and 1901 that my grandad bought when Conradh na Gaeilge moved its shop on O'Connell Street in the 1970s.  We still have them 55 years later, but he probably thought it was a fantastic deal.  We would never get rid of or return them or return them because it as an ideological point.  It is also a point of difference, to be perfectly honest, from a commercial point of view.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.  There are very few people who sell books in Irish.  It is good to do so because it brings people in the door.  There is a market there, even if people are not always aware of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022070600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1657062000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as an ionchur iontach ionraic at&aacute; tugtha acu go dt&iacute; seo.

The English-language publishers come into us to talk about their big titles that are up and coming for the coming season.  We will look at the ones we think will sell well and buy them into the shop.  We will work with the publishers to do promotions on some of those titles and to get some of the authors to come into the shop to do readings, interviews and signings.<\/p><p>We put videos up on our Youtube channel and put promotions for titles and authors on our social media.  We might send a press release to try to get an interview with the author on local radio.  All of that puts it to the forefront of the general public.  If the authors and publishers also contribute to that and do a marketing campaign, like the English language publishers do for all their titles, with interviews on national radio and with local media, that gets the books out into the media and onto social media, where a younger audience will view them.  That would do a huge amount.  None of that happens at the moment because we are not getting the engagement directly from the publishers as the incentive is not there for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022070600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657062000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Far greater penetration into <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, TG4 or whatever is pointless if people cannot access the book after the fact.  That is part of the problem now because we are all at a loss as to knowing what is being published.  There is no point in TG4 having a new show unless the distribution side of it is fixed.  Sarah Kenny is absolutely right.  There are definitely possibilities.  <i>Madame Lazare<\/i>by Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in won an EU prize.  That was published a year ago and won an EU prize for literature for the island of Ireland.  We were offered funding by that EU prize to put on an event and do marketing around it.  We have never, in 82 years, been approached by anybody in Ireland to do anything like that about Irish language books, whereas we have for English language ones.  It took an EU organisation to look to fund it in any way, shape or form.  Nobody is looking for handouts or anything like that but there is a recognition in English language poetry, for example, that it is not necessarily viable commercially and yet there are poetry readings everywhere because they are funded, rightfully, by the Arts Council.  The same is not true in an Irish language capacity, despite there being people out there who are willing, capable and able to do it.<br\/><br\/>There is a way forward for audiobooks.  The best way of spreading Irish might be podcasting as much as anything else.  I know we are talking about publishing and books but that is the way most people consume their media now, certainly for my age bracket and all my friends and family.  There are possibilities there.  The one thing there is no lack of is the actual creation itself.  There is so much material there to sell and to have and there are immensely talented people doing it on the writing and the publishing side.  The will is there from everybody, from &Aacute;is to Foras na Gaeilge, but as I said earlier, it is an analogue model in a digital world.

Hachette has three, with two more sitting in the offices as support.  &Aacute;is does not have the support.  &Aacute;is is only a distributor but it communicates most with us.  The individual publishers do not communicate with us.  The most successful event I have ever done with an Irish language publisher was with Futa Fata.  Its representatives were willing to come from Galway to do an Irish language event for children.  It was fantastic because they came but it is expensive for a publisher to decant five or six people.  This is simply about being in the shop and celebrating a book, not anything else.  Decanting four or five people from Galway to Dublin for the day and back is an expense and small publishers cannot afford to do it.  Big English and Irish publishers can but it is difficult for the smaller ones.  That is a very simple form of marketing without involving newspapers and stuff like that.  It is about getting to the bookshop with an author and celebrating the book.  That is an expense and some way or other English publishers are able to absorb that expense and make it an easy thing for them to do.<\/p> <p>  As Sarah Kenny rightly said, Irish language publishers do not engage enough with the bookshops.  If somebody came to me with a fantastic author and asked me to do an event, I would do it straight off.  That is a simple form of marketing.  Besides national press, radio, television and all that other stuff, having the actual physical body in the shop is the most important thing.  The publishers are not going to bring authors to me.  Every day I get requests from UK and Irish publishers in English to say they have somebody coming over and asking if we could we have an event.  We have three events a week launching books or celebrating them - it does not really matter what the event is - but they are all in English.  The one time I worked with Futa Fata, which was five years ago, it was fantastic.  We had 60 children and it was just brilliant.  It was a celebration of a book.  Since then there has been nothing.  It has been radio silence.  That is because they are either afraid or they do not want to spend a little bit of money.  Maybe that is something we could do.<\/p> <p>  With regard to overall marketing, even a poster in a window of a shop helps.  I have never had one from anybody except Futa Fata.  A simple poster in a shop window does wonders.  It is the simplest form or marketing.  People walk by and see it.  This is something I have never understood.  &Aacute;is could produce them but it does not.  The publishers are responsible for doing that.  They could even send me a PDF and I would pay for the poster but it does not happen.  I find it odd.<\/p> <p>  With regard to audiobooks, it needs to be an ecosystem.  It has to be encouraged somehow to get people to read the books and record them.  It is not an expensive process; it just takes time.  It takes 15 hours to read a book into a microphone and then it can be distributed all over the world but it is about getting people to do it, getting the right books and finding the right reader.  The reader is the most important thing.  If the book was read by me everybody would fall asleep but if it was read by someone who can engage properly in the language it would be fantastic.<\/p><p>However, that does not happen.  It is not our purview as booksellers but it is something the publishers could look at or club together to do.  A recording studio does not cost that much for 15 hours.  It is just a case of finding the right reader and the right book and using their skills, if they have them, in publicity to show people that it is out there.

The purpose of this meeting is to seek the approval of the select committee to reallocate &euro;30 million in savings from subhead D3, which relates to the national broadband plan, to subhead B13, which relates to emergency generation capacity.<\/p> <p>  On 7 June 2022, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure around 450 MW of additional generation capacity for winter 2023-24 through to winter 2025-26 to offset a potential capacity shortfall of electricity supply.  In order for EirGrid to be able comply with this direction in the next few weeks, financial support needs to be provided by my Department to the company.  Legislation to ensure that EirGrid can carry out this direction, including the legal basis for my Department providing the necessary financial support, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas yesterday and is expected to be signed into law by the President in the coming days.<\/p> <p>  The level of financial support required in 2022 to allow EirGrid place orders on the electricity generation units and ensure that they are delivered and installed in time for winter 2023-24 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;350 million.  As the final level of financial support required this year will not be fully known until later in the summer when all the contractual arrangements in place, it has been agreed that approval of the allocation of funding for the emergency generation capacity will be requested in two tranches, namely, the current allocation request of &euro;200 million and a subsequent request later in the year for approval of the balance of the funding to be allocated.  The second Supplementary Estimate to be provided later this year will take account of the final agreed figures for the purchase and installation of the equipment and any further savings arising in my Department based on projected year-end expenditure.<\/p><p>As I mentioned, the overall purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allocate &euro;200 million to a new subhead B13, in the energy transformation programme, to fund the purchase by EirGrid of additional emergency generation capacity.  The &euro;200 million being allocated is comprised of &euro;110 million in additional funding from the Exchequer and &euro;90 million from a reallocation of savings within my Department.  Some &euro;30 million is being reallocated from savings on subhead D3, which is the national broadband plan, and &euro;60 million is from forecasted capital underspend in the energy transformation programme.<\/p><p> My Department has agreed an updated interim remedial plan with National Broadband Ireland to take account of the knock-on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the programme.  Under this plan, the revised target has reduced from 130,000 to 102,000 premises to be passed by the end of January 2023.  This has resulted in reduced 2022 projected expenditure with a mid-term forecast of &euro;30 million in underspending at the end of the year.  It remains the ambition of the Government to roll out the national broadband plan State-led intervention as quickly as possible in all areas.  To achieve this, National Broadband Ireland will continue its focus on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the build programme gets back on track.<\/p><p> Following the announcement by Government earlier this year of an enhanced package of measures to support the uptake of home energy upgrades, demand for the SEAI residential energy efficiency schemes has been strong, with double the number of applications seen in 2021.  It is expected that the pipeline of applications will result in high levels of delivery for the remainder of the year.  However, indicative mid-year results from the SEAI show a forecasted underspend at the end of the year on the one-stop shop and community energy schemes.  While the targeted number of houses will be started in 2022, it is anticipated that not all of these will be completed and certified for payment this year due to supply chain constraints.  It is expected that the pipeline of applications in 2022 will result in strong levels of delivery next year.<\/p><p> The &euro;400 million allocated to the electricity credit included a contingency to cover the possible cost arising from growth in the number of domestic household accounts in excess of the original 2.15 million forecast.  The final cost of the electricity credit was just under &euro;380 million, leaving a saving of &euro;20 million to be reallocated to the emergency generation capacity subhead.

That carbon tax is being siphoned off to pay for backup electricity generated by fossil fuel.  That demand is induced by data centres and Government policy.  Customers, many of them living in poverty, will pay a premium for that.  It is a perverse scenario I find quite incredible and is a clear indictment of a failed Government policy.

For background to this issue, in the past week, the European Council made a decision.  It has to be ratified by the European Parliament but I do not expect it will be blocked.  The decision is that Europe will introduce a form of carbon tax in the transport and building sector.  If we are not applying our carbon tax and increasing it in the way that we have committed to, then the funds would go away.  We would not have the funds for retrofitting, social welfare increases and for farming.

That is part of the plan and we will need it.  It will use less gas because it is only there for back-up, but we need it.<\/p> <p>  We will not know the exact cost to the consumer.  There are all sorts of estimates, which depend on what one counts and how it is measured.  We could ask what the costs would have been had our auctions been successful in the first place.  This emergency generation seeks to catch up with that.  There would have been an underlying cost.  We would have needed this backup, but we were not able to deliver it in the auction process, so we are taking the purchase route.  Whether one counts that or not, the reality is that we will not know until we purchase the equipment, agree on the installation at sites, and know the related costs.  A cost of &euro;40 was mentioned on Committee Stage.  I think that will be less.  It depends on the purchase price of the generation equipment and the installation price at the sites, which will then accrue.<\/p> <p>  Any figures we mentioned do not take into account the plan that we would be able to get a resale value and clawback for households and taxpayers in the event that the equipment can be sold at the end of its use in this emergency way.

The 20% reduction in public transport fares has been a great success.  My understanding from the National Transport Authority, NTA, is that there has been an uplift of approximately 15% in Limerick compared with figures pre-Covid.  It has been a resounding success.  There have been unintended consequences, however.  The 307 bus route goes from Limerick city to the University of Limerick, UL, and then up Castletroy College Road.  The 308 bus route goes out to UL and then to Groody Road and comes back via Ballysimon.  Those routes are important as they serve the university.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also has bus routes serving UL, namely, the 304 and 304A routes.

When we contacted the NTA regarding this matter, however, we did not get a reply indicating how it is done.  The NTA just stated that it would refund the money on the basis that this individual had not been told he or she would not be able to take the test.<\/p> <p>  We all know that every town in Ireland is crying out for people to drive taxis.  We have a number of individuals who are willing to do it.  A number of people fall into that bracket and are licensed, but they will also fall into the Northern licence bracket in the next while.  The fact is that we do not need an Irish solution whereby people get a Southern licences on the basis of having southern addresses when they actually live in the North.  That is grand until they are stopped in their own vehicle on which there is a Northern number plate.  There are also a pile of difficulties relating to customs and all the rest.  What needs to be done to sort this out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022070600002#H00600","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1657062000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I do not have the answer now.

We will consider how that can be influenced to try to deliver on the regional balance we all want to see, but it needs to be more than that.<\/p> <p>  NTA representatives were before the committee for a very good session a couple of weeks ago.  I am very concerned about the taxi industry and late nights.  As a senior Minister, he needs to address the taxi industry in the first instance but also broader public transport services out of hours or late at night, as does his colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, in the context of the late-night economy.  I am not satisfied that the NTA is on top of the matter, is responding adequately or is prepared to respond adequately.  It needs considerable attention.  That will become more apparent as time goes by.  Maybe I am wrong, but it requires ongoing attention.<\/p> <p>  I am hearing concerns from colleagues throughout the country regarding some of the public transport services, especially some of those provided by Go-Ahead Ireland.  I have raised this with the NTA, as have my colleagues, but it is something that will require particular attention.  There are challenges across the board in delivering services because of driver recruitment and retention issues.  There are particular problems in that area that need to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022070600002#H01200","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1657062000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I will add a point on taxis.  This is anecdotal, but we are hearing that prior to Covid many taxi drivers did late-night work.  Post Covid, the number doing late-night work has dropped.  That appears to be a factor.  I have noticed that in Dublin people are now waiting for taxis when a short time ago they were not.  The committee will probably do a body of work around this but I will add to Deputy O'Rourke's question.  I ask the Minister to address his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022070600002#H01300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1657062000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>There are so many sectors coming out of Covid.  It is like leaving a machine idle for two years.  It is not that taxi drivers were idle, but now that everything has started back up again full tilt, we are finding it is difficult for a variety of sectors to get back.  As the Chairman said, the pattern changed during that two-year period.  Many older drivers have left.  Many of those who previously worked nights are not doing so now.  My city of Dublin, as the Chairman said, it had a very large fleet.  We had a large number of licensed taxis.  It was meeting demand and need.  It is now out of kilter and needs to get back into kilter.<\/p> <p>  It is not just taxis.  One of the things we are seeing is that the roll-out of BusConnects routes is allowing for late-night services.  We need more public transport services at night.  It is not just the taxi industry that should take all the people.  One of the issues in the likes of Dublin Airport is that many of the commercial bus services that went to the airport have not come back for a variety of reasons, including the 20% fare reduction discount issue.  A complex range of issues is part of this.  Deputy O'Rourke is correct that what we are seeing as we come out of Covid is various sectors, such as aviation, the taxi industry and much of construction contracting, are finding it difficult to get staff so many of them are finding it very difficult to ramp back up.  We will have to make sure they do in order to provide the service the public demands. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022070600002#H01400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1657062000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>To round off on that, I will ask about the 20% reduction in public transport fares in respect of public service obligation routes.  I worry about the private operators, many of whom applied to the NTA for many years, and in many cases, pioneered the setting up of routes.  I would hate to see unintended consequences where customers are not getting the level of service they previously got because these private operators are finding it is not financially viable without the 20% reduction.  I know the Minister is open to this, and I will follow up on it with the NTA.  It is an area that needs a body of work from the Department, the Minister and the NTA.
