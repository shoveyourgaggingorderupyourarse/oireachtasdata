I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for taking this matter today.<\/p> <p>This important issue has been raised with me by several constituents.  From my discussions with them, it is evident that those who have suffered spinal injuries face ongoing medical challenges for a lifetime which come with a high cost.  Those medical challenges can include pain, urinary tract infections and pressure sores which need to be kept in check by doctors and nurses.  These can also present significant financial challenges.  Without a medical card to help offset significant medical costs, people with spinal injuries may not receive the vital care and attention they need.<\/p> <p>In the context of this discussion, it is clear many people with spinal injuries are caught between a rock and a hard place.  Currently, those who want to seek employment fear losing the medical card.  If they are not working, they face being caught in a poverty trap.  It is not just about the cost of living, keeping food on the table, a roof over their heads and paying the bills.  Associated health supports and services, essential to their everyday living, also need to be considered.  Without a medical card, there are many costs to be covered such as medicine, physiotherapy, wound dressing, regular visits to the GP and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, along with medical equipment such as wheelchairs, shower chairs and having this equipment serviced.  As one person with a spinal injury said to me, they are nervous about taking up employment because they fear losing the medical card.  This can be a great cause of stress.<\/p> <p>A spinal injury, unfortunately, is an injury for life, presenting ongoing challenges which I have outlined.  These concerns relating to employment and holding on to a medical card were highlighted in the 2017 Government report, Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities.  The report identified the main barriers which impede people with disabilities from fulfilling their employment ambitions.  Not surprisingly, the potential loss of a medical card was identified as the single most significant disincentive to taking up employment.  While people on a disability payment for at least a year can retain a medical card for a further three years when they return to work, the report confirmed that those with lifelong conditions generally do not see this temporary retention as sufficient in that it does not offer security of continued access to the medical card and the vital supports it brings.<\/p> <p>I strongly believe we must explore the possibility of reviewing the medical guidelines for people with spinal injuries.  These are people who want to work and to contribute economically.  However, the potential loss of the medical card creates a significant barrier for them to take up employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#B00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Feighan for raising this very important issue because the Government and I are very committed to ensuring that persons with a disability are supported in order for them to fulfil their employment ambitions and to address those barriers that might prevent them from doing so.  I visited the headquarters of Spinal Injuries Ireland two weeks ago on foot of an invite to open its new office and centre.  It is something of which I must be supportive.  The issue of medical cards arose with all the residents and patients there.  They were all very enthusiastic about getting into the workplace.  There were a lot of talented people in that room and it had a lasting impression on me.<\/p> <p>The Senator will be aware that an interdepartmental group was established under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities to address the issue of making work pay for such people.  The group's Make Work Pay report, which was published in April last year, found that the single most significant barrier to taking up employment or increasing the number of hours of employment for people with disabilities is the potential loss of the medical card.  Essentially, there is agreement on that particular issue.  To address this, the report contained two key recommendations relating to medical cards.  First, it recommended that the medical card earnings disregard be increased from its current level of &euro;120 for persons in receipt of disability allowance or partial capacity benefit. To that end, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have been examining proposals to give effect to this recommendation.  Officials are working to finalise the proposal and the Minister for Health expects to be announcing details of how this change will be implemented in the coming weeks.  The second recommendation regarding the medical card was to remove the requirement that work undertaken for the medical card earnings disregard must be of a rehabilitative nature.  I am happy to confirm that this measure was implemented by the HSE last year.<\/p> <p>Implementing both of the measures to which I refer will ensure that persons in receipt of disability allowance will now be in a position to have greater earnings capacity and can do so safe in the knowledge that their medical card, which enables them to access many vital health services, will be retained.  Support is also provided for persons who have been on a relevant welfare payment for a year and who then take up employment.  Such individuals can retain the medical card for an initial three-year period after taking up employment.  That is another important feature.  At the end of the period, cardholders will be assessed under the normal rules of the medical card scheme.  Should a person's income be above the relevant limit, he or she will be considered for a discretionary medical card, or a GP visit card, which takes account of the extra costs that arise from an illness or a disability.<\/p> <p>The Make Work Pay report contained a range of recommendations right across the span of Government, all of which are all intended to help those with disabilities to fulfil their employment ambitions.  Working together, we will ensure that persons with a disability are afforded every opportunity to maximise their employment potential, which will be beneficial for their own lives and society generally.  I feel very strongly about spinal injuries and I am completely in agreement with what the Senator said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#C00100","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his interest in this very sensitive, complex and difficult subject.

All of a sudden, these wonderful people who were active find themselves disabled.  That is the tough side.  It undoubtedly is a tough disability to have but the thing that blew me away that evening two weeks ago in D&uacute;n Laoghaire was their courage, positivity and determination to get back to work.  They wanted to contribute to society and some of them had very valuable skills.

I am sure that as Minister of State, he has visited many nursing homes.  As we know, they are fantastic institutions operated by dedicated individuals who selflessly work night and day to take care of our loved ones.  Nursing homes play a key role in healthcare delivery in Ireland.  It is never an easy decision for families or individuals to make to enter a nursing home.  I have heard many fabulous stories of fantastic care received in nursing homes but my issue concerns people who are placed in these settings for no reason other than there is nowhere else for them to go.  The case of Julia Thurmann was recently brought to my attention by Councillor Cormac Devlin.  Ms Thurmann was 34 when she found herself moving into a nursing home in 2008.  Ten years later, she is still there and her attempts to live independently have come up against repeated obstacles.  Ms Thurmann resides in a nursing home in north County Dublin with 120 other residents, some of whom are suffering from dementia.  While her placement in the nursing home costs the State more than &euro;62,000 per year, independent living would cost the State significantly less.  Her placement is inappropriate.  We are trying to get away from congregated settings to community settings and we need integration, not segregation.  I implore the Minister of State and the Government to redouble their efforts to support individuals with disabilities who are living in nursing homes, to bring to an end the congregated settings in which they are living at present and to afford them the opportunity to live in dignity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#D00300","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Swanick for raising this important issue.  I acknowledge, from working with him over the past two years, that he is very supportive of all people with disabilities, as well as of the rights of the person with a disability who is in a nursing home and who I firmly believe should not be there.  I will respond to that in detail.  It is important that we have this discussion because I wish to make clear that my position, and the Government's ongoing priority, is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing service and support for people with disabilities, which will empower them to live independent lives.  That is the plan and the vision.<\/p> <p>The health service provides specialist disability services to enable each individual with a disability to achieve his or her full potential to maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a wide variety of community residential services, in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory and non-statutory voluntary and community groups.  These services are provided within the available budget.  Although most families would prefer to be able to care for their loved ones at home, for various reasons hospital or nursing home care is at times necessary to meet their care needs and therefore forms part of their continued care.  In addressing the needs of adults with a disability, the full range of community services available are tailored to meet the needs of the individual.  The health service works with local authorities, Departments where applicable and other public services, as well as the voluntary sector, in seeking to tier the services to best fit the needs of the individual.  There are now fewer than 2,400 people living in a congregated setting and each year, more people are being supported to move into the community and independent living.  This year, we expect another 170 people to move on.  However, the Health Service Executive is aware that many people with disabilities reside in nursing homes.  We accept that point of Senator Swanick's argument.  In some cases, people may have enhanced support in respect of their disability support needs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The review of the nursing homes support scheme published in 2015 states that only 5% of long-term nursing home residents are aged under 65 years.  However, it is recognised there are a small number of younger people who require full-time nursing home care, such as those who have had a stroke or perhaps an acquired brain injury.  To establish which places are inappropriate and which are appropriate based on the primary needs of the individuals, an expert working group, led by the Disability Federation of Ireland, is currently carrying out a review of all those with disabilities aged less than 65 years of age that live in nursing homes.<\/p><p>The nursing home sector is used in developing options to meet the needs of some adults with a disability where no other alternatives are possible.  We need to regularly review these individuals to see if, through their care plan, a more appropriate option might be available.  In this particular case, it appears that one is.  In the longer term, the policy is to develop a more tailored service suitable to meet the needs of these service users.<\/p><p>In 2018, funding of some &euro;1.772 billion in total is being provided for health and personal social services for a wide and complex range of services and supports for those with disabilities, an increase of &euro;1.9 million on last year.  This year, through the HSE, we will provide over 8,300 residential places, as well as emergency supports for 385 persons.  We will provide over 82,000 respite nights and 42,500 day respite sessions to families in need right across the country.  I assure the House, as I have done on many occasions previously, that my ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable persons in the care of the health service.<\/p><p>As Senators will appreciate, I cannot comment specifically on an individual case.  However, I can confirm that my office has been in weekly contact with the person to whom Senator Swanick refers in his question in an effort to help secure more suitable accommodation from that which the person is currently in.  I can assure Senator Swanick and the House that we will continue to support the person concerned until such suitable accommodation is found.  In addition, I am informed that the HSE has been engaging with the person concerned and the family, and will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#D00400","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response.

I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  People have raised concerns with me about possible changes to the designation of raised and blanket bogs, or the extension of designation under the habitats directive, which previously resulted in a debacle around turf cutters and their rights.  It is not an issue which ran smoothly although ultimately it was resolved.<\/p> <p>The designation of lands under the habitats directive involved the National Parks and Wildlife Service drawing up a map and a list of our best examples of natural heritage and presenting it to Europe.  That happened at least 20 years ago and there was no real debate on the matter.  It was in the realm of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, its scientists and so on.  There was no engagement with the public and politicians did not grasp the nettle.  I compare it with similar obligations placed on the Northern Ireland Executive which also had to ask people to stop cutting turf on their bogs.  However, there was none of this carry on because from the outset, the executive had taken steps to address the issue.  I ask that if there is anything coming down the line on this matter, the Minister would set it out here today.  I am concerned that there should be proper public engagement while the scientists do their work.  There are reasons why there is designation and benefits from it and there are ways in which we can mitigate the impact on humans.  However, if there is no dialogue, the same thing will happen again regarding our bogs and the objections of turf cutters.  <\/p> <p>In a similar vein, under the habitats directive, most of the western seaboard is designated a special area of conservation or some other environmental designation.  In County Mayo, 50% of our land is designated.  I believe the chickens are coming home to roost; every time there is a twist or turn or an attempt to develop infrastructure or housing, we are met with the habitats directive.  For example, phase 2 of the N26, from Ballina to Bohola, a much-needed primary road, was refused because it was overdesigned and because of Whooper swans.  There is an ongoing situation around the replacement of a much-needed new bridge at Cloongullane outside Swinford which is also part of the N26.  Once again, an issue has been raised under the habitats directive on account of the presence of alluvial woodland.<\/p> <p>When we try to clean out streams and rivers we have issues with pearl mussels.  The list goes on.  I believe we have to make our peace with our environment because we require it to live, prosper and thrive, which is why we equally must tackle climate change, but there must be a balance between humans and our natural environment.  The way things are drafted and the way in which the habitats directive operates, it seems that in a special area of conservation, humans can never win and the environment has priority.  I believe there is a means by which this can be overcome and there can be a plan for co-existence, namely, management plans under the habitats directive.  I understand that we do not have any in Ireland but it is how other member states operate their habitats.  It is high time we did this.  We cannot keep running into brick walls with An Bord Plean&aacute;la telling us that we cannot develop into the west, especially with Project Ireland 2040 and ambitious plans for the western seaboard which could come a cropper unless this very critical and overarching issue is addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#F00200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mulherin for raising this issue.

The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, published in December 2017, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored, and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed, including exploring the options in terms of certain provisions of Article 6 of the habitats directive.<\/p><p>As stated in this plan, in order to compensate for permanent losses of active raised bog from the special area of conservation network, it is proposed to designate two new special areas of conservation.

This will entail: the retention of 36 existing natural heritage areas including seven sites to be divided; the designation of 46 natural heritage areas, including the relevant areas of the seven sites to be divided; and the designation as natural heritage areas of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs that are in public ownership or in respect of which there is reduced turf-cutting pressure, so as to compensate for the loss of habitat within the sites where it is provided that turf cutting may continue.<\/p><p>Arising from this review, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is currently proceeding through the necessary Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 review.<\/p><p>I do not propose to identify the 25 sites until I am in a position to apply the relevant legal protections to them.  Compensation will be available to affected turf cutters from these sites.  A total of 50 sites have been selected as blanket bog special areas of conservation.  A further 73 sites have been designated as natural heritage areas for blanket bog protection.  The national peatlands strategy states that, under the habitats directive, Ireland is obliged to devise and implement a system of management that will ensure that turf cutting on blanket bog special areas of conservation continues in such a way that will not threaten the integrity of these sites.  Any system of management for blanket bog sites must be drawn up in consultation with local communities to ensure that these important peatlands are managed in a sustainable way for the benefit of the community and in compliance with EU law.<\/p><p>Consideration is being given within my Department to how best a system of management for domestic turf cutting on blanket bog sites might be introduced.  I want to ensure that appropriate consultation takes place with local communities, following which the necessary scientific work can be carried out to underpin sustainable management of these sites in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#F00300","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>We are already well over the limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#G00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I am concerned that the Minister's public consultation seems to be taking place after she has already decided upon two new SACs and 25 natural heritage areas.

On 27 March, the Government took the decision to expel a Russian diplomat in what could only be described as an act of sycophantic fawning over its British counterpart.  The Government asked us to trust British intelligence, the very same intelligence agencies that provided us with false information regarding Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the same service that refuses to this day to release information on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Three days after the Government took that decision, 750 innocent Palestinian protesters were wounded by Israeli soldiers at a peaceful planned march in Gaza and 15 civilians were murdered that day.  Over the two weeks which followed, the death toll reached 31 civilians, with more than 1,000 injured.  Not one Israeli diplomat has been expelled.  This was a predetermined, careful attack, which included sniper gunfire, drones, artillery and tear gas attacks on peaceful protesters.  One of those innocent Palestinians was a journalist and since his murder, a video has been leaked to the press revealing Israeli soldiers cheering and celebrating as they used Palestinian protesters as sniper practice.  Has the Minister seen the video?  It is truly grotesque.<\/p> <p>On 28 March I received a letter which highlighted the regular arrest and detention of Palestinian political representatives, concentrating lately on the Palestinian Legislative Council, PLC.  Right now, 12 members of the PLC are being held in Israeli prisons, nine under internment without trial.  Not content with arresting Palestinian parliamentarians, the Israeli Government also wanted to prevent the Lord Mayor of Dublin from entering occupied Palestine.  Did the Minister consider summoning the Israeli ambassador to explain the hostility to the elected Lord Mayor?  As he knows, Israel operates an apartheid state in occupied Palestine, where it is illegal for Palestinians to be a member of any political party.  It is fine for Israeli citizens to be members of political parties and they have access to civilian courts but this is illegal for Palestinians, who are dealt with by military courts.

With regard to the issue of substance the Senator has raised, I made two statements on behalf of the Government, on 31 March and on 9 April, on the recent violence on the Israel-Gaza border.  I called on all parties to show restraint, in particular on the use of force by Israel against demonstrators.  Any country is entitled to defend its borders, but use of force must be proportionate to any immediate threat.  The number of people injured by live ammunition has been very troubling, and I support the calls by the EU and the UN Secretary General for an independent and transparent investigation into these events.<\/p> <p>Events and images such as we have seen in recent weeks from Gaza are of great concern to many people, including myself, and I understand that there are very strong feelings that something must be done.  I agree with those feelings.  The situation in Gaza is unsustainable.  I was there a couple of months ago, and I have been to Gaza on more than one occasion.  I know the tension on the Israeli-Gaza border.  I have witnessed it and spoken to people on that border.  The issue here is how do we change all of this.  How does Ireland influence and understand the perspective of Palestinians and Israelis with a view to trying to see a political solution which, ultimately, is the only way in which Palestinians living in Gaza will find some hope for the future and will allow them to turn away from demonstration, violence, frustration and tension because of the circumstances they find themselves in and the conditions in which they are currently living within Gaza, which are totally unacceptable?<\/p> <p>Every time I go to Gaza and meet people, or meet people from there, they are educated people who understand exactly what is going on in the world.  As a result of this, the depth of their frustration in terms of the restrictions they live under in Gaza is unbearable.  That being said, what we need to focus on as politicians and as governments is to look at ways in which we can change that.  Rather than simply gestures and actions of protest, we should be finding a way to ensure we contribute to political dialogue that brings about change.  That is what I am about.  The idea that by expelling an Israeli ambassador and, therefore, shutting an Israeli embassy in Dublin actually helps the efforts to find political solutions to problems that have been going on for decades simply does not stack up in my view.  In diplomatic language, expelling an ambassador essentially means one is no longer interested in dialogue, and certainly that is not the approach of this Government and it is not my approach either.  With respect, in my view, to take that approach would do nothing except offer a gesture of solidarity to Palestinians in the short term, but then we would be unable to help them in the medium term, which is what I would like to do, in our quest for a two-state solution that is fair to both Israelis and Palestinians.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I intend to continue to talk to the Israeli Government and to the Israeli ambassador in Dublin, as I have done, on these issues and to the Palestinian ambassador here.

The problems in the Defences Forces must be addressed and must be addressed now.  This is a national crisis.  My colleague mentioned the Border a few moments ago.  We have no idea what is really going to happen with the Border but if it requires patrolling and manning, we will need the Defence Forces.  We do not want to get caught like we were in 1969, without troops on the ground.  <\/p><p>This is a serious crisis affecting the State.  It is time we had the Taoiseach in here to discuss it, because he is the de facto Minister for Defence.  I will not put pressure on the Leader today to get the Taoiseach to appear but I will put pressure on him by the end of the week and I will seek the support of the entire House to have him called before it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#O00700","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>On the edition of \"Prime Time\" broadcast on 10 April, a story was told about a young boy named Adam King, who is less than four years of age.  His mother outlined his wheelchair needs.  He is one of 53 children and 207 adults in this position in the Cork-Kerry region alone but I revert to the story about Adam because what appals me and is really serious is that at the end of that programme, the HSE was able to confirm that his wheelchair needs had been met, yet they had not been met in the previous month or six months or whenever.  This is a child younger than four, who we were told also had the potential for scoliosis.<\/p> <p>In recent weeks, when Ms Vera Twomey was again in the media talking about the cost of treatment for her daughter, we miraculously were told that the health services could pay it.  Must every mother and person with a disability prostrate themselves in front of our national media to get something sorted out?  This is an issue for our public bodies, the HSE and the Department, as well as for Members.  They come up with answers when they are put to the pin of their collars and embarrassed publically.  That is no way for any state to run public services.  While we cannot magic money out of the air, a child of three or four - who thankfully has the possibility of going on to get a decent education - does not have the equivalent of a pair of shoes that fit.  That was an issue for a lot of people who went to school in their bare feet 60 or 70 years ago.  We are not able to deliver that.<\/p> <p>I will conclude by noting that two days from now, 19 April, will be the 30th day since the T&aacute;naiste lodged the papers for the commencement of Ireland's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  These are the issues that must be acted on fairly rapidly and now is the time.  I have written to the Taoiseach on this, and in this House and elsewhere I have commended him on catching that issue by the scruff of the neck and getting it ratified after 11 years.  Together with all his Cabinet, he must now publically state this is a big-ticket item in Ireland and we are four-square behind it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is the challenge for the Government.

I also thank the other colleagues who dropped in to observe D&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht na n&Oacute;g, whereby 16 transition year students from all across the island, North and South, took part in a public speaking competition as part of the celebration of the centenary of women's suffrage in Ireland.  The 15 year olds and 16 year olds who spoke today showed us a thing or two about how to construct an excellent speech and how to speak in a compelling way, with passion and rational argument, and in a well-informed and articulate manner.  I congratulate all those involved and the Oireachtas staff who also made it such a success.<\/p> <p>Since we were last in this Chamber, there have been dreadful developments in Syria, with a chemical attack perpetrated by the Syrian Government on its own people.  I ask the Leader if we can make another attempt at constructing a cross-party motion.  It is unfortunate that we could not do it on the previous occasion but the need for concerted action to seek a resolution to the horrific ongoing conflict is even more pressing.  I commend the Irish Government, the response of which - both to the chemical attacks leading to the appalling deaths of civilians and to the attacks by the US, France and the UK - has been measured.  It has expressed understanding of, rather than given support to, the counter-action led by the US and there has been an emphasis on urging all sides to get back to the negotiating table, particularly next week when the EU-UN conference on Syria will take place in Brussels.  We need to support the Government and recognise that, while all of us would wish to see multilateral UN-sanctioned action against the Syrian Government, Russia has vetoed 12 UN motions on Syria in recent years.  That is a major reason the conflict has continued for so long.<\/p> <p>I request a debate on press freedom in light of the ongoing action in the High Court, particularly the application by the ODCE which has now been adjourned.  It raises serious concerns about alleged data breaches in respect of journalists and about the need to ensure that journalists have the right to protect their sources because, in a democracy, freedom of the press is a vitally important principle.  We should all be concerned at any attempt to erode that.<\/p> <p>Does the Leader know when it is proposed to conclude the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the D&aacute;il?  We have concluded it in the Seanad.  A report published by Trinity College academics, Professor Joe Barry and Dr. Ann Hope, put the impact of serious and heavy drinking on others at some &euro;873 million per year.  The clearly articulated findings, about the substantial impact heavy drinking has on the family and friends of drinkers, are groundbreaking.  This is like the reports we saw on the environmental impact of tobacco and cigarette smoking on others in the vicinity of smokers, as well as the health impact to the smoker, and it deserves to read by all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#Q00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>The last item is a matter for the D&aacute;il and I am not sure the Leader is equipped to answer it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#Q00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I pass on the condolences of the Sinn F&eacute;in team in the Seanad to the family of Big Tom and I acknowledge all the years of entertainment he provided for his fans, not only in this country but also on the international stage.

Anyone who missed it should tune in to look at the substance that was there.  It is something which is often absent from debates not only in the Chambers in the Oireachtas but in chambers across the world.  I acknowledge the work of our chairperson, Senator Bacik, and my fellow committee members in that regard.

I raise the matter here because I tried to table a Commencement matter on route No. 52, which is the bus route connecting Ballina in north Mayo to Galway, particularly to University Hospital Galway.  A review is currently taking place, in which regard I raise the issue of the lack of consultation with people in the area who use the route and with those who use regional routes in general.  I want the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the Chamber to have a proper discussion on connectivity and accountability regarding services and, indeed, his own accountability.  It is not good enough to get a letter which says the Minister has no official responsibility.  If he is Minister for transport, it is his responsibility and he needs to make sure he meets it.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter further in circumstances where this route in particular is a vital link between north Mayo and University Hospital Galway.  Those people who do not have access to other forms of public or private transport need the route to be left in place.  It is a viable service and the Minister must look at it again in the context of rural transport.  People in rural Ireland deserve a public transport system and the Minister must acknowledge that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#R00100","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I rise today to speak of one matter alone.

All of the things that have been said about his benign nature, his goodness of personality, the way in which he reached out to people, his ordinariness and lack of nonsense are true.  I can testify to that having met him on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>He was the voice of, and a voice for, a generation and a very important one in those times.  He brought a great deal of joy to people.  We all have a tendency to romanticise the past and to look back at it as a wonderful time, but the period during which Big Tom was huge throughout the 1960s and 1970s was difficult for people in terms of income, social infrastructure and entertainment.  Big Tom's performances and dances around the country were a source of great joy and brought people together in big numbers.  They relieved what could be the tedium and difficulties of life.  His appearances were accessible to ordinary people because of the price and the huge numbers attending.<\/p> <p>Big Tom was not merely a huge source of joy to many, he was also an extraordinary link with our emigrants.  He was the one great link in particular for the cohort who went out in the 1950s and 1960s to the well-known Irish places in England and around the globe.

Today, the 2017 Women's Aid impact report was released, revealing over 19,000 disclosures of domestic abuse against women and children were made to the organisation last year.  These figures take into account emotional abuse, as well as actual violence.  The report revealed 15,833 disclosures of domestic violence against women and 3,552 disclosures of child abuse in the context of domestic violence.  In the report, the numbers tell a story.  Up to 21,451 contacts were made to Women's Aid services in 2017, of which around 10,000 related to emotional abuse, such as verbal abuse, or violence.  Around 1,500 reports were of a financial nature where free access to money was denied or controlled.<\/p> <p>These numbers are about real women who have nowhere to turn.  I meet many of these women in my clinics and I am sometimes shocked by how little I can do.  I try my best to access some help for them because they need support.  The report looks at these numbers and highlights how separation does not always mean safety.  Up to 28% of women which the organisation worked with in 2017 were enduring abusive treatment from a former partner.  There is currently no law against contacting a former partner, even if the partner does not want that contact.  Leaving a bad relationship is often not the end of that relationship.  If children are involved, it becomes even more complicated.<\/p> <p>We fail to protect women in this country.  That is a fact.  We leave them alone with our fingers crossed that they may get in touch with a service which may help them.  Often that service cannot give them what they need, namely, a safe harbour or a place to be free.  We urgently need to look at how we can help women in bad situations to get out and to be free before it turns more sinister.

I understand the reasons behind it because of the nature of the housing crisis but we need to discuss the implications the strategic housing development process is having on zoning across Dublin city and wider afield.  It is effectively open season for development on Z15 lands, in particular, institutional lands and schools.  In many communities, that might be a positive but in others it is not.  The protection of Z15 must be considered by the Government because An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not taking it into account.<\/p><p>Lastly, I need to talk about the Shanowen shakedown protest that took place outside Leinster House this afternoon.  I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, went out and spoke to the students, which is to her credit.  However, the rising rent costs for students in this city and across the country is troubling and the students have recommended that an amendment be made to legislation to facilitate a rent cap for students.  Rent increases of that nature are detrimental to their capacity to have a student life and proceed with their studies.  In fairness, the Minister of State did come out and talk to them.  I would like an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#U00500","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I, too, support the call of my colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh, to bring the Minister, Deputy Ross, into the House to talk about connectivity in public transport, especially in rural areas.<\/p> <p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 63, motion 12, on the Seanad Order Paper be taken before No. 1.  My bias is known.  As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, I am a general practitioner, GP, by profession.  The cuts sustained by general practice during the austerity years in Ireland were among the highest sustained by any group of workers in the State - more than 35% before tax - without taking into consideration the cost of running practices.  At the recent National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, annual general meeting, together with the platitudes offered by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, he stated that FEMPI would be reversed but that it would be linked to service improvements across general practice.  Along with the debilitating cuts, GPs have seen an increase in workload and a decrease in the number of their colleagues.  With over 600 GPs over the age of 60 and more than 10% of Ireland's 2,440 GPs who are involved in the GMS scheme due to retire from that scheme in the next 24 months, it is hard to see how or where these service improvements can be made.  I propose this motion to call on the Government to expedite the negotiations on a new GP contract and to accelerate the FEMPI cut reversals and restore the viability of general practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#V00200","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Tom McBride.

The then Chinese ambassador, Mr. Luo Linquan, was adamant that this would be a delegation of the Chairs of both Houses and the Chairs of the joint committees.

It was unbelievable to think that a delegation from Ireland could meet five of the ruling standing committee.  Our agenda included opening up of the beef trade and allowing horses to be exported directly from Ireland to China, because at that time horses had to be quarantined in Europe before they could go on to China.  That ban was lifted and now horses can go straight from Ireland to China and the beef trade deal has been agreed.  Sometimes when credit is being given, the power of the Oireachtas itself can be underestimated.  I have no doubt that the Houses of the Oireachtas played a huge role in opening doors on that occasion and probably on several other occasions too.  I want to put that on record that sometimes we underestimate the power of the Oireachtas.  It was a high-powered delegation, with the Chairs of both Houses and the Chairs of the joint committees who met the president in China, and it was well received.  I thank the Chinese ambassador to Ireland at the time, H.E. Luo Linquan, and our ambassador, Mr. Declan Kelleher, who played a huge role at the time.

There is a complex in south county Dublin which is owned by one of the biggest multinational IT companies in the world and it was opened by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  It is wonderful to have inward investment, something with which I agree.  This building is purpose built, with the capacity to hold a workforce of 3,000.  According to its website, the complex is twice the size of Croke Park and is the height of three double decker buses.  This company has never paid a single penny in commercial rates to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown council.  I am not blaming the company or the council.  The council knows the square footage of this building since it granted planning permission for it and oversaw the planning regulations in relation to its construction.  The problem is that the Valuation Office tells us that there are thousands of properties which need to be valued and it does not have enough resources, support or valuers to carry them out.  It is estimated that the local authority is losing &euro;1 million annually.  One cannot charge rates until a property is occupied.  The property in question has been occupied for nine months at most.  The Taoiseach opened it officially in February but it was operational last year.  Local authorities rely on commercial rates, local property tax and central intervention to fund the core activities of local government.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, has responsibility for this area and I have spoken to him about a general review of new rates.  We need to take a whole new look at how we rate commercial properties, how we apply rates and how we can bring in different bands.  It is an archaic system.  I am not talking about scrapping it but about reforming it.  There had been a suggestion from Government that we would have a new rates Bill but when one of the biggest companies in the world is not paying rates here not due to any fault of its own, but because the Valuation Office says it cannot prioritise properties, it is a very serious issue.  I ask the Leader to speak to the Minister of State and ascertain what is happening regarding a new rates Bill.<\/p> <p>I congratulate everyone who organised the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 contributions in the House earlier today.  I came in to listen to some of it, and I congratulate all the young people who spoke.  They all spoke exceptionally well.

We sometimes do not recognise the significance of the Good Friday Agreement on the island of Ireland or, indeed, on the two islands.  Most people spoke but two certainly captured the imagination.  The first was George Mitchell, who said the real heroes of the Good Friday Agreement were the people of Northern Ireland and the political leaders.  We need those political leaders today more than ever.  The second speaker who captured the imagination was Seamus Mallon.  It really resonated with those in the hall when he said that nationalists must be able to persuade unionists that Irish unity is a good thing and that they should not fear constitutional change.  He said that unionists are afraid and need space to breathe.  He said it is the wrong time to call for a Border poll.  He said unionists need to &ldquo;feel part of this island, part of the land which they farm, part of the country they belong to.  I don&rsquo;t care what they call it, as long as it has one name: home.\"  That is something we need to consistently say.  If we want unity, one Ireland or an Ireland together, the people should be comfortable that it is known as home - not a united Ireland, not Ireland, but home.

He brought Ireland to the dance halls of the United Kingdom and to the emigrants who had to leave our shores,.

This has been the Government's view.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, will be here to debate the Good Friday Agreement and the North.  Senator Richmond has resumed work on the Brexit committee.  In the coming weeks, it is the intention to have a debate on Brexit in the House, in tandem with the Brexit committee, and I will be happy to have this as part of the work schedule.

I certainly join the Senator in congratulating him.  He is editor of <i>The Storm Lake Times<\/i>in Storm Lake, Iowa.  It is always important that we commend, support and salute the type of tenacious writing and reporting and the impressive independence that allows journalists to challenge and question those of us in the political class and that allows people to be curious.

Recruitment is ongoing and discussions and negotiations are under way as we speak.  I believe it would be a wrong move to have An Taoiseach come into the House for a debate on the Defence Forces.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, is the line Minister for the Defence Forces and I am happy to ask him to return to the House for that debate.  I am happy to discuss the matter further with Senator Craughwell following the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of Adam King, in respect of which I do not have information to hand.  I agree with the Senator that it should not take a television or radio programme or an article in a newspaper for a person to get that to which he or she is entitled.  If that is what happened in this case, that is unacceptable.  We employ people in the HSE whose job it is to deliver services, provide equipment and manage facilities.  I am happy to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House for a debate on the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan is correct that provision of services and facilities for people with disabilities is at the core of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This is about people, men, women and children, who deserve to be treated with respect and in a dignified manner.  I make no apology for saying that.  The Senator will be aware of my involvement in terms of disability issues.  The Senator is correct that it is not good enough that the HSE would only respond when a matter is highlighted on a television programme.  We need proper planning on behalf of people.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of Syria.  I thought we agreed a cross-party motion on the last occasion we discussed the issue.  I join with Senator Bacik in condemning the attack in Syria last weekend.  Ongoing counter military action is not the way forward.  We need to bring about a resolution through the United Nations.  I am of the view that the United Nations, in not doing its business, is failing the people of Syria.  Senator Bacik is correct that the Russians have vetoed 12 UN motions on Syria.  This is not only about the United Nations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am on the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly, OSCE PA, and the Russians there are equally obdurate.  However, I believe a concerted effort must be made to ensure that we end the slaughter and killing in Syria and the awful treatment of the people by their own.  I commend the Senator on that.<br\/><br\/>Senators Bacik and Coghlan raised the freedom of the press and the ongoing issues around INM.  All democrats recognise the importance of media and respect their independence and the need for a free and democratic press.  Senator Coghlan spoke about media ownership.  I believe his remarks are right.  If we are going to have a small number of owners and a monopoly situation, that would be contrary to the common good.  I agree with Senator Coghlan.  In the D&aacute;il this afternoon the Taoiseach said he would look at other reports on media freedom and that he would consider legislation, if required, to protect journalists' sources.  All of us agree that we must have an independent, free press and strong, independent media.  Any alleged breach of personal data is worrying and wrong and we should utterly condemn it.  I realise the matter is before the courts as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has made an application to the High Court, but all of us agree on the need for strong, independent media.<br\/><br\/>Senators Black and Bacik raised the report on alcohol published by the HSE and Trinity College and commended the three authors of the report.  It highlights what we on the Oireachtas joint committee began, which led to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill being passed by this House.  That Bill is on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and is navigating its way through that House.  The report highlights that we, as a people and a society, must have a serious conversation about our relationship with alcohol, how we misuse alcohol and the impact it has on people's lives, their work output in the context of the loss of hours and public health in terms of bed nights in hospitals.  It is something we will have to return to again on a number of occasions.<br\/><br\/>Senators Conway-Walsh and Swanick raised transport and bus route No. 52 from Ballina to Galway.  I am not familiar with the issue they raised.  I am of the view that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should not be <i>au fait<\/i>with all transport routes and links in the country, but it is a matter for the Department.  The Senators said it was TII or the NTA that has overall responsibility, but I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss transport matters.  I believe that, in general, there must be more accountability on the part of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA regarding the provision of bus service routes and bus shelters across the country.  There is no accountability.  Equally, in health matters, the HSE must step up and be held to account for the management of the resources it has been given.  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Ross, he is not responsible for the planning of bus routes but I will endeavour to bring him to the House to discuss transport.<br\/><br\/>Senators Murnane O'Connor and Devine raised the publication today of the Women's Aid report.  The figures in that report are very worrying.  I commend Women's Aid on its invaluable work.  The Government is committed to supporting the victims of domestic violence.  When we previously discussed the Domestic Violence Bill all of us spoke about the need to end the menace of domestic violence.  The programme for Government is committed to the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is important to add the latter as well.  The ratification of the Istanbul Convention is part of that.  The Domestic Violence Bill that was passed by this House is also navigating its way through the D&aacute;il and is on Report Stage.  I hope it will be passed because it is important that we send a strong message to society in general regarding the issues raised by Senators Murnane O'Connor and Devine.  It is also about raising awareness and I hope we can have a debate in the House on the report in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised Brexit and the issue of aviation policy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss this important matter, particularly aviation safety after Brexit.<\/p><p>Senator Ray Butler raised the issue of local authorities using private traffic warden services, specifically in Navan.  As I am not familiar with the issue, perhaps he will submit it as a Commencement matter. <\/p><p>Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Senator Swanick.  It is not that I disagree with the sentiment the Senator expresses but rather that talks on a new contract for general practitioners, including remuneration, are about to begin between the medical organisations, the Department and the Health Service Executive.  I agree that progress must be made in this matter.  Rather than divide the House, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.  I will ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on this important matter.  I appreciate the work being done by general practitioners in the primary care setting, which is of great importance in the future health landscape as we enter the era of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I will be pleased to hold a debate on the matter at a later stage. <\/p><p>I compliment Senator Swanick and Senator Conway-Walsh on accepting, on behalf of the people of Erris, an award at the People of the Year Awards.  Senator Hopkins also attended the event with members of her local community.  The attendance of Senators showed that politicians are members of the community and are not aloof and isolated.  Comhghairdeas le na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.<\/p><p>Senator Richmond referred to the 14 new schools announced last week.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, is committed to coming to the House in the weeks ahead to discuss the Action Plan for Education.  I will be glad to have the matter raised by the Senator discussed in that debate.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also raised the issue of education.  I am not familiar with the important issue he raised regarding a school for Travellers.  Perhaps he will consider submitting a Commencement matter on the issue.  Regarding housing and land zoning, it is important to strike the right balance between our desire for more housing and the need to keep open spaces open to the public for recreational and leisure use.  I agree with the Senator on this point.  I also welcome today's meeting between the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills and students to discuss the need for a cap on rents for student accommodation.<\/p><p>To respond to Senator Paddy Burke, I congratulate and pay tribute to all of those involved in the opening of the Chinese market to Irish beef.  The Senator correctly noted his role in this matter and the role played by others, including the former Ceann Comhairle, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his officials on the work they did to deliver access to this significant market for Irish farmers.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Boyhan on the need for a complete reform of the rates system.  While the system cannot be abolished for obvious reasons, I agree it is archaic and needs to reviewed, not least the matter of the role of the Valuation Office in determining the moneys being paid by a sizeable company.  I will ask the Minister to come to the House to debate the issue. <\/p><p>On Senator Feighan's comments on the Good Friday Agreement, he can raise these matters in tomorrow's debate with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney. <\/p><p>If Senator Swanick agrees to withdraw his motion, I will have the Minister come to the House for a debate in the coming weeks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#AA02500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Senator Swanick has moved an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 63, motion 12, be taken before No. 1.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#CC00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>In light of the Leader's response, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.

This was not the experience of the public or anyone outside the Fine Gael Party when it came to the national planning framework.  I am proposing an amendment today that seeks to strengthen the Bill.  It will ensure that never again can a Government set up a stall in rural Ireland and launch a document advertising its wares without proper discussion in this Parliament.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposes this amendment so that no matter what national planning framework ever again comes to this Parliament, it cannot go through without a vote in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad.  I will be looking for the Minister of State's support in this.  There was a lot of disappointment over what happened with the national planning framework.  Many people I spoke to were very disappointed.  This national planning framework has a massive impact on people's lives, whether it is through quality of life, job creation or transport.  This is about people's lives and it is important that nothing else can happen again unless it is voted through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#DD00600","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I want to speak in support of the amendment but I want to hear what the Minister of State has to say first.  There was an expectation that the Houses of the Oireachtas would approve the national planning framework.  I want to say from the outset that I am supportive of the framework in total.  It is an amazing and positive document.  I have attended two conferences where I have seen the Minister of State's officials, whom I compliment, give presentations on this to local elected members.  They had a really good engagement and conversation.  They were the two most important sessions at these councillors' conferences that I have attended in the past few years.  It is important to acknowledge the work of the Minister of State's officials.  I want that to go back to them.  They are on top of it and fully understand it.<\/p> <p>This is a plan, like Rebuilding Ireland.  It is a good thing for people to commit to a plan and set down objectives.  We all want prosperity and for our country to be developed and planned in a proper and sustainable way.  We all want to bring the economic benefits across the island of Ireland.  It is a good document.  In the absence of anything else, it is exceptionally good.  However, I do think there was a genuine expectation.  It might be helpful if the Minister of State could share with us whether he has seen the legal advice provided to the joint Oireachtas committee.  He may be aware of it and may or may not have seen it.  He might comment on it if he wishes.  I think it is appropriate to comment.  He might also state whether the Department and Government sought advice on it.  They had a very impressive launch down in Sligo and I know they were keen to get on with it.  The Minister of State is also keen to get on with this legislation.  I do not think there is any point in revisiting history but there are lessons to be learned on all sides about how this expectation came about and why it did not happen.  The Minister of State might share with us his knowledge on these question if that is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#EE00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I think we had a lengthy discussion on this amendment previously but I will do a little bit of recapping.  I accept what Senator Boyhan has said.  Some genuinely had an expectation that there would be a vote on this.  We were very clear, certainly in the discussion in the D&aacute;il when this was referred to committee.  What the committee was doing on behalf of both Houses of the Oireachtas was bringing forward the submission and suggestions for the Government to act on, which we did.  We were very clear in the D&aacute;il at that stage, last October, about the process.  That was the time for the Oireachtas to have its say on that, on behalf of both Houses, and we were quite clear on it.  I do accept that some genuinely had expectations.  However, others did not but have wanted to approach things differently in the more recent couple of months.  I am disappointed in that.  I accept people who are genuine and genuinely thought this.  Others are just using the system for a different debate, which I am disappointed with because this is a very serious decision on behalf of the country.  It is planning up to 2040.<\/p> <p>To Senator Murnane O'Connor, I have to say that having spent the last two years working with the guys in the Department who are working on this probably for the last three or four years, we all take this job very seriously.  That is why we are looking to 2040.  We understand it is about people's lives and understand the seriousness behind it.  We have taken our job very seriously here.  We have gone out of our way to make sure every Department and agency, any community and anybody who wants to be involved in this has been involved in it.  Their thoughts and concerns, I would say, have been quite well represented with all the different changes.  We went to the regional meetings and local authority meetings.  I do believe there has been a lot of consultation.  We do accept and believe how important this is to people's lives.  While we might not agree with the Senators' amendments and the process they want - there is a reason for that which I will go through - we do recognise how serious it is.  A lot of work was put into this plan by many people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This has not happened in the past for whatever reason.  It involved every Department and Government agency to bring everybody on board.  We are trying to ensure real genuine long-term planning for this country which was not been done in the past.  I am disappointed the Senators do not necessarily recognise that but I understand that for different reasons, different things have happened.<\/p><p>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 34 and 35 relating to the adoption of the national planning framework as tabled by the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators and Senator Murnane O'Connor, respectively.  The objectives of the national planning framework are fundamental to the achievement of long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability.  A more balanced distribution of population and employment growth is considered essential to safeguarding the economy's growth and potential, as well as pre-empting the risk that economic growth would be seriously constrained by congestion costs.  Through the national planning framework and as part of the ten-year capital investment plan, it is intended that the different regions' capabilities and strengths will be boosted to manage future population and economic growth over the next 20 years, catering for an extra 1 million people, and an additional 650,000 jobs and 500,000 more homes.<\/p><p>Following its publication, we need to get on with implementing the framework and translate the broad principles into regional and local actions, supported by co-ordinated and prioritised investment at central and local levels.  A formal vote on the final planning framework was never envisaged under this legislation.  I accept some Senators genuinely thought it was.  It was intended all parties would have a formal opportunity to discuss and have an input into the drafting process.  This has been facilitated through a motion approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas last autumn, referring the draft national planning framework, published last November, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for its consideration and to submit a report to the Minister.  The committee met and sent a formal submission on behalf of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I assume every Senator had an opportunity to feed into that.  As a Minister of State, I attended that committee, as well as the rural affairs committee, on this draft.  The intention of the process was always clear.  This was accepted and it went through without being opposed in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The Bill has two key provisions in this regard relating to submitting the draft framework for the approval of both Houses before it is published and the Government having regard to any resolution or a report from the Oireachtas in finalising the framework.  We have been faithful to both of those commitments in the Bill despite the fact that, as yet, it has no legal standing.  We have carefully listened to and taken on board many of the issues raised on all sides of the Houses.  Having devoted a significant amount of effort to managing and integrating views from across all parties into the final document, there is an urgent need to finalise and adopt this framework and its complementary ten-year capital plan.  This will mean strategic planning and infrastructure investment can be undertaken to meet the pressing needs of our growing and resurgent economy, as well as wider society.  To further delay this extensive process for political debate would deny citizens the implementation of the plan they need.  In addition, there will be further opportunities to elaborate on the national planning framework at regional and local levels through the subsequent regional spatial and economic strategies, the preparation of which has been going on in each of the different regions and which will be completed by the end of 2018 and, ultimately, in city and county and development plans.<\/p><p>If one engages with local authorities, they want this process under way.  Local authorities are due to complete their development plans.  It is best that all of those plans will be aligned to the regional strategy and the national plan.  They want clarity around this and have asked us to get on with it.  It is a pity the legislation got delayed in this House.  It started nearly two years ago and it is still not finished.  It would be wrong to delay planning for our country for another couple of months.  It was hoped the national planning framework would be in place at the back end of last year but we are seven months behind.  I would be disappointed if votes were used in this House which will not achieve what they hope and will just delay the planning framework.  I am not sure what the motives involved are when I consider the consultation we already have had.  I am not sure the people the Senators represent would be grateful for this.<\/p><p>The amendment proposes that the national planning framework can only be placed on a statutory footing once the Government submits the document, together with the environmental report and the appropriate assessment report for the amendment and approval by each House of the Oireachtas.  If the intention of the proposed amendment is about putting the document published by the Government on 16 February last on a statutory footing, then it is unnecessary.  This is because, having regard to the provisions of section 2 of the Act, there is an existing mechanism for legally recognising the status of the national planning framework.  My Department has already written to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la advising them of this fact.  If the national spatial strategy was mentioned in the end, the meaning of section 2 is such that those references have now been replaced by the national planning framework.  The Act refers to the spatial strategy of 2002 or any replacement documents.  The national planning framework is the new spatial strategy.  It assumes that position and is on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>More generally, it is regrettable that Sinn F&eacute;in put down this amendment to draw back the document published by the Government on 16 February last and which has been subject to extensive public consultation for a retrospective vote and presumably alteration.  As parliamentarians, we need to think about such a move carefully.  If the amendment were passed and the rug was pulled from under the national planning framework, what do we say to the thousands of people who have already made submissions and are satisfied the Government has listened to finalise the document on a fair and balanced basis?  Most people accept it and the follow-on regional plans were fair and balanced.  There is a great danger the amendment would be seen as an attempt to subjugate the consultation process already undertaken in good faith and before legislation is processed simply for political purposes without considering the practical effects such a vote would have, notwithstanding the fact that the document has to be finalised long before this Bill will have legal effect.<\/p><p>We need to think carefully about the full legal and practical effect of this amendment in terms of the EU environmental law requirements it will bring down on all our heads.  Further legal advice is required from the Attorney General's office but it would appear that the amendment would have the effect of making D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the competent authority for the purposes of considering and approving the environmental report under the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive and the appropriate assessment under the habitats directive.  Moreover, if, subsequent to a vote, the document was to be amended, then the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would be drawn into a complex legal and scientific area that may have a whole series of unintended consequences regarding scope to make or amend policy.  For example, many Members might want even more flexibility than exists already on one-off housing.  It would be likely that an appropriate assessment would become problematic from a habitats perspective, triggering complex legal mechanisms for which we will be responsible.  It will not be the officials or experts who have worked on this for years.<\/p><p>Our job is as legislators and to provide oversight.  Every Member has a different agenda.  While that is fine, putting that into a national framework for every town, village and area we represent will not end up with the good planning Senators often talk about.  There is a process there for a reason and that is what we are trying to buy into.  This legislation is about putting the whole process around formulating future national planning frameworks on a proper legal footing.  We have done this to the spirit of the law.  That is what Mahon asked for.  Mahon did not ask that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would vote on every decision which comes with a massive planning framework document.  The experts are planners.  Some Members might have some planning training but we are not all experts in it.  If Senators believe they are the right ones to make all planning decisions, then so be it.  However, I am not sure that is the right decision for this country when it comes to planning decisions.  Senators should reflect on these amendments.  They should put politics to one side and look at what we are trying to achieve with this.  A review is proposed after six years.  On Report Stage, we can examine having that review earlier.  These amendments are not a wise move.  I understand the intentions behind them but I am not sure they have been fully thought out from a planning point of view.  Senators should bear in mind these amendments would put all planning decisions involving environmental and other directives on legislators who already have other legislation to deal with.  The Government believes in consultation on this plan and has done so with it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is why we had the process, which will continue.<\/p><p>There is a regional aspect to this and all the different political parties are very much involved.

We have a full open-door policy.  We have discussed it at regional meetings, council meetings, open forums, etc.  Niall Cussens and others from the Department have attended many events.  It is a fully open-book approach, as required under the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  That is what we are trying to do.  If someone doubts that, he or she should say it now.  I assure Senators that this is the case, particularly as I have been around the country discussing the matter.  No question was left unanswered.  The final document reflects the views raised with me at those meetings and at Oireachtas committee meetings.  We have a balanced document but, again, the regional involvement can also add to that or change it as much as possible.  Senators should bear the latter in mind when pressing these amendments.

Everybody is trying to achieve a proper regional structure.  As part of that, we need a democratic and answerable structure which is not necessarily there within the region.  I am only raising this with the Minister of State now because he raised it.  The ratio of elected members to the number of people who inhabit an area is grossly unequal.  For example, Fingal has 92,000 people per member of the regional authority.  I would like to hear the Minister of State give a commitment to rebalance the democratic structure in this regard at some stage.<\/p> <p>The NPF targets are welcome but the metropolitan area strategic plans for the four local authorities in Dublin will be drawn up by a 38-member regional assembly.  As a result, the vote from Longford will be equal to that from Dublin, even though we are dealing with a metropolitan area strategic plan.  There is an enormous democratic deficit in that regard in light of the fact that 60% of the inhabitants within the four Dublin local authority areas will only have 47% of the representation.<\/p> <p>Within local authorities in the past, we have seen coalitions of different people voting for different plans, resulting in no democratic answerability.  There are four local authorities and three metropolitan area strategic plans.  I have tabled an amendment to rebalance the position.

A small area in Dublin for which the former Dublin Docklands Development Authority had responsibility creates 9% of the country's GDP.  However, many of the local authority members from the greater Dublin area will be sidelined because once the metropolitan area strategic plan is passed, the four local authorities will be obliged to consider it in creating their development plans.  The metropolitan area strategic plans will be decided by a very small number of regional members who have no natural affinity with those plans, which relate to Dublin, Cork or wherever.

It relates to development plans in local areas.  Having a vote here is crucial.  There was a misunderstanding regarding what happened when the national framework was launched.  We had a big launch.

Through the Bill, we are trying to achieve good quality planning.  We have good quality planners who might not always have been allowed to do their job properly.  This legislation allows them to do their job properly.  They are very much behind that and the Bill respects that.  If the Senator doubts that, I am happy to tease it out with him.

We went through all that with the committee.  Many of the changes that came through were actually recommended by the committees, and I attended both committees.  If one goes back through all the speeches and recommendations, one will see this reflects the committee members' views.  I believe we have honoured that.<\/p> <p>I understand what the Senator is suggesting but we will end up amending and amending and we will still be here in two years time, and we will need a plan for 2045 at that stage.  That is what happens and we have to face facts in that regard.  The process has to come to an end and it is the Government's job to make a final decision after all of the consultation.  That is what the legislation reflects.  I have been involved in planning a long time and I believe this is the right way to do it.  I have seen other national planning frameworks where, as a councillor, I had no say and, even as a Deputy, there was one occasion where I could not get my hands near the document.  We have gone a long way to get this right.  This legislation copperfastens the process to make sure it will always be done right, given there will be different Governments coming and going.  This is to put a process in place which means national planning frameworks go through a certain process and are dealt with right, and everybody can be involved.  To me, that is right and I believe it should be enough to put the Senator's mind at ease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#HH00800","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>In light of all he has heard, is Senator Warfield pressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#HH00900","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I am pressing amendment No. 34 and I also reserve my right to resubmit it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#JJ00100","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>The amendment has been seconded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"vote","time":1523971800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 13; N\u00edl, 17.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Gavan and Fintan Warfield; N\u00edl, Senators Paudie Coffey and Gabrielle McFadden.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#JJ00500","aye":["1402","1379","1378","1390","1389","1405","1417","1400","1398","1385","1413","1410","1372"],"nay":["1409","1380","1423","1391","1422","1420","1416","1424","1415","1429","1386","1375","1425","1427","1397","1431","1399"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 35:<\/p><blockquote>In page 46, line 28, after &ldquo;approval&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by vote&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#KK00100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 35 has been discussed with amendment No. 34.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#KK00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"vote","time":1523971800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 16; N\u00edl, 18.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Daly and Jennifer Murnane O'Connor; N\u00edl, Senators Paudie Coffey and Gabrielle McFadden.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#KK00400","aye":["1402","1379","1378","1390","1383","1389","1405","1417","1400","1395","1398","1413","1410","1373","1372","1418"],"nay":["1409","1380","1423","1391","1422","1420","1416","1424","1415","1429","1386","1375","1425","1427","1397","1385","1431","1399"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1523971800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p><p>Section 9 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1523971800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 36:<\/p><blockquote>In page 47, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Amendment of section 28 (Ministerial guidelines) of Principal Act<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>10. <\/b>Section 28 of the Principal Act (as amended by section 2 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act of 2015) is amended by deleting subsection (1C).&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This amendment proposes the deletion of the power for the Minister to issue binding directions without consultation.

We had some debate on the matter then.  I opposed the amendment then and my position has not changed.  That was a good while ago, early last autumn.  This amendment relates to section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which provides that planning authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by the Minister in the performance of planning functions, in the determination of planning applications and in the adoption of development plans etc.<\/p> <p>However, section 28 was amended in 2015 by the insertion of a new subsection (1C), which elaborated on the original provisions by introducing a new power whereby the Minister may, within section 28 guidelines, expressly state the specific planning policy requirements to be applied by planning authorities or the board, as appropriate, in the exercise of their functions.  In regard to the content of guidance, this provision enables a distinction to be made between advisory and general commentary on the one hand and specific requirements that must be mandatorily applied by planning authorities in the performance of their planning functions on the other.  This provision was critical in underpinning the revisions to the 2007 apartment standard guidelines, which issued in early 2016 and contained specific new requirements that must be applied to planning authorities concerning minimum apartment sizes, the number of lifts per number of apartments, car parking provision, floor-to-ceiling heights, the provision of dual-aspect apartments etc., thereby ensuring their consistent application by planning authorities.<\/p> <p>These new advisory apartment standard guidelines issued under section 28 represented a change in national planning policy, which must now be implemented by planning authorities in the determination of planning applications and the adoption of development plans.  The inclusion of the relatively new subsection (1C) in section 28 of the 2000 Act further enables future revisions to existing planning guidelines and allows new planning guidelines to be expressed or applied in a clearer manner.  It will improve consistency and certainty in the planning process generally, by distinguishing in policy terms between matters to be determined locally by planning authorities and national policies set by the Minister of the day.  There have been examples in the past where planning guidelines have been differently interpreted and implemented by planning authorities, giving rise to inconsistencies in approach on various issues.  The new provision inserted in 2015, enabling the Minister to require planning authorities to mandatorily apply specific planning requirements, will help to overcome inconsistencies in approach by the planning authorities in the performance of their functions.<\/p> <p>I must oppose the proposal by Senator Grace O'Sullivan to delete the provision.  I understand why she has made the proposal but the reason we made the change a few years ago was that historically, we had seen the guidelines not being followed in some cases and we had to deal with that.

I agree with the Minister of State and his officials in their efforts in that regard.  We have to rely on the professionalism of the professional planners, but let us not get too removed.  Let us bear in mind that city and county councillors have a huge amount of experience and knowledge.  I am constantly reminded by city and county managers, or chief executives as they are now known, that they are always amazed by the local knowledge which people have.  When one lives in a community and walks every nook and cranny of it, one knows everything and notices everything.  One has a feel about a place and about how it ticks and how it operates.  That gives great continuity.  Local government is changing rapidly, particularly in terms of staff turnover and staff experience.  The Minister of State should give very serious consideration to this democratic deficit and the associated issues.

Large numbers of Dublin city councillors have made representations to me on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#LL00700","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>We touched on this earlier when discussing Senator Humphreys's amendment.  I know he had to step out so I did not give the full answer at the time.  I do appreciate and understand the reasons and logic behind these proposed amendments.  We have had some direct engagement with Senator Humphreys.  I thank him for that.  We have discussed this and I understand where these amendments are coming from.  We have also had engagement with some of the councillors from within the city at the regional meetings.  They also would have flagged this with us at an earlier stage.  Likewise, Dublin Chamber of Commerce was in with us recently to discuss some of its concerns about the Bill's effects.  I know it is also working closely with the Senator in that respect.<\/p> <p>While I do understand what those proposing these amendments are getting at, they are unnecessary as the relevant provisions in section 62 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provide appropriate mechanisms for regulating the number of members appointed to regional assemblies through the establishment order process.  We do not believe we need legislation on this issue.  I understand why the Senators want to put these provisions in legislation, but there is a mechanism which can deal with them.<\/p> <p>In addition, there are some other changes included in the formula of this amendment which we do not think would work.  I am happy to go through them, not to be critical, but just to point out some of the changes which we think the amendment could lead to.  The Senators can bear that in mind as we go forward with the discussion.  We can engage further with Members if need be.  We are happy to do that.  This legislation might not be the appropriate place for these provisions, but I understand why people want to achieve this balance.<\/p> <p>Senator Humphreys's amendment specifies a formula for determining the number of appointees to the regional assemblies in order to change their internal balance of power in favour of the large local authorities.  This is an important policy shift which would require further amendments to both the primary and secondary legislation.  It is also meant to get representation based on population trends.  For example, under present arrangements the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly has 38 members, the Southern Regional Assembly has 33 members and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly has 25 members.  This includes the regional assembly members appointed to the Committee of the Regions.<\/p> <p>Based on the 2016 census, if the numbers of members of the regional assemblies were altered in accordance with the ratio of one member to 55,000 residents, as in one of the proposals being put forward in the amendment, then the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly would have 42 members, the Southern Regional Assembly would have 29 members and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly would have 15 members.  I am aware that the Senator proposes a minimum of 18 members and a maximum of 45 members for the regional assemblies.  I will come to the issues raised by that proposal in due course.  The amendment also proposes a number of complex alterations to the legislation.  I will work through each part of the amendment in order if that is what people want me to do.  I am happy to do that. <\/p> <p>Under the Local Government Act 1991 (Regional Assemblies) (Establishment) Order 2014, SI 573 of 2014, no local authority appoints fewer than two elected members to the regional assemblies.  Reducing this to a minimum of one, as the section 43(4A)(i) proposed by the amendment provides, while implementing the ratio of one elected member to 55,000 residents, as set out in the proposed section 43(4A)(iv), would leave some areas with a single representative at regional level, particularly in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.  Furthermore, in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly the Senator's proposals would create a situation where representatives from three local authorities, namely, Galway, Mayo and Donegal county councils, which currently account for ten out of 25 members on the regional assembly, would form a majority of eight out of 15, outnumbering the representatives from Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Galway city.  Raising the number of members from 15 to the proposed minimum of 18 might also ameliorate the imbalance caused by the arrangements proposed by the Senator, but it is unclear under the proposals how these supernumerary numbers would be distributed.  Again, I am just pointing out some of the difficulties with the amendment.  I am sure that these can be looked at and debated.<\/p> <p>There is a reference to \"electors\" in the proposed section 43(4A)(ii) but elsewhere in the amendment reference is made to \"residents\" and to \"population resident\".  The terminology used in the amendment is inconsistent.  In addition, the language in section 43(4A)(ii) does not propose a ratio for numbers of electors to elected members.  It is also the case that the size of the electorate is generally proportional to the size of the resident population and therefore the relative proportion of electors to elected members across local authorities would not be expected to differ significantly from the ratio of residents to elected members.  <\/p> <p>On the proposed section 43(4A)(iii), in practical terms and based on analysis conducted by my Department, the complex proposals set out in this section of the proposed amendment would not appear to make any difference to the numbers of elected members on regional assemblies, if implemented.  Based on our calculation, when rounded to the nearest whole number there would be no change in the proposed numbers of regional assembly members if ratios of representatives to residents are made to fall within the plus or minus 10% range proposed.  It is therefore unclear what this part of the proposed amendment is intended to achieve.  <\/p> <p>On the proposed section 43(4A)(iv), it is unclear which local authority it is proposed that members be added to or removed from should a regional assembly's membership fall outside the range of 18 to 45 members, as proposed in this section.  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly, for instance, would have 15 members under the ratio set out in the proposed amendment.  This would be raised to 18 as per the proposal but it is not clear how the three extra representatives would be allocated in a manner which is fair to all.<\/p> <p>To conclude, I am opposing this amendment for the reasons I have outlined, although I am willing to engage further on the issue with a view to examining, if required, the composition of the assemblies.  To clarify, we are willing to engage on the issue with a view to examining whether it is necessary to alter the composition of the assemblies through the appropriate legislative mechanism, which is the establishment order, rather than this planning and development Bill.  The Senator might want to engage with us further on that issue between now and Report Stage.  We have already had some brief discussions.  I know that the efforts here are genuine.  It is hard to get amendments fully right when tabling them.  We recognise that there is a deficit there and we are willing to work on it through the appropriate mechanism if Members would agree to engage with us on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#MM00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply, including his reply to amendment No. 47a, which has been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#MM00300","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I meant to say that at the start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#MM00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I do appreciate it.  I do not say that lightly.  It was quite a comprehensive reply.  I do not particularly want to press this amendment because there are difficulties in drafting detailed amendments on this issue and in respect of the impact on other legislation.  However, there is an enormous difference, for example, between Fingal, which has 98,000 residents to one representative, and Longford, which has 21,000 residents to one representative.  In the South Dublin County Council area the ratio is 92,000:1 compared to Offaly where it is 39,000:1.  There is a really significant democratic deficit in this respect.<\/p> <p>There is also a really significant concentration in respect of planning and the development of these regional metropolitan area strategic plans, of which there are three.  I believe these are a key part of the overall strategy.  I will move the amendment on Report Stage.  I will not press it this evening.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to engage with me between now and Report Stage on bringing forward something that would allow for rebalancing in respect of the three new metropolitan area strategic plans.  Speaking as a Dubliner, a proud Dub, it is very difficult to tell councillors that they have a minority input and say in respect of a major economic strategic plan for their areas, which then has to be transposed into their development plans.  One can be anxious when one is in a minority.  Councillors from those three areas have unique understandings.  The Minister of State has talked about professional planners, but the councillors themselves know the issues on the ground.  They know what is needed in terms of density.  When people speak about strategic economic zones within Dublin, the four local authorities know exactly where they are.  They know what the densities are.  They know the level of strategic planning which needs to be done to enhance them as engines for the economy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I stated, 47% of the population will have 60% of the representation.  The majority of those who will vote on what will go into a development plan for these areas have no direct connection with them.  We do not have to look back too far to see the implications of this approach.  We had, for example, coalitions of councillors on Dublin's northside from the large parties voted for unpopular decisions on the southside and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We also saw what happened in Fingal.<br\/><br\/>The amendment provides a mechanism for the strategic zones.  We must ensure that those who make decisions are answerable to their electorates.  Currently, elected representatives in one area, for example, Longford, who make decisions regarding development in other areas, for example, Cork or Dublin, are not answerable to electors in the affected areas.  They often do not understand the intricacies of the zones.  I will withdraw the amendment if the Minister of State undertakes to engage with me on this issue before Report Stage.

Given that various proposals are being developed and discussed with a view to bringing them to Government, this is an opportune time to have a conversation on this issue.  We will engage before Report Stage and I will examine the matter again in that context.  I recognise that the Senator is genuinely seeking to address a problem.  However, the issue is one of finding the right mechanism and providing for it in the right place, which is what we will do.<\/p> <p>To respond to Senator Murnane O'Connor, we all recognise the role councillors have in this area.  Councillors were very much involved at various levels and we met them.  They are the ultimate decision makers on local development plans and are also involved in regional and national development plans.  They make the final decisions and must face the people before Members of the Oireachtas do so.  Most of us were councillors at some point and will have engaged in the process of drawing up a development plan.  I played a serious role in this matter and enjoyed it.  This does not mean we do everything perfectly but we try to do what is right.

While the amendment is genuinely well-intentioned, I oppose it because the water framework directive 2000\/60\/EC is already given general effect in section 1A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  More specifically, the directive is also given effect in the context of the forward planning functions of planning authorities by way of section 10(2)(cb) of the principal Act, as amended, relating to the content of development plans.<\/p> <p>I draw the Senator's attention to the commitment given by the Department in the publication, Public Consultation on the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, 2018 to 2021, to prepare a high-level guidance document for planning authorities on the relationship between physical planning and river basin management planning for the purpose of the development of river basin management plans under the water framework directive.

I see the merit of the proposal, which is primarily related to increasing transparency in the planning system.  In this regard, issues relating to political donations generally are addressed in the standards in public office legislation and the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which was enacted on 28 July 2012 and significantly enhanced the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland, thereby addressing many of the issues that were central to the recommendations made on political finance in the final report of the Mahon tribunal, and also in the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999.<\/p> <p>During the debate on this matter in the D&aacute;il, I indicated that my officials would explore the possibility of inserting some provision or reference regarding political donations in the planning legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is currently being undertaken but will require the obtaining of legal advice.<\/p><p>The legal advice may well say that the matter of political donations is already sufficiently addressed in the legislation that I have just mentioned and consequently there is no necessity to have a specific provision in the planning code.

Local councillors up and down the country up until recently have had to pay to make an observation on a planning application and then there was a question mark over whether, if they had not paid regarding a planning observation, they could then go on to An Bord Plean&aacute;la with a submission.<\/p><p>The day-to-day work of local councillors, as many would be aware, is representing residence groups regarding major planning applications.  Sometimes those observations may be in support of a planning application.  For the sake of transparency, to ask councillors who are on a very low salary to make a payment to make an observation on a planning permission is unacceptable in this day and age.  An Taisce, which is a prescribed organisation, can make a submission on a planning matter up and down the country without having to pay and yet we see councillors, practically on a voluntary basis, given their salaries, having to make a payment to do so in their local authority.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the two amendments.  Both amendments have the same purpose, namely, to try to reduce the financial criteria for councillors.<\/p><p>The Minister of State may state that the sum is quite low but if one is from a major urban area, whether that is Cork, Dublin or Limerick, there may not only be many planning applications but many applications on the same site.  I have seen developments with up to seven live planning applications, all running at the same time.  If a councillor wanted to make an observation on all seven, that would cost &euro;140.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will respond by stating he is sympathetic towards the amendment but this is not the Bill to do it in.  If so, I would ask him to give a commitment to a date and time at which that will be removed because it is unfair to ask councillors on a miserable salary to make that financial commitment to submit an observation on a large-scale development.  If the Minister of State is to so respond, he should be short and sweet.  If he will not allow it and support it as part of this Bill, I will withdraw it and resubmit it on Report Stage if the Minister of State will give me a timeframe for when he will introduce regulation to allow councillors make an observation free of charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#OO01200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>This is perhaps one of the most important pieces in this jigsaw in terms of public accountability and public engagement.  Neither the Minister of State nor I want councillors in backrooms talking to qualified planners and chief executives about what should and should not be granted permission and how to determine planning applications because that is not the role of county councillors.<\/p> <p>My understanding is that councillors are the guardians and custodians of their county development plans.  They are proud to play the major part in the forming and shaping of those plans.  They have been and will be curtailed but it makes sense because we must have regard to the hierarchy of planning, from the national planning framework to the regional planning, the county development plans, the strategic development plans, local area plans, LAPs, and even urban and village plans that some progressive local authorities promote and push.  As I have stated previously, we need an educational programme to explain to both elected members and the public generally the hierarchy of the planning system.

It is a foregone conclusion and I hope the Minister of State will confirm that here and now for the record of the House because councillors are keen to know.<br\/><br\/>Planners do not always get it right.  I have been involved in 30 or 40 planning objections in the past 12 months.  Some of them were not even in my name but I have written them and they all mostly relate to my own county development plan because I know it intimately.  I have been involved in three of them in that county.  In some cases, the people have had to pay themselves, but I have given them the little expertise I have, and it is more knowledge than expertise because I know that particular plan well.  We have been successful.  In some cases, we have had to appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and we have been successful there.  It is interesting to look at the success rates in some local authorities.  That is not to say &quot;well done&quot; or <i>vice versa<\/i>to the planners, but they do not always get it right.  They are sometimes motivated by other considerations.  There is an economic consideration that is also part of the functions of a local authority, and rightly so.  The difficulty is that where my proposal differs from Senator Humphreys is that I acknowledge there could be difficulties if we roll out a free for all for everyone because what will possibly happen is that councillors will come back in 12 months and say they are now doing hundreds of objections on a monthly basis.

The Declaration of Independence and the democratic programme of the First D&aacute;il are northern stars or beacons of what we as a society, and those of us involved in political activism and life should aspire to achieve, namely, the right to a home, to decent healthcare, the right of the State to own its natural resources for the common wealth, well-being and prosperity of its citizens.  These are timely and important reminders that should be more prominent.  Through Senator Swanick's work on this Bill ,they can be a deeper reminder and can impel Members as they move forward with the political responsibility they are privileged to hold.<\/p> <p>It would be good as part of the centenary celebrations to put a copy of the Declaration of Independence and of the democratic programme up in this House as a visible reminder, celebration and commemoration.  Pieces of art have recently been installed in this building, which is welcome.  These significant historic documents are also worthy of a place in the course of those celebrations.  I commend the proposers of the Bill, support its passage and look forward to hearing the Minister's response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041700002#QQ00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1523971800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  Section 2 is the substantive section and while my predecessor indicated on Second Stage that the Government is not opposing the Bill, it is important to note that several annual events are already fixed in the official commemorative calendar, including the Easter Sunday commemoration at the GPO in remembrance of those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom during Easter week of 1916 and is recognised as the seminal moment on our journey towards self-determination and independence.  There also is the commemoration of the 1916 Rising at Arbour Hill on the first Wednesday that falls between 3 and 12 May, as well as the July national day of commemoration in remembrance of all Irish men and women who died in wars or on service with the United Nations.<\/p> <p>The convening of the First D&aacute;il on 21 January 1919 is one of the key historical events that will be remembered by the State in 2019.  This will be the subject of a State commemoration next year, together with a major programme of events being organised by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I note that section 2 provides for commemoration by the State of 21 January each year as the \"Declaration of Independence Day\" but does not set out the form of any such commemoration or expressly state that a Minister of the Government should be responsible for the commemoration and this is something I would like to examine in advance of Report Stage.
