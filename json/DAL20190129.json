It is the first time since 1999 that the country's nurses and midwives are going on strike across the health service.  It will cause disruption to many patients because of the cancellation of appointments and the cancellation of elective outpatient surgery and it will have an impact generally on the health service.<\/p>  <p>  Nurses and midwives in the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, have been seeking engagement with the State for some time.  They have given plenty of notice.  There is no doubt that the nursing profession is under pressure.  I refer to nurses working in acute wards, in intensive care, in theatres, and in accident and emergency departments.  They are under enormous pressure and morale is low.  There is a significant human resource issue and without question pay and conditions are central to the low level of morale, in addition to the impact hospital overcrowding has had over a consistent period on the working conditions and pressure nurses are under.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that agency nurses, for example, cost the health service &euro;1.4 million a week.  That tells its own story as to what is going on in terms of shortages.  The recruitment and retention of nurses is central to the dispute.  There are alternative views on the matter.  The Public Service Pay Commission has said there is not a retention or recruitment issue but I have doubts about that.  It is important to put down a marker in that we need to have more data on how many graduates are leaving student nursing colleges every year to go overseas.  The numbers are significant.  We must also examine how many nurses we are recruiting from overseas.<\/p><p>The system is out of kilter by any measure.  Entire cohorts of students are moving to the UK, Canada, Australia and other countries.  We then have to recruit huge numbers from overseas at significantly greater cost.  I refer to the cost of nurses with third-level qualifications and, likewise, the cost of orientation and ensuring that people who come from overseas are properly equipped, sufficiently capable and so on.  There are huge costs in that.<br\/><br\/>I read a very good article in the <i>Evening Echo<\/i>last week in which Ms Naomi O'Donovan, a midwife at Cork University Maternity Hospital, and Ms Margaret Frahill<b>, <\/b>a nurse manager in Mercy University Hospital, outlined their concerns regarding patients missing out on certain care.  Their concerns are the result of the pressures involved.<br\/><br\/>The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, held a hearing.  The matter may now go to a full hearing of the Labour Court.  The Minister seems to have indicated that he is anxious for the industrial relations machinery of the State to be deployed to help resolve this dispute.  It has taken some time to engage that machinery.  If the matter is referred to a full hearing of the Labour Court, will the Government abide by the outcome, just as it did in the Garda pay dispute some years ago?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548770700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Before I begin, I wish to offer my condolences and those of the Government to the family and friends of the people who lost their lives on the roads in the week gone by, particularly the four young men in Donegal who lost their lives on Sunday last.  I know that M&iacute;chael, Sean, Daniel and John were very much loved in their communities.  Their deaths will be mourned across the entire country.  Although their laughter may have been silenced, we remember their lives and the promise that has been cut short.  Our thoughts and sympathies are with the Roarty, Harkin, Scott and Harley families at this time.<\/p>  <p>  In answer to the questions the Deputy raised, the Cabinet discussed the pending nursing strike at its meeting this morning.  We are very aware that the INMO, the largest union representing nurses and midwives, intends to engage in a 24-hour strike tomorrow.  I certainly have no doubt about the depth of feeling on the part of nurses and midwives regarding their pay and their conditions.  That was reflected in an overwhelming ballot in favour of strike action.  I also have no doubt about the considerable public support that nurses and midwives will have should they choose to engage in strike action.  Efforts are ongoing at the Labour Court to see if we can have a full hearing there, with a view to a recommendation thereafter.  Obviously, if a recommendation is made, the Government will have to consider it.  It would be very rare for the Government to reject a recommendation of the Labour Court, but we would certainly have to consider it if such a recommendation arises or if we reach that point.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, I should say that in terms of patients and their care, the damage is already done.  More than 1,000 operations and thousands of outpatient appointments have been cancelled.  Even if the strike is called off at the last minute, it will not be possible to reschedule those appointments for tomorrow.  Unfortunately, in the context of patient care, the harm has already been done.<\/p>  <p>  We want to avert the strike if possible; we want to find a solution.  That solution has to be affordable for taxpayers.  It has to be fair to all public servants and it has to be fair to patients.  When I say fair to taxpayers, what do I mean?  A solution must be affordable for taxpayers.  We ran a small budget surplus last year and we hope to run one again this year, although that may not be the case if we end up with a hard Brexit and no deal.  It would not be fair to taxpayers to borrow money to fund pay increases.  There are good reasons a country might borrow money, but borrowing money to fund pay increases is not good policy and only leads to pay cuts down the line.  I do not want to subject anyone to that ever again.  It needs to be fair to all public servants, other people working in the health service and individuals working in other parts of the public service.  If we do a special deal for one group, it will not be possible to do the same deal for everyone.  That just would not be affordable.  We need to look at the wider picture and be fair to all public servants as well.  We also need to be fair to patients.  No matter how wealthy the country is, the health budget is limited.  I would not like to see money being diverted away from new medicines, equipment or treatments to fund pay increases.  We have to bear all those things in mind.<\/p><p>It has to be affordable for taxpayers, it has to fair to all public servants, including other people working in the health service, and it has to be fair to patients.  If the Deputy can find a solution in that space, the Government will be happy to be part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548771300,"counter":10,"content":"<p>One can say that about any additional expenditure or additional tax relief.  Ultimately, the taxpayer has to pay for it in some shape or form.  The Garda pay dispute some time ago was resolved by the Labour Court.  The Government accepted that Labour Court recommendation ultimately and it did not upset or undermine the public service stability agreement and the public service pay norms.  There are creative ways and mechanisms through which these issues can be dealt with because it is not today or yesterday that they were raised.  I can go back to the time of the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, in the Department of Health, when there was an ongoing row with the INMO and he denied that salary was an issue then or that they were being paid worse than others in other English-speaking countries.  It is not today or yesterday that this claim has been on the table.  What has been lacking is a proactive, creative way of resolving it, unlike the approach adopted in the Garda pay dispute, which the Government contributed to in the end because I do not believe the Labour Court came up with its recommendation out of thin air.

Our thoughts are with all of those affected.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.<\/p><p>I am struck by the very <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach the Taoiseach is taking to the fact that in less than 24 hours, members of the INMO are due to commence industrial action in the first of a number of 24-hour stoppages over the coming weeks and his detachment from the fact that members of the PNA will also engage in industrial action.  I am sure he knows, as I do, that strike action is the very last thing nurses or midwives, or any medical professional for that matter, wish to undertake but, regrettably, nurses and midwives have been backed into a corner and forced to engage in industrial action because of the action, or inaction, of the Government.<\/p><p>Every day, every week, as the Taoiseach will be well aware, procedures are cancelled across our hospitals.  That is due not least to the recruitment and retention crisis affecting the nursing and midwifery professions, and the associated issue of pay is one of the most significant problems affecting the health service.  It has been an ongoing issue for many years, yet the Government has completely and abjectly failed to address this and the situation has deteriorated.  The Taoiseach cannot pretend that this is an issue that takes him by surprise.<\/p><p>Nurses, midwives and their unions have continually sought meaningful engagement to address the problem of staffing shortages as well as pay issues but he has brushed their concerns aside.  It is our nurses and midwives who have acted in a responsible and mature manner.  For his part, the Taoiseach has decided to disengage.  Nurses make a significant contribution to the health service and to society.  They deserve - and I have absolutely no doubt will enjoy - our full support in their demand for a better health service.  Last April, we passed a motion in this House, which demanded that the Government engage meaningfully with the unions to draw a roadmap to full pay equality with an implementation plan to deliver same within a short timeframe, not the eight years that it has offered up.<\/p> <p> At the eleventh hour, with thousands of surgeries cancelled and with strike action due to commence in the morning, will the Taoiseach do as the nursing unions have asked and directly intervene?  Will he intervene as a matter of urgency?  Will he listen to what the nurses and their unions are telling him?  They believe that this dispute can be resolved within the strictures and the conditions of the pay agreement.  They want the Taoiseach, as the employer and as the Head of Government, to intervene, stop sitting on the sidelines, get involved and sort this out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900005#C00900","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548771900,"counter":19,"content":"<p>It is important to put on the record of the House once again that we have a pay deal already not just with nurses and midwives but with all public servants, and that pay deal runs until 2020.  It provides for pay increases of approximately 7% over that period, full pay restoration for anyone earning under &euro;80,000, increments,and  special increases for the low paid and those recruited after 2012.  That comes at a considerable cost - a cost of approximately &euro;400 million this year alone.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know where we will be as a country in ten or 12 weeks' time.  If we end up in a scenario whereby we have a hard Brexit with no deal, that will change things.  The Minister for Finance will produce figures later on what the Department of Finance's estimates are on how a no-deal Brexit could impact on our economy.  They are similar to the figures produced by the Central Bank last week and they are less optimistic than those produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI and Copenhagen Economics earlier.  They indicate that our economy will slow down.  It will not go back into recession and it will not be like the financial crisis ten years ago, but our economy will slow down, and while employment will continue to grow, unemployment will rise as well.  In ten or 12 weeks, we could find ourselves needing to find a lot of money to save people's jobs because there are people working in the food industry, agriculture, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and small exporters whose jobs may be under threat in a few weeks.  I have to be Taoiseach for the whole country and I have to bear in mind that in a few weeks or a few months, we could be talking about job losses in certain sectors of the economy and not pay rises, and it would be irresponsible of me not to admit that to this House and not to put it into this debate for discussion.<\/p>  <p>  On intervention and engagement, we have a mechanism by which we resolve disputes such as this and we have State bodies that engage in dispute resolution.

I hope none of this is coming from the Taoiseach's spin machine.  We have all read the INMO submission regarding this dispute which shows that the starting salary of a staff nurse is &euro;29,000 a year and only goes up to &euro;45,000 after 15 years.  That goes to the nub of why we are here having this argument.<\/p>  <p>  I want to say, on behalf of Solidarity-People before Profit, that we fully support the nurses if they go out on strike. <\/p><p>I hope that they will not be put down by spin machines and propaganda that tries to make them out as being totally selfish.  The Taoiseach and his Government are standing up, all macho, and shaping up to the nurses.  They have a hard neck to think they can blame them for taking action when Brexit is happening.  How dare he mention Brexit in the same sentence as their strike.  These people do not want to go on strike, have not done so for 20 years and have only done so once in their 100 year history.  I will read from the submissions given to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by many nurses.  One starts: &quot;I love being a nurse.&quot;  The statement continues:<\/p><blockquote>I don&rsquo;t love living at home because I can&rsquo;t afford to save and pay rent.  I don&rsquo;t love that my brother makes more money as a waiter.  I don&rsquo;t love missing breaks because we&rsquo;re short staffed.  I don&rsquo;t love having to cancel any plans I had after work because I&rsquo;m so exhausted.  I don&rsquo;t love telling my patients there is a 10-hour wait to see a doctor.<\/blockquote><p>The Taoiseach should read it.  He should know, having been involved in the health service, that these are the lives that they lead.  Unless this dispute is resolved by putting pay at its centre and treating them justly, the Taoiseach cannot continue to stand here, earning six times what a nurse earns.  Is he worth six nurses?  I think six nurses are worth much more.  We cannot contain that situation forever.  Pay has to be put at the heart of this and Joe Public knows that is the reason because Joe Public wants a better health service and knows that unless we pay and retain nurses, we will continue with 3,000 children waiting to see a psychiatrist for the first time, a trolley crisis, and a health service that is creaking at the seams.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health cannot resolve it unless they deal with pay for nurses.  The Taoiseach may end up dealing with it but he should not blame the nurses with regard to Brexit or for the cancellations that may take place because of tomorrow's strike or next week's strikes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900007#E02100","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548772800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I have absolutely no doubt about the depth of feeling of midwives and nurses about their pay, terms and conditions.

As others have said, looking at nurses' pay scales and the ongoing problems of recruitment and retention of nursing staff in our health system, it is little wonder that 95% of INMO members voted for the action.  The Taoiseach should take any steps necessary to prevent this strike from happening.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, as the Taoiseach will be aware, the European Medicines Agency said farewell to London and the staff are now moving to Amsterdam.  Their departure reminds us once again that we are now only 59 days away from Brexit.  I think we were all heartened over the weekend by the comments of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs that the agreed backstop will not be renegotiated.  We also saw over the weekend the clear wishes, as expressed in various polls, of our people North and South that no kind of hard border will be allowed to return to this island.  I note that the T&aacute;naiste has indicated that a codicil might be added to the political declaration regarding the backstop.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the 21 articles of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement will be fully adhered to, especially given the presence of Articles 17 and 20?  Can the Taoiseach also confirm that no works of any kind are taking place anywhere along the Border on roads or lay-bys to facilitate the installation of any hard border apparatus?<\/p>  <p>  Events at Westminster tonight and over the next four weeks will, I hope, produce a much softer Brexit than that which we rightly fear.  Like other Deputies, I am grateful for the work of our civil servants and indeed the Government in producing the contingency action plan last December and for the heads of the omnibus Bill last week.  I think the Taoiseach told us that the full Bill will be ready in three or four weeks.  The 17 sections prepared by the nine Departments seem fairly comprehensive, although I notice that areas such as fisheries, which are not covered in the withdrawal agreement, are still missing.  Are all the relevant sections of the December contingency action plan and the 87 European Commission preparedness notices all addressed in the omnibus Bill or must we wait for the secondary legislation?  Constituents have noted that, given a possible no-deal Brexit, much of the proposed contingency legislation - on health, education and pensions, for example - protects the rights of UK residents and citizens in the Republic.  Is the Government aware of any similar UK contingency legislation being prepared to protect the rights of our people in the North and in England, Scotland and Wales?<\/p><p>The Taoiseach told me, a few months ago, that bilateral negotiations on legislation with the UK would have to take place regarding the common travel area, which many legal scholars say, of course, is just based on precedence.  Will those bilateral discussions involve all the other crucial areas in order that there is full reciprocity for all our people on this island?<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach seek derogation from state aid rules to offer support such as the future growth loan scheme to our exporters?  Given that we are a significant net contributor to the EU budget, have the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance begun the negotiation framework for a financial support package for Ireland as the member state which will be by far the most impacted by Brexit?<\/p> <p> I am glad the Taoiseach has told us that the Minister for Finance has done some costings, which he is prepared to produce as those of us in opposition have been calling for.

We are struggling to recruit in large parts of the public and private sectors at the moment.  It is, in part, a feature of the fact that we are almost approaching full employment.  It is also a feature of the fact that, when it comes to healthcare in particular, we live in an international labour market in which people with healthcare skills are highly sought after.  England, Scotland and most of Europe pay less than Ireland does, but even parts of the world that pay more, like the Middle East and Australia, are also struggling to recruit healthcare staff.

We are not projecting a return to recession.  Employment will continue to grow but not fast enough to keep pace with an expanding labour market.  Under our projections unemployment will rise, therefore, and instead of running a surplus this year, we will run a deficit in the region of 0.5% of GNP, which is manageable.  It will put us in a different position financially but one we can manage and one we have put the country in a good position for.

There was no lawful adoption in Ireland before 1952.  For a period after that date, there was a widespread practice of informal adoption.  Sometimes that took place within the wider family and sometimes under the aegis of a church or voluntary agencies such as St. Patrick's Guild.<\/p><p>In May 2018, 126 cases of illegal registrations were finally confirmed by Tusla following an analysis of files from St Patrick's Guild.  In those cases, the adoptive parents were incorrectly registered as the birth parents on the birth certificates between 1946 and 1969.  Instead of applying under the Act and registering with the Adoption Authority, infant children were simply transferred directly into the hands of their new adoptive parents.  The information provided to register the births was falsified and the children involved were given false birth certificates and listed as being the children of the adoptive parents.  That is where the illegal registration occurred.  That generation of children are now adults in their 40s, 50s, 60s and even 70s.  They are without the benefit of a valid adoption order and their status within their families is legally uncertain.<\/p><p>There is an unknown number of informal adoption arrangements, and some may not be documented at all.  The people identified to date are in limbo or a no man's land as regards certainty of status.  We are informed that a scoping exercise is under way.  We know already that a further 748 adoption cases are of concern, all of which relate to adoptions by St. Patrick's Guild, which is one adoption society out of many.  To date, the Minister has not indicated what legislative action will be taken to address the illegal registrations and to provide legal certainty to those affected.<\/p><p>It is important to note that a birth certificate is not an identity document, nor does a birth certificate amount to proof of the family relationship that it asserts that is admissible in court.  The Bill seeks to address this uncertain status.  It defines the process of informal adoption as involving the placing of a child into the care of a married couple, neither of whom was the parent of the child concerned, with a view to the child being held out and considered for all purposes to be the child of that couple, born to them in wedlock, or to be their adopted child, without any regard to the need for an adoption order; and the furnishing of information in connection with registering the child's birth purporting to show the couple to be the natural parents of the child.<br\/><br\/>Under this legislation, where documentation is available and an individual desires a valid adoption, a person who was informally adopted could apply to the Circuit Court for a declaration of adoption.  If satisfied with the evidence presented, the court may make a declaration that the applicant is deemed to have been validly adopted on a particular date.  The Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths will then cancel the false birth certificate while the Adoption Authority of Ireland will issue a valid adoption certificate.<br\/><br\/>The second remedy deals with individuals who may have been told and had believed that they were indeed the natural children of those who reared them as their parents.  They had no reason to believe they were adopted, regularly or irregularly.  There may be no surviving records to enable them to trace the original parties to this informal arrangement.  The Bill will change the rules of evidence to protect those who wish to preserve what they had considered to be the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It incorporates into civil law a rule that has been applied in criminal law since 1992, namely, that a document purporting to be a birth certificate is evidence, admissible in court, of the family relationship that it indicates.  Evidence contradicting a birth certificate proffered in court will be inadmissible where the person whose birth certificate it is has consistently been treated, with regard to the rights and duties of parents and children in relation to each other, as the child of the<br\/><br\/>persons named on the certificate as his or her parents.  This new rule would not apply where someone fraudulently procured their own birth certificate.  The purpose of this is to allow people who have now been thrown into no man's land to have this very irregular situation addressed. <br\/><br\/>The Minister is offering social workers to people in their 40s, 50s, 60s or 70s so that they can pursue the issue.  These people do not need social workers.  They need a fairly simple court process to regularise their status.  It is the children of today who are homeless who need the attention and support of social workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900017#P03100","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548778500,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1548778500,"counter":185,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900018#Q00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548778500,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1548778500,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900018#Q00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1548778500,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900018#Q00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548778500,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Amendment of Orders of Reference of Special Joint Committee on Climate Action: Motion","time":1548778500,"counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1548778500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Order of the D&aacute;il of 3rd July, 2018, relating to the Special Joint Committee on Climate Action, be amended in paragraph (g) by the deletion of &lsquo;31st January, 2019&rsquo;

There are six Bills on the priority list for publication this session.  Three are Brexit-related; the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill, which is the primary legislation for the spring programme; the regulated professions (health and social care) (amendment) Bill; and the European Parliament elections (amendment) Bill to enable the number of MEPs for Ireland to increase.  The remaining three Bills on the priority list consist of the constitutional amendment Bills necessary to facilitate the referendums on extending the right to vote in Presidential elections to Irish citizens abroad and to change the law regarding divorce, as well as enabling legislation to establish a tribunal to deal with issues regarding cervical cancer screening. <\/p>  <p>  The programme reflects the need for the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to prioritise work on Brexit-related legislation to ensure that the necessary primary and secondary legislation can be enacted and commenced by 29 March 2019 in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan, the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill comprises vital legislation that will need to be enacted prior to 29 March in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The general scheme of the proposed primary legislative actions was published by Government on 24 January.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, is the lead Minister for the overall Bill and will lead the Second Stage debate on it in the D&aacute;il, assisted by the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee.  The draft Bill focuses on the broad themes of protecting our citizens and assisting the economy, enterprise and jobs.  Amendments to the Interpretation Act 2005, which would be required in the event of an orderly Brexit with a transition period, are also included.  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan and in the update provided on 15 January 2019, work is progressing in parallel on the required secondary legislation.  On 15 January, the Government approved the drafting of statutory instruments covering a wide range of issues where secondary legislation is needed, from recognition of driver licences to recognition of some qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  As timelines are tight, the Government will work very closely with all Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in ensuring that the necessary no-deal Brexit-related legislation will be in place before 29 March.  This Bill will complement the steps currently under way at EU level to prepare for the UK's withdrawal, notably as regards the implementation of the European Commission's contingency action plan and the associated legislative provisions.  The draft omnibus Bill may need to be adjusted in light of ongoing developments.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from the legislative priorities, the spring programme also includes 32 Bills that are expected to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny and work is under way on a further 91 Bills.  Work is also continuing on other legislation across all Departments and several Bills that are at an advanced stage will be introduced in the coming weeks to be progressed alongside those currently on the D&aacute;il Order Paper.  Those on the Order Paper include the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill 2018, the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018.  It is intended to prepare and publish a further legislative programme towards the end of March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900018#Q02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1548778500,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Last Friday, only after significant pressure from the Opposition, the heads of the Brexit legislation were finally published by the Government.  Even though Ireland is the country which would be worst hit by a no-deal Brexit, we are near the back of the pack when it comes to legislative preparations.  In fact, we are by some distance the least prepared of the economies that would be significantly exposed to a no-deal Brexit.  For example, the Dutch published their draft legislation early last November.  It was sent to the parliament where it was discussed and suspended until this week, when the government negotiated amendments with the opposition.  Because legislation was published two months ago, it has been scrutinised and the opposition has been given full access to Ministers, officials and background work.<\/p>  <p>  Now that we have draft legislation we need the background material relevant to the various sectors covered by the overarching Bill to be published.  There are as many as 11 different sectoral impacts.  We need to see the analysis that lies behind the proposals and whether the measures proposed address the issues that have been raised over the past two years in different fora and studies.  Can the Taoiseach give us an assurance that he will immediately publish this background work?  In regard to the drafting of statutory amendments, there might be a need for a more comprehensive presentation to the House on the detail of all of those statutory instruments.<\/p>  <p>  Given that today the Taoiseach has finally published the Government's assumptions on the fiscal impact of a no-deal Brexit, can he explain why he refused to provide this information on the many occasions we have asked for it in the past two months?  Interestingly, the projections published today show a significantly lower impact than that projected by the Central Bank study only a few days ago.  As the Taoiseach knows, the Central Bank is headed by an eminent economist who is the favourite to hold Europe's most important economic post.  Can the Taoiseach explain the basis on which the Government has decided that the impact of a no-deal scenario will be lower than that projected by the Central Bank of Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900018#Q02100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1548778500,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I wish to speak about the omnibus Brexit legislation, the heads of which were published last Friday.<\/p><p>Obviously, we need to have a methodology.

Is the Bill to be dealt with entirely in a committee of the full House?  I honestly submit that is the best way to do it.  The notion of referring it to a particular select committee with either Ministers or spokespeople alternating would be cumbersome and not the correct way to do it.  Also, the importance of this legislation commands the centrality of this Chamber.  I ask the Taoiseach to agree to that.  <\/p> <p> The exact nature of the legislation to be enacted will be contingent on decisions that are being made this week and next week in the House of Commons, in Westminster.  I am reluctant to even put this in these terms but I will come to that.  The British Prime Minister today is lobbying her own backbenchers to vote for an amendment that undermines the withdrawal agreement and the backstop that she negotiated and agreed to formally twice, and persuaded her Government to formally endorse.  It is a backstop that was largely shaped by her own red lines and her submission that it would have all UK application.

It is imperative that we have ongoing briefings not just at leadership level but spokesperson by spokesperson.

It is a basic democratic call at this stage to let people make their decision if that eventuality occurs.<\/p>  <p>  My question is more generally about the Taoiseach's legislative priorities.  I urge him to make a priority of legislating to change the income thresholds for social housing because an absolute cull is happening of the social housing waiting lists where much of the time people are being forced because rents in the private sector are extortionate to do overtime on a regular basis or get marginal increases in their income that do not allow them to buy a house on the private market or pay the extortionate rents but are then taking them over the income threshold for social housing, which has not changed since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  I was talking to a council worker the other day who has been on the list for years.  In his wildest dreams his income would not buy him a house in the greater D&uacute;n Laoghaire area where rents are absolutely shocking.  To pay his rent he has been forced to do Saturday overtime for the past year and a half or two years, and he has to do it because there are staff shortages, but he has now been taken off the housing list.  That is happening again and again.  A nurse came into our office recently who is on the housing list since 2004.  She has just been taken off the list because her income has gone marginally over the limit.  That is not acceptable.  I would not mind if the Taoiseach had an affordable housing scheme, which he promised, so that those who go over the limit have some alternative available to them but despite promise after promise, we do not have an affordable housing scheme.  Is the Taoiseach going to raise the income threshold for social housing to stop this cull of people from the housing list or, at the very least, could he say that basic pay is what should be taken into account?  It is outrageous that marginal increases in income because of overtime that is enforced should take them off the housing list that they have been on for years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900019#R00900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1548779100,"counter":214,"content":"<p>To return to Brexit, last week there was a lot of speculation that in the event of no deal we might end up with border controls in Rotterdam or Calais.

That was not believable.  In Davos, the Taoiseach then seemed to indicate that we might see Army personnel back on the Border.  That has created a real sense of confusion and those in Westminster are using it by saying it represents confusion in the Irish position, which gives them hope that we may move.  Will the Taoiseach clarify something in fairly simple terms?  I presume the Government's line is that we will legislate for the package of measures in the event of no deal but the key issue around how exactly the Border would work is only something we would continence once it becomes a reality.

Some countries have no legislation done and I am not sure the British will have the legislation done on time but we will.  The heads have been published and the Bill will be published on 22 February.  If we can publish it any sooner than that, we certainly will do so.  It is simpler than Members may think and I am not sure what background information there is to publish.  What the officials did was go through all the different areas where legislation may be required and they came up with 17 different areas where we would require primary legislation and then other areas where we will require secondary legislation.  Members have that information on the different areas such as healthcare, business, communications and so on.  I do not need to go through them because the heads have been published.<\/p>  <p>  On the procedure, as indicated when I met the party leaders last week, we will consult with the Opposition on the appropriate procedure.  I heard some support in the House for taking this legislation in a committee of the House.  That makes sense to me because it means the lead Minister, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, can be there and the line Minister can also be there.  Splitting it up into nine different committees or having Ministers coming in and out of the same committee would be unworkable.

I would be happy to have those conversations again, either at the level of Whip or at party leader level.<\/p>  <p>  On the fiscal impact, the Department of Finance's projections in the event of a no-deal hard Brexit were not published sooner because they were only finalised last week and they had to go to Cabinet first.  I would say that the Central Bank projections are similar, with the Department of Finance's projections being a little bit more optimistic.  However, the ESRI and Copenhagen Economics projections were much more optimistic than the Department of Finance's ones.  The difficulty with economic and fiscal forecasts is that they are just forecasts and nobody knows for sure what impact a hard Brexit with no deal would have on Ireland.  We do not know how much it would affect consumer confidence, for example, and at what level tariffs would be imposed by the UK, if at all.  These are assumptions but we have to build our budget and we have to operate on assumptions and these are our revised assumptions.<\/p>  <p>  The public finances indicate that rather than having a small surplus in 2019, the budget will go back into a deficit of about 0.2% of GDP, that the deficit would rise to 0.5% of GDP in 2020, that it would rise again in 2021 and that we would then go back into surplus in 2022.  In many ways, it proves the position that the Government took around budget time to be correct.

That means we will not have a return to recession or to austerity measures in the event of a no-deal hard Brexit.

The judgment call is to be made by the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as to when those conditions exist.  My judgment, which I know is shared by many in this House, is that mixing the issue of Irish unity with trying to secure a deal on Brexit is unwise.  Some of the unionist voices who have been opposed to a deal on Brexit are concerned that some Members of this House or some political forces may be trying to exploit Brexit to bring about Irish unity.  That is not the Government's agenda, that is not what we are doing at all and we do not want to threaten anyone's loyalty or identity.  We want to deliver an agreement that avoids a hard border, that gives us a transition period and that secures free trade between Britain and Ireland.  The issue of Irish unity at some point in the future is a separate one and should be dealt with at some point in the future and not mixed up in these Brexit negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900020#S01700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1548779700,"counter":233,"content":"<p>We will move onto Question No. 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900020#S01800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1548779700,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Can the Taoiseach address my question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900020#S01900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1548779700,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900020#S02000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1548779700,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I asked a specific question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900020#S02100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1548779700,"counter":237,"content":"<p>There are seven more specific questions.

Significant work is under way across each of the areas covered by the committee through Government Departments and agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups, such as the climate action high level steering group and the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  In addition, these matters are regularly considered at meetings of Government and in bilateral meetings with the Ministers responsible for the issues.<\/p>  <p>  Good progress is being made on the delivery of Project Ireland 2040.  Through the national planning framework, it sets out our strategic 20 year vision for Ireland's future, balancing rural and urban development and links it with the capital investment of &euro;116 billion over ten years to meet the infrastructure needs of our growing population.  The four funds launched under Project Ireland 2040 have a total of &euro;4 billion to invest across the areas of rural and urban regeneration and development, climate action, and disruptive technologies innovation.  The first round of funding allocations under these funds, amounting to &euro;276 million, was announced late last year.  These funds will leverage further private sector investment in innovative and targeted projects that deliver on the aims of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040, was established on an interim basis in September and is working to ensure the optimum management of State land through strategic development and regeneration, with an immediate focus on delivering homes, including social and affordable housing.  Housing continues to be a priority for the Government and we have seen strong growth in housing completions and in leading indicators, such as planning permissions, commencement notices, and housing registrations.  There has also been a strong delivery of publicly funded social housing in 2018, and the finalised figures will be published by the Minister in the next few weeks.  We are very aware of the significant challenge in meeting housing demand and tackling the ongoing issues in the housing market.  For this reason, budget 2019 provided an increase of 25% in the total housing budget, bringing it to &euro;2.3 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Delivering on our EU 2030 climate commitments and our objective to transition to a competitive, low carbon, sustainable economy by 2050 are also core priorities of Government.  We are investing &euro;22 billion in climate action through the national development plan to ensure our future growth is regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 provides for a range of provisions to lower carbon emissions and to improve sustainability, including more than &euro;200 million for agri-environmental actions to the rural development programme and more than &euro;164 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is currently preparing an all-of-Government action plan on climate disruption and is working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives in electricity, transport, agriculture, heating and other relevant sectors.

As he was forced to admit last month and as the Joint Committee on Health has heard, there has been what has been described as a catastrophe cost overrun on the children's hospital and on the costs that were provided by the Taoiseach as Minister for Health at that time and in the NDP which he launched only a year ago.  On a series of occasions he has attempted to downplay the impact of the overrun, as Deputy Howlin has said.  The Taoiseach has been suggesting there will be a benign reprofiling of the implications in later years so we should not be too bothered about it, but that is not sustainable.  It suggests he is desperate not to admit the impact of what has happened on the many projects he has launched.  We need to consider the impact of the &euro;1 billion extra that will be required.

He spent hours last year defending his marketing unit on the basis of the need for the public to know what the Government was planning.  If these plans change and if there has been an impact on them, surely the public deserve to know.  It seems that on one project alone the NDP is way out of kilter in contrast to what was originally suggested would be the cost.  I have always described many of the projects in the NDP as a bit fanciful.  I know of one hospital that was included because the Minister rang up and asked people to put a proposal together because if they did not get it into the NDP it would not be considered.

Did anybody bother to look at the rotten record of BAM, which got it and was &euro;120 million lower than the nearest other bid.  That should have raised alarm bells.  It built car parks in Holland that collapsed.  It had to make settlements with Cambridgeshire County Council over massive overruns on road projects.  It built the Ballyfermot Leisure Centre on which there was a significant overrun and it had a five-year long battle with the council about who would pick up the tab for the overrun. <\/p><p>There were also significant overruns in the Port of Cork.  Did anybody bother looking into Mr. Costello's record on a project board?  He was involved with significant overruns when working for Sisk in Poland and these nearly led the company to collapse.  Is it any wonder he stated that there was no problem with BAM's tender because he had a record of it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900021#T00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548780900,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I do not think there is any doubt that one of the greatest scandals of this Administration's term is the overrun relating to the children's hospital.  People are scandalised by it and how the figures have moved in this extraordinary way.  Does the Taoiseach have an upper limit regarding what the hospital is going to cost?  Hospitals are often broadly priced in the context of the cost per room.  Some years ago, it may have been &euro;1 million per room.  Allowing for inflation, if we increased that by 100% to &euro;2 million per room, we would have a cost of approximately &euro;800 million, which is consistent with figures from around the world.

We all want to see the hospital built.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach, who is my constituency colleague, knows, I made it clear that I favoured a greenfield site for the hospital somewhere along the M50, with easy access that would not give rise to the costs associated with the site that was eventually chosen by the then Minister for Health.  That is all in the past.  We now have a project in respect of which the costs increase daily.  Has the Taoiseach washed his hands of the matter?  He was Minister for Health so he is intimately familiar with it.  Has he placed an upper limit on what will be the cost?

The good relationships that have been built up, particularly over the past 20 years, need to be used now to find sensible ways forward for the sake of Northern Ireland in finding a way to create a context by which devolved government can function again and be re-established.  To do this, we are using the elements of the Good Friday Agreement that are relevant not only for east-west relations but also for interaction on North-South co-operation.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have had a number of meetings of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which have been good.  Through this forum we will have another meeting in a couple of months which will confirm new relationship structures between Britain and Ireland for a post-Brexit environment.  We will also plan for at least an annual meeting of both governments led by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister but involving many other Ministers as well.  The kind of structural relationship that France and Germany or Spain and Portugal have, for example, is one we want to see in the future to build on other structures that exist through the Good Friday Agreement.  We must recognise, however, that Ministers will unfortunately not meet one another regularly in Brussels or Luxembourg and work together on EU projects in the future in the way that they have done over the past 45 years or so.<\/p>  <p>  The personal relationships are good.

This is despite the fact that the British Parliament has not yet ratified the agreements to which its own government signed up a number of months ago and the fact that, unfortunately, the need for the reassurance mechanism that it is for so many people has not been the focus of the debate on the backstop in Westminster.

The central case scenario assumes the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as a transition period and a future relationship between the EU and the UK based on a free trade agreement.<\/p><p> Since July 2018, the Government has made a number of key decisions on Brexit preparedness including on staffing, ICT and infrastructure at ports and airports.  At its meeting on 11 December, the Government agreed that, while work on Brexit preparedness for the central-case scenario should continue, in light of ongoing political uncertainties and the Brexit deadline of 29 March, greater immediate priority must now be given to preparations for a no-deal Brexit.  Following this, the Government\u00a0published its Brexit contingency plan on 19 December 2018, which set out detailed sectoral analyses - 20 different sectors were examined - and approaches to mitigating the impacts of a no-deal Brexit.  Ireland's action plan is consistent with, and complementary to, the approach being taken at EU 27 level to prepare for the UK's withdrawal.  On 15 January, further discussions at Cabinet took this work forward in the important areas of transport connectivity and medicines, with memos brought to Government by the Ministers, Deputy Ross and Deputy Harris.<\/p> <p> A number of the\u00a0actions identified in a no-deal scenario will still be required even in a central-case scenario but with a longer timeframe for implementation.  While ratification of the withdrawal agreement is still the Government's preferred outcome, last week the Government published the general scheme of the proposed primary legislative measures required in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \u00a0We published the heads of the omnibus Bill, which has 17 parts.

In addition to the hazards of war, many have difficulties in accessing food and healthcare\u00a0due\u00a0to insecurity and\u00a0poor humanitarian access.  Millions of others are unable to pay for food and medical care even when it is available due to the collapse of the economy under the strains of conflict.  This crisis in Yemen is a matter of grave concern and a solution is urgently required. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The United Nations plays an absolutely critical role in working towards a political solution to\u00a0this conflict.  Ireland and the EU regard the appointment of Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in March 2018 as a very positive move.  Mr. Griffiths has worked tirelessly to bring the parties together, with EU support.  At the very end of 2018, his efforts bore some fruit with the holding of talks in Stockholm between the Yemeni parties.  This meeting was the first time in two and a half years that both the Government of Yemen and the Houthi leaders came together to promote the interests of the Yemeni people.  However, this is only the beginning of what may prove to be a long and painstaking process.  It is expected that the next round of talks will take place in the region.  Their success will be dependent on progress made since December\u00a0and in that regard implementation of the agreements reached in Stockholm will be crucial.\u00a0  In December agreement was reached\u00a0on the basis for a ceasefire and troop redeployment in the port city of Hudaydah, the key point of entry in Yemen for the majority of food, medicine and aid.  The ceasefire is fragile and both sides have accused the other of breaches but notwithstanding that, it is holding for the most part.  <\/p>  <p>  What is needed now is time to allow the agreements to be implemented and space to allow the UN sponsored talks to continue.  However, that does not mean that we sit back and do nothing.  The UN Secretary General has urged the international community to sustain pressure on both parties as they work together to implement the Stockholm agreement.  Careful diplomacy is required to ensure we achieve the best end result for the people of Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed the situation in Yemen at the EU Foreign Affairs Council last week.  The UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths has thanked the EU for its support, saying it would not have been possible to reach agreement in Stockholm without it, including reaching out to Iran.  However, as my Swedish colleague confirmed to me, what was agreed at Stockholm is fragile and needs EU support to move forward.  Therefore, despite these hopeful steps, we should be under no illusion as to the gravity of the situation.  After almost four years of conflict, the humanitarian situation on the ground remains dire, with a devastated economy and an almost complete collapse in basic public services exacerbating the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  The UN has a crucial role to play\u00a0in co-ordinating the delivery of assistance.  The UN reports that the gravity of the humanitarian situation in Yemen is exacerbated by the underlying poverty of the country.  Even when there is food in shops, people are often unable to afford it.  Humanitarian access is also a critical issue and access across Yemen deteriorated significantly in 2018, both in Government and Houthi-controlled areas.  Security issues, bureaucratic impediments and delays to humanitarian movements continue to interfere with humanitarian responses.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of humanitarian funding, Ireland has provided almost &euro;17.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015.  This includes a contribution of &euro;5 million to the UN Yemen humanitarian fund in 2018, which provides assistance in areas such as education, logistics, food security, nutrition and health.  We plan to make a similar &euro;5 million contribution to the humanitarian fund in 2019.  The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s direct assistance in 2018 was channelled through the UN humanitarian fund for Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and Saudi Arabia have a significant economic relationship but our trade partnership does not prevent us from raising human rights concerns through the most appropriate and effective channels.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy has always been based, above all, on the resolution of conflict by dialogue.  In many cases, continuing our trading relationships and building on our close ties allows us greater access to key interlocutors who can be influential on foreign policy decisions.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of an arms embargo, I am aware that some EU\u00a0member states which have arms industries have decided to halt arms exports for the present to countries involved in the conflict in Yemen.  A decision at EU level for a full arms embargo on any country would require the agreement of all EU member states but there is currently no consensus at EU level on an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia or any member of the coalition.  However, all EU member states have signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty.  This treaty exists to ensure that arms sales\u00a0do not fuel conflicts and to prevent arms\u00a0from falling into the hands of non-state actors or terrorists.  Ireland&rsquo;s efforts are concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of that treaty.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern on this issue.  The scale of need on the ground cannot be overstated.  While Ireland is contributing what we can to the humanitarian effort, we must continue to push for a lasting political solution that will address the conflict at the heart of this extraordinary human suffering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900027#Z01400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1548783900,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Our concern and our stern words have not altered the fact that millions of Yemenis are in danger of death by starvation.

Famine is not a side effect but a deliberate tactic by Saudi Arabia.  This is an orchestrated situation.  We know, from evidence given, that Yemen's geography is such that to destroy its farmland is something that one must go out of one's way to do.  It does not happen by accident.  The fact that hundreds of Yemeni fishing boats have been shot to pieces by machine gun fire from Saudi helicopters is not a coincidence.  It has to be organised.  The blockade of Hudaydah was calculated and organised because it is the only port in Yemen capable of bringing in food supplies from abroad through the overseas humanitarian aid programme.

There are nine Departments involved in contributing to the legislation, including the Department of the Taoiseach.  Essentially, there will be 17 pieces of legislation in one omnibus Bill.  We hope to publish the Bill on 22 February.  The legal draftspeople are working overtime to try to get it done.  We have given them the heads of the Bills from each of the nine Departments.  What this is about is legislating for a worst case scenario where the UK leaves the EU without a deal, without proper contingency planning and without a transition period, which is what everybody wants to create the time and space to be able to put permanent solutions in place.  In that scenario we must protect our own citizens in a practical way.<\/p>  <p>  We must make sure that trains can continue to travel between Dublin and Belfast under a new environment because they will be travelling out of the EU into a third country and back in again.  We must ensure that British students can continue to come to Irish universities in the way that they do today and that Irish students can continue to go to British universities and get the kind of financial supports that they get today.  We must continue to ensure that children in Belfast who are being brought to Dublin for specialist paediatric care can continue to do that in a way that is catered for in law, and that in the same way the many patients from Donegal who go across the Border into Altnagelvin hospital will get the same kind of treatments.  We must ensure that people in Ireland who get pensions that are paid for by the British Government, and people who get pensions in the UK that are paid for by the Government continue to be able to hold onto their incomes in a way that is seamless after 29 March.  There are lots of practical areas to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Secondary legislation is also required to deal with issues such as the recognition of a British driver's licence in Ireland.

We have paid particular attention to the questions of administrative detention, treatment of minors and the increasing use of prosecutions to suppress legitimate protest.  Ireland also provides funding to the Palestinian NGO, Addameer, which monitors and works on prisoner issues.  We have also raised some of these issues internationally, including at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  Of course, my officials do not, and cannot, follow up every allegation of mistreatment received.  The incident referred to was a large-scale search of the prison for contraband material.  Little is known about it in detail, although I am aware of allegations of mistreatment.  I know that Deputies have seen the same material, which was circulated by the Palestinian mission. <\/p>  <p>  It has been reported that Israeli authorities have consciously decided to introduce a tougher regime in the prisons in recent weeks, including restricted conditions for prisoners and ending the separation of prisoners from opposing factions.  I have no basis as yet to comment on this or on the specific allegations referred to by the Deputy.  Prison searches and other measures are not unknown in other jurisdictions.  However, I have not seen any security or practical rationale for such a change in policy, or any reference to similar changes being applied to Israelis who are imprisoned.  Issues to do with prisoners are always sensitive for both Israelis and Palestinians, and for obvious reasons they have the potential to have a wider political impact outside the prisons.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also acutely conscious that similar and indeed worse criticisms could be levelled at prison conditions in many Middle Eastern countries.

However, there is a Revenue concession which allows a zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements such as vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  The practice of zero rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT in November 1972 when the marketplace for food supplements was small and the concession meant that vitamins, minerals and fish oil supplements were treated the same as food for VAT purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Since the 1970s, there has been significant growth in the number and complexity of food supplement products on the market, most of which are not covered by the zero rate concession such as supplements containing botanicals and bioactive substances.  While these new products apply at the standard rate of VAT, the growing variety of products on the market led to diverging views between Revenue and the industry over which food supplement should be at the zero rate versus the 23%.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue issued ebriefs in 2011 and 2013 in an effort to clarify that only basic vitamins, minerals and fish oil would qualify for the zero rate but disagreement on the applicable VAT rate and queries on specific products continued.  <\/p>  <p>  The operation of the current concession has become problematic because of the efforts by some in the industry to exploit the concession to extend the zero rating beyond the scope permitted by Revenue.  Some businesses have challenged Revenue guidance and Revenue decisions on the VAT rating of products, giving rise to concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The issue was raised during the debates on the recent Finance Bill.  Deputies and Senators looked for clarity for industry on the VAT treatment of food supplements and sought the retention of the zero rate for certain categories of food supplements.<\/p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, the Minister agreed that he would ask his officials to address the matter in the context of the next Tax Strategy Group and stated that he would not interfere in any decision made by Revenue on the matter in the interim.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue published new guidance on 27 December concerning the rate of VAT that applies to food supplements, announcing its intention to apply the 23% VAT rate to most food supplements with effect from 1 March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Association, will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  It is possible to retain these products at the zero rate because they qualify as oral medicines, which are charged to VAT at the zero rate in Ireland under an historical derogation to EU VAT law.<\/p>  <p>  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of industry in regard to this matter.

A lot of people were beeping indicating their support for the strike.  I can report back that the paramedics who are organised in SIPTU refused to cross the picket line and the strike was incredibly successful.  If the Government does not know, I can tell it that the paramedics gave reports of the kind of difficult working conditions that they face.

Without the Government wishing to give itself more grief on the question of the health service, this dispute could be ended simply and without costing anyone a penny, except for the paramedics and ambulance drivers themselves because then they could properly pay their union dues.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE deducted union dues from members of NASRA for seven years.  NASRA has between 500 and 600 members out of a total of 1,300 paramedics.  Approximately 50% of the membership of the paramedic services and the NAS are members of NASRA and, for seven years, the HSE formally recognised them by deducting their fees and then last year it stopped taking deductions at source from any new members who joined NASRA.  The Minister of State knows exactly what I am referring to, being a long in the tooth trade unionist like myself.  Then in August it ceased all NASRA deductions.  The HSE has provoked and manipulated the situation and it has goaded these workers into a dispute because it is refusing to deal with them.  The HSE suspended four of its members in Cork last week who refused to work for a continuous 20 hours because they said it would have been contrary to their health and safety.

It is their decision and their right.  In a liberal Government that talks a lot about choice and moving forward and all the rest of it, the very least it could do is give these workers a right to be recognised and join the trade union of their choice, not the Minister of State's choice nor mine.

The HSE was advised that full emergency cover would be provided during the action.  This meant that all emergency calls would be responded to.  In addition, the NAS put robust contingency arrangements in place to provide additional emergency cover.  The Defence Forces were also on standby, if required.  The intention was to minimise any disruption and to ensure that patient safety was not compromised.  The service responded to more than 600 calls by 5 p.m.  These included a number of hospital transfers, more than 70 intermediate care calls and two helicopter call-outs.  There were 12 calls involving Army personnel.  The situation was closely monitored by NAS management until 8 p.m.  The service confirmed that there was no negative impact on its ability to provide patient care and service delivery.  This was due to the implementation of its contingency plan.<\/p>  <p>  The PNA states that its industrial action is in connection with the following: a dispute over the automated deduction of union subscriptions from member's pay - the HSE is refusing to facilitate payroll deductions at source of union subscriptions to NASRA, as it does not recognise NASRA; and refusal by the HSE to engage in negotiations with the PNA or to recognise the PNA as union representatives when representing its ambulance personnel members.<\/p>  <p>   It is important to again state the factual position on this dispute.  NASRA, which is affiliated with the PNA, is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights.  The PNA also does not have negotiating rights on behalf of ambulance personnel.  The legal position is clear.  The HSE and the NAS have no obligation to recognise NASRA or the PNA for ambulance personnel.  The PNA, which is a non-Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, affiliated union, has negotiating rights for nurses working in the psychiatry and intellectual disability sectors.  The main union recognised by the HSE for ambulance front-line grades is SIPTU.  F&oacute;rsa and UNITE also represent ambulance grades.  The HSE deducts subscriptions at source for ambulance staff who are members of SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and UNITE.  This is consistent with the fact that these are the unions recognised as representing ambulance grades.  The HSE does not carry out deductions for subscriptions to NASRA, as it is not recognised.  Facilitating deductions at source is not a legal right, rather it is a concession granted to recognised unions.  As far as the Government is concerned, there are sufficient unions available to ambulance staff and it does not intend to recognise this group.  Of course, individuals have a right to membership of any trade union.  However, they do not have a right that such membership is facilitated or recognised by their employer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900034#GG00500","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1548788100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>That is a scandalous answer from the Minister of State on behalf of the Government.

The workers decided that their membership of SIPTU was not sufficient and they set up NASRA.  That is their right.  It is not 350 but 500 of them who are in NASRA and it is outrageous that a public sector employer would not negotiate or deal with the union of choice of its workers.  It is absolutely scandalous and what message does it send to employers such as Lloyds Bank, Tesco, etc.?  It sends a message that the Government will actively encourage the kind of union busting, derecognition tactics that are ongoing.  It is scandalous and anyone who would call him or herself a trade unionist and would participate in a Government that would stand over such a line is making a big mistake.  The HSE is making a big mistake.  It is opening up and it will be faced with two different fronts where it is taking on the nurses on the one hand while, on the other, NASRA would be absolutely correct to take further action.<\/p><p>The Minister of State's response is full of holes and spin.  Ministers spend much time on spin.  More than 500 members of NASRA are in the paramedic and ambulance service.

However, new members have been joining because they are not happy with their current representation.  The fact that the number involved is only 350 odd has nothing to do with the discussion.

The Save Our Acute Hospitals Services Committee and Oireachtas Members met hospital management and HSE officials last Friday week.  While I am satisfied that the construction of the unit will be completed later this year, we were given information that has given rise to serious concerns to the effect that the HSE is not committed to the opening of the unit when it is ready.  We were advised that no funding allocation has been made for staffing despite business cases - at a total cost of &euro;7 million - being last June.

This means that the hospitals serving Tipperary are the most crowded in the country.  This cannot be tolerated much longer by the people of our county.  When the modular unit is ready in July, it must be staffed and made operational immediately.<\/p>  <p>  The overcrowding at South Tipperary General Hospital does not exist in a vacuum.

Deputy Lowry announced that the unit would be open in the winter of 2016, then in the winter of 2017 and then in the winter of 2018.  We are promised it will be open this year but I do not believe it.  The modular unit to be brought to Clonmel seems to be abandoned.  It would be something if we could get it built, which I hope we do, but no money has been allocated to staff it.  We are not allowed to recruit staff for it.

Hospitals are increasingly operating at or above capacity, with year-round demand pressures that are further challenged over the winter months.  Approximately 1.3 million people attended emergency departments last year.  South Tipperary General Hospital, as a model 3 hospital, is experiencing similar challenges to similar facilities.  In 2018, over 30,000 patients attended the emergency department at South Tipperary General Hospital - a 1.7% reduction on 2017; 9,149 patients were admitted - a 6.5% increase on 2017; and, as a result, the number of patients recorded as waiting on trolleys at 8 a.m. was 3,739 - an increase of 3.1% compared to 2017.<\/p><p>  The health service capacity review indicates that Ireland has among the highest acute bed occupancy rates in the developed world at 94%, significantly ahead of the OECD average of 77%.  It is against this background that the review recommended an increase in acute hospitals beds of over 2,600 by 2031 to support the projected Increase in demand for services in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  The national development plan provides for the full 2,600 beds by 2028 - three years ahead of schedule.  As a result, increasing capacity is a priority for the Government.  Over the past 12 months, an additional 240 beds have been opened.  A capacity programme for 2019 has been agreed and is set out in the national service plan for 2019.  This includes: 75 acute beds and 70 community beds to come on stream in 2019 as part of the winter plan for 2018-2019; 78 additional beds planned for quarters 1 and 2 of 2019, including the 40-bed modular build in South Tipperary General Hospital; and preparation of 202 beds, of which 16 are critical care, by quarter 4 of 2019, with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in the first quarter of 2020.<\/p><p>  On foot of budget 2019 and the national service plan, the necessary funding is in place for the 40-bed modular build for South Tipperary General Hospital.  This includes: funding to complete the construction; funding for equipment in the unit; and funding to staff the unit.  The HSE is planning for the unit to be operational in the second quarter of this year.<\/p><p>  Increasing capacity alone will not address the challenges faced by the health system.  Investment and reform must go hand in hand.  We have seen in other hospitals in recent years that increased capacity coupled with an ambitious reform programme will deliver improved access for patients.  That is why driving improvement processes in line with Sl&aacute;intecare is a key objective of the Government to ensure that investment is coupled with reform.<\/p><p>I look forward to the completion of this new unit as it represents a significant investment in bed capacity in South Tipperary General Hospital.  It will complement the existing 178 inpatient beds and 21 day beds and will support the provision of acute hospital services to the geographically wide catchment area of south Tipperary, west Waterford and varying areas of north Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900035#HH01100","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548789300,"counter":490,"content":"<p>We are getting the usual spin from the Minister of State.

It is not just about my constituency, the inner city or Dublin Airport but the entire city.  MetroLink is a project which is warranted and required by the city and will be seen in the future.  We believe that the issues occurring on the south side relating to route selection will delay this project.  The project is 45 years in the making.  It was first suggested by Forf&aacute;s in 1974 and if it was not for the economic collapse, it would probably have started by now.  We have rough agreement on the proposed route alignment.

It will perhaps be 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  The construction of this project is scheduled to take five years so we need to get moving on it as quickly as possible.  That is why both Deputy Rock and I believe that the project should be separated at St. Stephen's Green and the components which have already broadly been agreed can be delivered on in the coming years.  That will require the National Transport Authority, NTA, to expedite its application for a railway order and get this project up and running.  It is clear, given the extraordinary growth at Dublin Airport, which had 31 million passengers last year, with the second runway and the project for 50 million passengers in the next two decades, that it will require additional transport infrastructure to take the cars off the M50 and put passengers on trains and buses so they can go to the city centre and hop on the metro to get there in just 19 minutes.

It should be the concern of the entire city because unless we get the shovels in the ground for the metro project, this promise will remain unfulfilled.  As it stands, north side communities, such as Ballymun, Santry and Swords in Deputy Farrell's constituency, and the airport are still under-served by public transport.  Some 30 million passengers go through the airport, with 10 million tourists coming into our country, all of which are great numbers for the Minister's Department, and they are a credit to him.  A real credit to him would be to see a legacy project such as this get a shovel in the ground immediately.

If this slips further, does the Minister simply intend to watch the NTA push these timelines indefinitely into the future?<\/p><p>Accordingly, I would like a commitment from the Minister to at least discuss with the NTA the idea of separating this project into a first phase and a second phase, with phase 1 being the north side to the city centre, or Swords to the city centre - effectively, the original metro north - and phase 2 being the city centre to perhaps Sandyford, perhaps elsewhere.  This possibility should at least be explored now, while we have time, the capital infrastructure budget and Project Ireland 2040 is proceeding, to get those shovels into the ground and get this project moving forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900036#JJ03900","speaker":"1304","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548789900,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to address this matter in the House.  I appreciate their concerns for their own areas and their wish to see delivery of what will be a superb piece of infrastructure, not just for their constituencies, but for the entire city and, indeed, the entire country.  Ironically, during last year's consultation on the emerging preferred route for MetroLink, northside issues initially dominated the headlines, and I do not recall southside Deputies at the time calling for the northside to be bypassed.  In seriousness, though, I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the development of the MetroLink project.<\/p>  <p>  As we are all aware, the national development plan, NDP, which was launched last year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, included the proposed development of MetroLink, linking Sandyford in south Dublin with Swords in north Dublin.  There is a long history of a proposed north-south metro service in the Dublin area, with references to be found in the then Dublin Transportation Office's A Platform for Change document in 2000 and even before that.  A project known as metro north was granted planning permission just as the economic and financial crisis hit.  The current statutory transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, published in 2016, stated its objective to provide for a new metro north reaching from the city centre to Swords via the airport.  It also stated its objective to provide for a metro south, which would extend southwards the new metro north and, importantly, a long-term, sustainable solution to the capacity issues inherent in the capability of a Luas-type service to operate along the green line into the medium and long term.  In developing proposals for the national planning framework, NPF, and the NDP, the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, combined these metro projects into MetroLink.  Both the NPF and the NDP indicate Government's policy support for the development of this type of solution to both medium- and long-term public transport issues.<\/p>  <p>  A metro service will provide a high-capacity, high-frequency corridor linking critical destinations across the city such as Swords, the airport, DCU, Ballymun and the city centre and all along the existing green line corridor.  It will offer high-quality interchange with the commuter rail network and with our improved bus network, which will be delivered under BusConnects in the years ahead.  It is because of all these fantastic advantages that I can understand the Deputies' wish for MetroLink to progress in their areas first and foremost.  I have no doubt but that they made these very points as part of the public consultation process which took place last year on the emerging preferred route.  Since then, the NTA and TII have been considering the thousands of submissions received with a view to developing what will be known as the preferred route.  I am happy to inform the House that a further round of public consultation will take place shortly on this \"preferred route\".  The preferred route will reflect the NTA's and TII's consideration of the issues raised during the extensive consultations held so far and allow members of the public to express their views again on the proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies can understand that it would be wholly inappropriate for me to comment on particular route alignments while work by the relevant statutory agencies is under way.  I encourage the Deputies to engage with the public consultation process when it opens again shortly.  We are at an exciting time in shaping public transport for the years and decades to come as we deliver upon the ambition of the NPF and the NDP.  I would like to think all of us in this House can agree that we need to improve continually our public transport system and support Government's efforts in this regard, as outlined under the NPF and NDP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900037#KK00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1548789900,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response, although, with respect, we did not ask him to intervene in the route alignment.  He is quite right that no southside Deputies involved themselves in the route alignment issue on the northside, but this was primarily because it was so quickly resolved.  My sincerely held view is that this project will be delayed for perhaps a year because of the ongoing consultation process on the southside.  This is not about my constituency, Deputy Rock's constituency or the constituency of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who has joined us.  It is about providing 10 million tourists with the opportunity to avoid our road system, which is a nightmare at the best of times.  It is about encouraging investment in the corridors towards Dublin city centre and out towards the north county, where we have an abundance of developable lands for industry and housing and other ancillary tourist attractions.  This is not about constituency politics at all; it is about a critical piece of national infrastructure being delivered on time, as the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, announced at Heuston Station in November 2015.  I was there with him and was delighted to see the project start up at that point, but it has slipped.  I do not want to see it slip any further.  That is the purpose of this debate.

First and foremost, it is not about our constituencies; it is about the city and national infrastructure and delivering on it.  We both engaged in the public consultation process - in fact, thousands of my constituents did so - and we were promised an outcome from that process last year.  Last year slipped to this year; this year slipped to February; February, as of my latest discussion with the NTA yesterday, is now slipping to March, one year since the public consultation opened.  The Minister suggested in his answer that we should engage in public consultation when it next opens.  I would love to engage with the next stage of the public consultation but I cannot do so as it has been delayed indefinitely.  That is a concern.  My concern is the constant slippage and the battle now being played out via media on the southside of the city, in particular.  My other concern is that the reality behind the scenes is that the NTA does not seem to have a ready-made solution for this problem.  Unlike the problem on the northside to which the Minister alluded, and to which a solution was found quickly, this issue does not seem to be reaching a resolution quickly.  A solution needs to be found quickly, and the best way of doing so is an instruction to split this into a first phase and a second phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900037#KK00800","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1548789900,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I absolutely accept the points made by both Deputies.  I presume it is just a coincidence that they want to divide the project into a north phase and a south phase and start with the north phase and that they just happen to represent northside constituencies.  These things happen from time to time, and coincidences are not unusual in politics.  I accept their points but I would say as a southsider that there are special problems on the southside as well.  Both Deputies alluded to the airport as being very crowded and seeing a huge demand from passengers coming into and out of the city and into St. Stephen's Green.  I am sure they will be aware, however, that on the southside there is also chronic overcrowding on public transport from time to time due to the bulge in population there.  Both sides of the city have equal cause and equal right to a voice and to put their case for getting the MetroLink more quickly than the other.  The reason it was called MetroLink, I think, was to ensure there was not this north-south divide and that this magnificent piece of infrastructure went ahead in tandem and in accordance with the wishes of the NTA.  I will not interfere with the proposed route or in the day-to-day activities of the NTA but I will relate to the authority the views of both Deputies, their bias for the northside and their preference for the project to start there.

She was taking the House through the different sections of the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 1 is a straightforward definitions section.<\/p><p>Section 2 sets out that the &quot;National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund&quot; will be established on its commencement and that the fund's purpose is to hold assets for purposes specified in section 9(2).<\/p><p>Section 3 places an &euro;8 billion cap on the value of assets and money that may be held in the fund but allows any return on the fund to be held in the fund.<\/p><p>In our current interest rate environment, we can expect a near zero return or a small carry cost for holding the fund as near cash.  However, the fund is unlikely to reach the &euro;8 billion cap for some years.  It is to be expected that the interest rate environment will normalise over that period.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides that the fund is to be managed and controlled by the Minister for Finance, and includes standard provisions on the keeping of accounts, audit formalities and laying of audited accounts before the Oireachtas.  In this regard, I want to clarify that my intention is to delegate my investment responsibilities in respect of the fund under this Bill to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, under section 28 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  This is an appropriate use of the operational expertise of the NTMA.<\/p> <p> Sections 5 and 6 relate to the transfer of assets to the fund.  I want to explain these provisions in a little bit more detail.  Section 5(1) requires the Minister, within 30 days of commencing the section, to transfer assets not exceeding &euro;2 billion in value to the fund from the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  I want to clarify that my intention remains, as set out in budget 2018 and budget 2019, that the transfer will be &euro;1.5 billion.  I have specified a higher maximum for two reasons: first, to allow for some headroom in case some of the transferred assets are non-cash and transpire to have a slightly higher realised value; and, second, to allow me to consider transferring a larger amount if there is a high degree of consensus that this should be done.  Section 5(2) sets out that in each year from 2019 to 2023, the Minister is to transfer &euro;500 million from the Central Fund to the national surplus (exceptional contingencies) fund.  This is subject to subsections (5) to (7), to which I will come shortly.<\/p> <p> This House has a function under subsection (4).  The D&aacute;il can pass a resolution authorising transfers to the fund.  This facility could be used to transfer additional money to the fund in a range of circumstances - for example, if there are windfall tax receipts, or similar one-off income to the Exchequer, or if we have a substantial budget surplus.  It might also be used to further augment the fund in the years after 2023.<\/p> <p> Subsections (5) to (7) create a form of in-year contingency reserve for then period from 2019 to 2023 when a payment of &euro;500 million will normally be due under subsection (2).  Those payments will generally be made towards the end of the year.  However, if there is a serious event during the year requiring substantial unanticipated expenditure, it will be possible to reduce the amount of the payment into the fund.  The type of event is deliberately not described in greater detail than &ldquo;a natural or other disaster&rdquo;.  I anticipate this contingency being activated if, for example, there is an exceptionally severe weather event.  It is not intended to substitute for prudent contingency budgeting by public authorities.  It is only for events that are inherently exceptional, or exceptionally repeated, in a given year.  That might arise if there are repeated storms, for example.  If this facility is used, any payment made will be directly from the Exchequer under the normal public financial procedures.  In addition, the Minister for Finance will make a report to the House, in accordance with subsection (7), as to the reasons for reducing the payment being made into the fund.<\/p> <p> Section 6 operates as an escape clause in the years from 2019 to 2023.  If, during that period, we move into substantial deficit, it clearly will not make sense to borrow money to put into the national surplus (exceptional contingencies) fund.  Section 6 is designed to deal with this.  It allows the Minister at the time to propose a type of negative financial resolution - specifically, a resolution authorising the Minister not to make the normal &euro;500 million payment.  If the D&aacute;il passes the resolution, then the payment will not be made in that year.<\/p> <p> Section 7 is a technical amendment to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act of 2014 to allow the Minister to direct the NTMA, as the custodian of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, to transfer assets out of it to another specified fund.<\/p> <p> Section 8 sets out the high-level investment strategy for the fund.  It is designed to be conservative and highly liquid.  The fund will most likely be held in cash deposits or in short-term investments that can readily be cashed in at no or minimal loss.  This is to ensure that if a crisis gives rise to an immediate funding requirement, the money will be available straight away.  There is a specific provision which is intended to address the sustained low-interest environment in which we currently find ourselves and in which deposits are actually attracting negative interest - that is, we are being charged to keep money on deposit.  Subsection (3) gives specific authority to consider the net Exchequer position in deciding where and how to invest the fund.  This is to take into account that if we are placing the fund on deposit in the Central Bank and are charged an interest rate for that which will, in due course, be remitted to the Exchequer.  This provision allows us to take a broad overview of the State&rsquo;s net position when determining how to invest the fund.  When I delegate my investment functions under this legislation to the NTMA, I will also be giving them investment guidelines based on the mandate set out in this section.<\/p> <p> Section 9 sets out the criteria for drawdown of the national surplus (exceptional contingencies) reserve fund.  It has a triple provision in place.  The Minister must be satisfied there are reasonable grounds for drawdown.  My Department is working on what those indicators might best be but I am reluctant to be strongly prescriptive within the Bill.  An economic crisis can be quite unpredictable in its effects and there is simply no point having the money available to mitigate a serious event but being unable to access it because a specific threshold or condition is not met.  However, a Minister must have reasonable grounds to believe that the proposal is necessary.  Those grounds could include a sharp and significant increase in unemployment or a dramatic fall-off in tax receipts.  The second element is that the Minister brings a memorandum to Government in the normal way in order to obtains its approval.  If Government gives its approval, the third and final element is that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann decides whether or not to approve that decision.  These kinds of decisions will take place under the full light of democratic scrutiny.<\/p> <p> There is a modification to this procedure set out in subsection (4).  If the Minister believes - again, based on reasonable grounds - that a payment to the Exchequer is urgently necessary before the next sitting of the D&aacute;il and the Government approves it, he or she may make the payment.  The Minister must then report to the D&aacute;il on the payment and the reasons for it at its next sitting.  I stress that this could arise only in situations such as a full-blown liquidity crisis in which normal State payments could not be made unless the money was transferred to the Exchequer.  Even in the darkest days of 2008 and 2009, it is likely that this threshold would not have been met.  I very much hope we never will need to use this provision, but I believe that it is useful to include it in the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 10 requires the Minister to comply with a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or the emergency Government decision and transfer the amount specified to the Exchequer.  I want to be clear: drawdown is only to the Exchequer.  A resolution cannot direct that the money go to any other place.  It will, of course, be possible to transfer money on from the Exchequer, depending on what is required.  Any such onward transfer will be subject to the full rigour of the public financial procedures and can be made only where this House consents to it by a further resolution.<\/p> <p> Section 11 is a fairly standard expenses provision.  However, I should explain that any expenses incurred in investing the fund will be chargeable on the fund.  Given the conservative nature of the investment mandate, I do not expect this to be a significant cost.<\/p> <p> Section 12 sets out the Short Title and includes a standard commencement provision.  I intend to commence this legislation later in the year if and when it has received Oireachtas approval and when the delegation order and investment guidelines are ready and the NTMA confirms to me that they are ready to make the transfer of money or assets from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.<\/p> <p> This is a robust Bill.  The fund that will be established as a result of its enactment can help in the future.  The Bill delivers on a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  It also delivers on my ongoing commitment to creating resilience in the future to deal with risks that are as yet unknown.<\/p> <p> I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900037#KK01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548791100,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I will share my time with Deputy Fleming.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill 2018 - it is quite a mouthful - or, what has become known as a rainy day fund.<\/p>  <p>  The events of recent months underline and reinforce the need for a fiscal buffer to be put in place.  It makes for very sound financial management for our country to plan for darker days that might lie ahead.  One can argue about the drawdown criteria, the methodology and how much is put into the fund but what is not arguable is the need for a country, in managing its public finances, to have a buffer in place so that when there is an economic shock and when exceptional circumstances arise in the future, we have a reserve at our disposal which can be used in that in such a circumstance.  The risks we face as a country at this time are very significant.  Many of the economic variables have been favourable for Ireland in recent years.  We have had tailwinds, in effect.  When one examines the interest rate environment our country has benefitted from, one sees there have been very low sovereign borrowing costs, which mean we have saved billions of euro compared with where we thought we would be now in terms of the costs of servicing the national debt.  The ECB's quantitative easing programme, or bond-buying programme as it has become known, is very favourable for Ireland in terms of the market conditions it helped to create.  As we look into the future there is great uncertainty about potential trade wars.  We have the rise of protectionism.  We have a very volatile situation in the United States.  There is a potential trade war there.  It already exists but could deteriorate even further in terms of its relationship with China.  The area of corporation tax and the boom in receipts which we are benefitting from at this time is very favourable for Ireland.  Receipts are now in excess of &euro;10 billion per annum, which is far ahead of where we could possibly have imagined a number of years ago.<\/p>  <p>  That is all before one even mentions Brexit, which the Minister outlined today.  The Minister published an initial assessment of what the impact of a disorderly Brexit with a hard deal or no deal would be on the Irish economy.  None of us in the House wants to see that but we have to accept that with just two months to go to 29 March, it is a very live possibility.  If it happens, it will have major ramifications for our country, economic performance, jobs, tax receipts and so on.  I welcome the fact the Minister today published an initial assessment.  There will be further details in February and further work will be unveiled as part of the stability programme update which we are required to submit to the European Commission by the end of April.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the debate on the Bill.  We first proposed a rainy day fund towards the end of 2015 because we saw at that time, and we continue to see, the need for a developed economy working in a cyclical economic environment to put away money for difficult days that may come in the future.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that while there will be a difference of emphasis in how such a fund is set up and how it is operated, a very wide range of international organisations support the establishment of a fiscal buffer, including the European Commission and the OECD.  The ECB has also spoken about it.  All the main international organisations we engage with, have a partnership with and work with on an ongoing basis, such as the IMF, have urged the Government to put a fiscal buffer in place.  It is important we make the start in doing it at this time.  <\/p>  <p>  There will be a debate about the criteria for triggering a drawdown.  Section 7 of the Bill deals with that issue.  It sets out that it would be in order to remedy or mitigate against an event of exceptional circumstances - that is, an unusual event outside the control of the State - that impacts on the financial position of the Government or a severe economic downturn, to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system and its continued stability or to support major structural reforms that have direct, long-term positive budgetary effects within the meaning of Article 5 of the Council regulation of 1997.  We will have an opportunity to go into the drawdown criteria in some more detail on Committee Stage.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to say in the event of it being suggested that Ireland could be in breach of fiscal rules if we draw down this fund, ultimately any sanction or decision to take proceedings against Ireland will be made by the European Commission on the advice of the European Council.  All those bodies recommend and endorse the strategy of setting up a fiscal buffer of this nature.  It will only be in exceptional circumstances that this money will have to be drawn down.  I do not envisage a circumstance in which our colleagues in Europe, who are advocating the establishment of such a fund, would punish us for drawing it down or for invoking the good example they have asked Ireland and other countries to set.  I do not envisage such a scenario.  However, the detail of it is something we can and will work through in the weeks ahead when we get into the section-by-section analysis of the Bill.    <\/p>  <p>  With regard to some of the specifics, there is a need for a debate on the cap of &euro;8 billion the Minister has provided for in the Bill.  The Minister has reiterated his intention is to transfer &euro;1.5 billion.  The legislation provides for up to &euro;2 billion but the Minister has clarified in his remarks this evening that his intention is to transfer &euro;1.5 billion followed by annual transfers of &euro;500 million.  A couple of years ago the intention was that it would be &euro;1 billion per annum and it is anticipated it will be &euro;500 million.  The Minister might elaborate further if he gets his chance in his closing remarks.  We will certainly revisit the issue on Committee Stage of why there is a need for a statutory cap of &euro;8 billion in terms of the quantum of the limit the Minister believes is appropriate for this fund.  <\/p>  <p>  The requirement for the fund to be highly liquid and to be retained in the form of cash or near cash will have consequences by way of the return or the cost of administering such a fund.  We need to work through the detail of whether there is a need for all the fund to be held in cash or near cash.  I do not think it does necessarily.  The likelihood of billions of euro having to be drawn down overnight is very unlikely.  It may well be more prudent in the form of managing the fund.  I am sure the Minister will take the advice of the NTMA, which will have delegated authority in this matter, that at least some of the fund could be put on longer term notice so there may be some return available for the fund to be delivered.  I urge the Minister to have a look at the report and the opinion of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the conclusions from December 2017.  I acknowledge there is further work to be done in the development of this framework but it is very important for our country at this time.  We do not know what we are facing in the next couple of months.  It may well be that in the most adverse of scenarios the need to establish this fund or our capacity to establish it could be severely impacted in the very short term.  I acknowledge that.  All this discussion is on the basis of the central scenario for Brexit, which Government has used as the basis of budget 2019.  We have to use it as the basis for this debate while acknowledging the direction may change and that it may need to change out of necessity depending on what happens in Westminster in the next couple of months.  On the basis of the central scenario, we need to proceed in a very careful and managed way in setting up a fiscal buffer which, I have no doubt, will prove to be exceptionally useful in time to come when exceptional circumstances visit our country again, as is inevitable at some point in time.  <\/p>  <p>  I will leave my remarks at that.  I look forward to Deputy Fleming's contribution and that of the other Members of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900039#MM00100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1548791700,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Second Stage of what I would call the rainy day fund Bill.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who proposed this in 2015.  It was included as part negotiations of the confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael in early 2016.  I am quite sure that had he not proposed that with the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party at that stage, it would not have been in the confidence and supply agreement and we would not be here today.<\/p><p>The technical name for this legislation is the National Surplus Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingency Bill 2018.  It will in time be known in layman's English as the rainy day fund.  It is very good that we are getting to this point.  Considerable pressure had to be put on the Government to get to this point.  It had to be dragged on different occasions.<\/p><p>There was a commitment to put &euro;1 billion per annum into the fund; the Government has rowed back on that substantially and the proposal now is for only half of that amount.  The Taoiseach proposed raiding the fund even before it was set up.  Given all the talk about this since the last general election, it has come as a surprise to many people that there is not a single bob in the fund yet.  The intention is I presume at least to put something into the fund by 31 December this year.  I know the legislation had to be set up, but we really took our time.  We would be in a better place if this fund had been operational at an earlier date.<\/p><p>That said, it is good it is happening now.  Items like this, which are not overly contentious, should be able to move through the House quickly.  I know that on Committee Stage, my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, will have positive and constructive amendments.  I ask the Minister to consider each to them carefully because they come from a genuine interest in the need for such a fund for whenever the rainy day might come.  Let us hope it does not come for many a long year.  However, if it comes, as sure as night follows day we need to have something in that fund.<\/p><p>This year things are somewhat clearer in that the ECB plan for quantitative easing is coming to an end.  That will put pressure on interest on the national debt which has been reducing dramatically in recent years.  We might see a slight increase in that as a result of the change in the ECB policy.  With so many unknown factors relating to Brexit, none of us can speculate tonight how that will work.  There are definitely risks attached to that, which is all the more reason for having a fund such as this.<\/p><p>Why is there an &euro;8 billion limit on the fund?  It should be open ended.  In some years with a surplus, there should be a case for putting in an additional amount.  Some time ago when we started the debate on this and corporation tax was yielding &euro;4.5 billion to &euro;5 billion per annum and it was then heading to &euro;6 billion, our side of the House proposed that a significant portion of anything more than &euro;6 billion in corporation tax, which was beyond our wildest dreams just a few years ago, should go into this fund.  However, the Government has not done that.  Because it suits up to ten major multinationals to pay a bit of tax in Ireland rather than a bigger amount somewhere else, the Government has got a this windfall tax.  It does not know precisely why we are getting it or why the companies are paying so much.  The Government is not able to anticipate it, but it is using that windfall tax to fund day-to-day expenditure in many Departments and especially in the health services.<\/p><p>The Government is running a severe risk in its prudential management of our receipts.  We are enjoying these windfall receipts from corporation tax now but next year or the following year it could as easily go some other way.  If some other country decides to have a more attractive regime for corporation tax than Ireland, those multinationals will just up sticks and move their corporate headquarters.  All of a sudden there would be a big hole in our finances and then we would be in almighty trouble with day-to-day funding.  Health services, educational services and social protection funding would be seriously compromised because the Government has not been prudent in its management up to now.<\/p><p>Years ago we had the old National Pension Reserve Fund which was great.  It provided a big buffer when it was called on.  We still have quite an investment in that fund.  Even though in some of those years the country was not as well off as we are now, the investment per annum was 1% of GNP, which probably would be closer to &euro;2 billion per annum now.  People might think that is unthinkable, but that is an example of a really ambitions plan.  The Government's proposal to put in &euro;500 million is a modest start and let us hope the figures increase.<\/p><p>Some Opposition parties have taken what I would call the lazy approach of getting all the money, spending it all and not investing anything into the future.  We need it now and I accept there is a crisis now.  However, the crisis is not due to lack of money; it is due to attitudes of Government to spending decisions, prioritisation, getting efficiency for the money we are actually spending and how it is spent.  We are not short of spending money at the moment.  There is an issue with where the Government is directing that spending and in particular ensuring that we get value for money for what we are spending.  While that is the job of the Government, it should not throw the additional corporation tax receipts that are coming in now into day-to-day funding of public services, albeit they are very important.<\/p><p>I know the Irish Strategic Investment Fund can invest up to &euro;2 billion.  The Minister has indicated he is putting in only &euro;1.5 billion.  He is being prudent; I would say excessively prudent.  He should try to invest the maximum amount in this fund.  I know it is being managed by the National Treasury Management Agency and it is good that it will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts for the moment anyway during this D&aacute;il for as long as it lasts, I believe that is a welcome development.  It is important to have public scrutiny of such a fund and a proper D&aacute;il debate on the use and investment of those funds every year.<\/p><p>I share the concerns of my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, over holding most of the fund in cash or near cash.  As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Connolly, will verify, the Committee of Public Accounts has seen many Departments coming in with a charge in their accounts for negative interest.  There was a time when a State organisation was able to earn interest on amounts that could be &euro;5 million, &euro;10 million or &euro;50 million.  Now they are being charged interest for putting it on deposit with the Central Bank or through the National Treasury Management Agency.  Leaving money as cash in a bank is a way of losing money.  We would probably pay many people millions of euro to advise us to do that and lose money.  We should not spend money on consultants to do a job that the NTMA is well capable of doing.<\/p><p>The D&aacute;il must give consent to extract money from this fund, which is very important.  The reasons have been set out there, but they are rather loose.  I would hope there will be strong D&aacute;il control on a Minister doing that or making a proposal.  It is proposed that he might be able to act to some extent even when the D&aacute;il is not sitting.  I do not think a Minister over a couple of weeks of a D&aacute;il recess could find himself in an emergency that he did not know about on the day the D&aacute;il broke up such that it would be necessary to give that extra power.  I am concerned when Ministers get extra power over payments through the Central Fund because it never comes back for discussion here in the D&aacute;il Chamber.<\/p><p>Regarding the Central Fund, all the payments for interest on the national debt are paid through the Central Fund.  They never come through the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach or any line committee as part of the Estimates.  They never come to the floor of the D&aacute;il for a debate.  I am not suggesting we should not pay the interest and pay back our national debt - there should be a debate here in the House every year - but when the Minister has discretion to do something without having to report to the D&aacute;il, that is the way things happen.  Also our payments of about &euro;2 billion to the European Union every year are never discussed <i>in toto<\/i>in this House or at any line committee.  Again it is paid through the Central Fund where a Minister has total discretion.  When a Minister has total discretion eventually over a period of time the D&aacute;il never gets to debate the matter.  That is why I do not believe a Minister should have that discretion.  Government is answerable to the D&aacute;il and any withdrawal from the fund should be approved by the D&aacute;il in advance and not noting it after the fact.<\/p><p>We support the Bill, which is long overdue.  We look forward to a detailed report coming back after Committee Stage.  Any suggestions coming from our side of the House will be positive and constructive and I hope the Minister will take them into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900040#NN00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548792300,"counter":544,"content":"<p>T&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in i gcoinne an Bhille seo.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposes this Bill.  The concept of a rainy day fund is one with which most people instinctively agree and if there was a proposal before us to establish a real rainy day fund, I would give it serious consideration but the truth is that we do not have such a proposal before us this evening.  A rainy day fund would be truly counter-cyclical in that it would remove money from the economy during times of growth, as this fund would do, but it would also allow that money to be re-injected as a recession hit or growth slowed.  That is where the crucial flaw in this legislation lies.  It lets us put away money but does not allow us to take it back out.<\/p>  <p>  We must also consider where our economy stands at this point in time.  The Government is asking us to support putting money away that could be used to build homes, open hospital wards, support new cr&egrave;che facilities where they are desperately needed as well as for many other areas.  The European Commission, the IMF and others have all pointed to the lack of infrastructure, especially housing, as representing a major threat to our economy.  In that context, we must ask if moving &euro;8 billion into a fund that cannot be reopened is the best use of money at this time or indeed, at any time.  This is a fund that cannot be spent tomorrow when times are bad and which reduces our capacity to catch up on infrastructure that is needed today.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also a very real question as to why this legislation explicitly opens the door to this fund becoming another bank bailout fund.  That is in black and white in the legislation before us.  It states very clearly that one of the criteria under which this fund can be accessed is for exactly that purpose, thus preventing potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and ensuring the continued stability of that system.  That is in black and white in the Bill in terms of one of the three criteria for using the fund.  This is about bailing out the banks once again.  In fact, this is really the only concrete area where the money can be spent.  The other two possibilities in the legislation are likely never to be used, short of a major crisis such as a migrant crisis or major reform of our pension system, for example.  These \"exceptional\" circumstances will be deemed to be thus not by Members of this House but by the European Commission.  The Minister for Finance is relying on people failing to differentiate between a nice-sounding scheme like a rainy day fund and this fund, which, when one reads it closely, can only be described as a bank bailout fund in the making.  I am sure that a Bill called the bank bailout fund Bill would be very difficult to get through the Houses of the Oireachtas and rightly so.<\/p>  <p>  One of the claims made in relation to the establishment of this fund is that it will tackle the issue of overheating in the economy.  Let us examine that claim more closely.  First, we must note that the latest CSO figures show a very modest level of inflation in the economy which is not exactly evidence of imminent overheating.  The idea that moving money into this fund will prevent overheating simply does not stack up.  The greatest sectoral source of overheating within the Irish economy is in the property market with ever increasing housing and property prices and an ever growing demand in Dublin city and its environ, as well as in other cities.  Overheating in the Irish housing market is best addressed through increasing the supply of housing, a policy which is inhibited by a supply and skills problem within the labour market.  The biggest threat from construction, however, is not from residential but from commercial property, as consistently pointed out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and nothing in this Bill will reduce that threat.  The skills gap is a threat too, as has been pointed out time and again, yet today we are being asked to siphon away &euro;0.5 billion each year, which should be used to build cr&egrave;che and educational facilities so that our population can be trained to fill the gaps and parents, especially mothers, can be empowered to return to the labour market if they so wish.  We know about the threat of climate change to our economy and our world but there is no possibility that this fund could be utilised to bring about the green industrial revolution that is badly needed.  The risks a rainy day fund seek to address are best combatted by transitioning the Irish economy from one which is dangerously exposed to global markets to one which possesses a stable economic base.  Such a transition would require sustainable investment in infrastructure, in skills and in the renewable energy and industry strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget that we already have a Strategic Investment Fund, SIF, that can be directed to make interventions and investments on a commercial basis.  It has &euro;8.9 billion of resources at its disposal.  It is a sovereign fund, investing and accumulating for the people.  How does the proposal before us this evening in any way improve on that?  In reality, the fund contained in the Bill before us actually raids the SIF to lock away money that is needed at this point in time.  If the aim is tackle overheating, this is a very bad policy choice and the excuses for it do not stack up.  This Bill is about championing austerity, normalising homelessness and third rate infrastructure.  It tells rural Ireland that it can wait for quality broadband.  It tells communities seeking their health rights that they can wait.  It says to the 10,000 people who are homeless, including 3,000 children, that they are second level priorities to be dealt with only after an arbitrary fund is filled.  <\/p>  <p>   We also have fiscal rules, championed by some parties in this House, which are supposed to keep us on the straight and narrow.  Sinn F&eacute;in has always said that those rules are too restrictive and conservative.  They copper fasten low spending but now it seems that for Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, they are not tight enough.  When times were tougher we were told by the aforementioned two parties that they would like to provide services but the fiscal rules would not allow it.  Now we are in a situation where we are making up our own tighter fiscal rules.  Fianna F&aacute;il wants to be associated with this plan.  Its members are clapping themselves on the back, claiming that they were the first to introduce the concept which they have now delivered through their negotiations with Fine Gael.  Let us look at what Fianna F&aacute;il originally promised.  Had we gone with Deputy Michael McGrath's plan and the promise in the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto, we would have to put &euro;3.785 billion into the so-called rainy day fund this year.  That is what the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto stated.  Surely that party would have delivered on its promises, or would it?  Fianna F&aacute;il said that once a balanced budget was achieved in 2017, any increase in corporation tax revenue above a base line of &euro;6.6 billion would be put aside to lessen the impact of any future slow down in the economy.  Perhaps Deputies Michael McGrath or Fleming, who are so eager to claim credit for coming up with this policy, can tell us where the nearly &euro;4 billion will come from this year, next year and every year thereafter.  How many nurses would they sack?  How many public servants would face the chopping block again, just as they did under the Fianna F&aacute;il led Government of ten years ago?  How many social welfare payments would be cut under this policy?  This is policy on the hoof and its original aim was to rehabilitate Fianna F&aacute;il which was the party of Government that drove the economy off the cliff and drove tens of thousands of our brightest and best to the four corners of the world.  Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be trusted.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not be the party to make Fianna F&aacute;il look fiscally responsible when its policies would be disastrous.  The root of the Fine Gael proposal is the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal.  I urge the Minister to rethink.  I urge him to get his priorities right and to put tackling the housing crisis, the cost of child care and the high cost of living above some half-baked, recycled Fianna F&aacute;il idea.  <\/p>  <p>  A hard Brexit is now a real possibility.  Today the Minister for Finance released a statement on the possible impact of a hard Brexit and it makes for sobering reading.  The idea that hours later he would come into this Chamber and talk about reducing our ability to invest is simply mind boggling.  Deputy Michael McGrath said the European Commission might let us use the money we have put into the fund to deal with Brexit but if there is a hard Brexit, it will happen before a penny goes into this fund.  The idea that we would lock money away in this fund and hope that the Commission would allow us to use it in the face of Brexit is absolutely daft.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900041#OO00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1548792300,"counter":545,"content":"<p>That is not what I said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900041#OO00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1548792300,"counter":546,"content":"<p>It is daft.  The Minister had advice prepared for him by officials last year for a question and answer session.  When he was asked if the fund would meet the uncertain cost challenges of Brexit, the answer given was that it is vital that the rainy day fund is not earmarked to meet the challenges of which we are already full aware.  Sinn F&eacute;in knows, as does Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, that Brexit is not an exceptional circumstance because it has been flagged for more than two years.  Indeed, the answer that the officials gave the Minister was that the Government and the Oireachtas must take responsibility for addressing these issues and that using the fund to meet the challenge of Brexit would create moral hazard and so on.  Brexit is just another idea being used to try to pass this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pension Reserve Fund was a rainy day fund which was raided by Fianna F&aacute;il to save the banks.  It is written here in black and white that one of the potential uses for this fund is a bank crash in the future.<\/p><p>The idea that the Minister can come into this Chamber and talk about reducing our ability to invest is mind-boggling.  Does he not see the connection between A and B?  A hard Brexit is all the more reason to keep our options open and to be ready to step in with genuine, countercyclical investment policy if and when it is needed.  <\/p> <p> At 3 p.m., the Minister told us that the level of economic activity will be approximately 4.5% lower than our existing trajectory over the medium term.  This aggregate figure hides an even larger hit to our economic activity in labour intensive sectors such as agrifood and indigenous SMEs.  At 6 p.m., he came into the House and asked us to support this Bill which will drastically reduce our capacity to respond in sectors such as agrifood and to protect our SMEs.  There is no joined-up thinking in this policy. <\/p> <p> We know from the Minister's briefing that the rainy day fund cannot be used to meet the challenges of Brexit.  It is stated in the information we obtained through freedom of information.  If the Minister wishes to produce a genuine rainy day fund, Sinn F&eacute;in will be all ears but we reject this sham rainy day fund, which in reality is a bank bailout fund because it ties our hands precisely at a time we need maximum flexibility.  The Minister should go back to the drawing board with Fianna F&aacute;il, his partners in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900041#OO00300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548792900,"counter":548,"content":"<p>My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, has outlined Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the Bill.  I want to pick up on some issues he did not address owing to time constraints, one of which is the contradictions in the briefing notes obtained by Sinn F&eacute;in via freedom of information requests to the Department of Finance.  These are notes provided to the Minister in the lead-up to the publication of this Bill in respect of press briefings and appearances before Oireachtas committees.  They detail various provisions within the legislation as published, including the withdrawal mechanism.  The Minister touched on this earlier when he said that one of the withdrawal mechanisms would have to be D&aacute;il approval.  In fairness, he stated that there would be an exception under section 9(4) in regard to seeking D&aacute;il approval but, up to that point, his stated view was that matters of national economic and financial importance should have the support and endorsement of not just the Government but also the D&aacute;il.  It is now provided in the legislation as published that D&aacute;il approval can be side-stepped if the Minister decides it is in the national interest and it is a crisis.  How do we reach that point?  The legislation states that the Minister responsible for the introduction of the Bill, which is the Minister for Finance, shall consult the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before bringing a proposal to Government to withdraw moneys from the fund.  In essence, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will have to stand in front of a mirror and ask himself whether he should withdraw money from the fund.  If the Minister thinks it is a good idea, he will then bring the proposal to Cabinet but if the D&aacute;il is in recess the money is simply withdrawn.  That is one of the clear contradictions between what the Minister was saying in the lead-up to the legislation being debated in the House tonight and what is contained in the Bill as published.  This highlights the Government's approach to this legislation over the past 12 to 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is making it up as it goes along.  This is a public relations exercise.  Fine Gael is trying to portray itself as a party of fiscal prudence while, at the same time, portraying other parties that are asking the Government to invest in housing, health services and public services at a time people are sleeping on the streets, lying on hospital trolleys in overcrowded conditions, living in direct provision and in family hubs, where children are at risk, as irresponsible.  The Government has opted to establish a rainy day fund for future crises, ignoring the crises we are currently trying to navigate our way through.  It is fiscally irresponsible to do what it is proposing to do and the Government, and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, know that.  They are setting out the dark scenario of a major economic downturn at some point in the future when we will be glad we have this &euro;8 billion fund while ignoring the fact that many people in this State tonight will sleep without a roof over their heads.  That is not only fiscally irresponsible; it is morally irresponsible.<\/p>  <p>  One of the other issues I want to touch on is the Minister's commentary on the fund being used as a potential bank bailout.  In this regard, the briefing notes provided by the Department to the Minister reference caution against closing off future uses of the rainy day fund at this time, particularly given we do not know what crisis could be faced into the future.  This includes a stopgap measure for the banking sector.  It is provided for in the legislation as well that the fund can be used to finance banks as a stopgap measure.  The public will not agree to this.  We all know what Fianna F&aacute;il did to this economy through the bank bailouts.  My grandchildren and my great grandchildren will still pay for it.  It is disingenuous of Deputy Michael McGrath to talk about other parties, such as Sinn F&eacute;in, trying to use this as a baton to beat the Government, trying to portray us as people who are not responsible.  As the finance spokesperson for the party that drove this economy off the cliff, he sought to lecture Sinn F&eacute;in on our public finances.  Brass necks does not cover it when it comes to Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am not surprised that Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to portray itself as having learned the lessons of the past.  The Fianna F&aacute;il I know will never learn the lessons of the past.  They are only in it for themselves.  Let there be no doubt about it - Fianna F&aacute;il is looking to a couple of general elections down the line when they will be in government and in control of this &euro;8 billion fund.  Their past history explains what they will use it for.<\/p>  <p>  The quicker we get this Bill to Committee Stage such that we can deal with the detail of it and get away from the PR and spin, the better for all of us.  I have no doubt that the public, when they understand what this money could be used for into the future when it could be used now to build houses and alleviate hospital waiting lists, will not support it.  I would be surprised if some of the Independent members of Government were supportive of it.  People need to take a long, hard look in the mirror, just as the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will have to do if he wants to bring a proposal before Government to withdraw money from this fund.  The quicker we move to Committee Stage and deal with the details of the Bill, the better.  I hope that the Government will listen to the reasonable voices within this Chamber and not to Fianna F&aacute;il.  I ask it to be open to listening to an alternative argument.  We are where we are today because previous Governments refused to listen to the Opposition when it put forward reasonable and rational proposals. <\/p><p>They refused to listen to it.  They thought they knew best but look where it got us.  I implore the Minister to ensure this Government does not repeat the mistakes of the past.  However, I am very sceptical as to whether that will happen.  Time will tell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900042#PP00200","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548793500,"counter":550,"content":"<p>This Bill is what one might describe as virtue-signalling.  In other words the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance want to send out a message that times have changed and that we hope not to go back the time of the bank guarantee when all the parties in the House, with the exception of the Labour Party, voted for this guarantee.  It was probably one of the biggest mistakes ever made in the country's history.  The Government is saying that with a fund of &euro;2 billion up front, and &euro;500,000 a year, our economy is more structurally sound than it might otherwise appear to be.  As a strategic tactic, I can understand why the Minister for Finance might want to send out virtue signals.  However, I find it very difficult to understand how a Minister for Finance, who presided over a budget on budget day, which bore almost no comparison to what he brought to this House as his forecast and outline of his budgetary position at the time of the summer economic statement and other statements, can attempt to lecture anyone and how he suddenly found, miraculously, another half &euro;500,00 down the back of the sofa to give to the Department of Health in the actual budget.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister also discovered in recent times that the overrun in the cost of the children's hospital, which is a much-needed project, is of a scale the country has never experienced before.  Can the Minister for Finance and the economic managers in this Government give us an explanation or account of their management as to how so much money has gone astray in just one area?  They have been completely silent.  They are now saying to us that this particular Bill is part of the fix of the economic difficulties we may face in the future.  I do not believe that and I know some of the people in government and in the Department of Finance are probably far too intelligent to believe that either.<\/p>  <p>  Strategically, virtue-signalling, by saying that a country is potentially more robust than it might otherwise be, may have its values.  Bear in mind, however, that as a country we now have, when one takes into account our gross debt minus the other holdings we have, somewhere below 60%.  That is the real situation and is the EU target.  It may not be recognised or presented in this way, but that is what the figures show.  It would be far better if we had a real conversation on where we really stand because we are now entering the scariest, riskiest point in our country's financial history as we approach the UK's decisions on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I see this evening that an amendment on a customs union proposed by the British Labour Party has been defeated in the House of Commons by 327 votes to 296.  At this point, I do not know what the fate will be of the other votes which are taking place later tonight.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's own commentary today confirms that we are at a very dangerous point.  The Minister and the Taoiseach indicated that two significant stand-out risks are that overall a difficult Brexit will lower growth by in the region of four points and we can anticipate an increase in unemployment of two points over a period of time.  These are not minor but are serious indicators.  A proportion of those people who are now back at work face a serious risk of unemployment and  families, individuals, towns and the whole country may again experience distress and hardship.<\/p>  <p>  We have the largest cloud hanging over the economy since the bank guarantee, NAMA, the collapse of the banks and the working out of that.  I was part of the Government that had to take up the reins of a mess when Fianna F&aacute;il walked off the pitch and left Government Buildings practically in darkness.  We had to pick up the pieces.  In particular after 2013, year after year, as Minister for Social Protection, I had to see money from the savings made in social protection by getting people back to work go to the Department of Health to try to stabilise its position.  Instead of Department of Health now being managed by the Government, which is challenging, the figures coming out of that Department are now worse than they have ever been.  For many people, unfortunately, the experience of the health service is nothing like it should be in a country as rich as this one.  Not only that but we are now facing a really difficult and dangerous strike by nurses who are looking to have their legitimate pay issues addressed in a competent manner by this Government which should be responsible for managing economic events.<\/p>  <p>  Instead, we are going to have a buffer in place of &euro;2 billion from the Strategic Investment Fund, followed by &euro;500,000 a year.  As has been said by many other speakers, we have absolutely no idea at what point it may be used, except that all the indications are that it is there as a kind of backstop to limit the impact of another financial, banking or fiscal crisis which is part of a European framework.<\/p>  <p>  There are certain issues that are giving rise to populism and are a danger to European democracies.  In this country, we have an acute housing crisis that is up-ending all the previous assumptions among young people, who have are in employment and are educated, that they should be able to afford to rent accommodation at a reasonable cost - for example, less than 25% of their income, although many countries would say 15% of their income.  They should be able to aspire to eventually purchase or build their own home as their parents and grandparents were.  We have allowed that particular expectation and assumption to be up-ended.<\/p>  <p>  I recall the Minister quoting Yeats in his last budget speech, saying the centre must hold as opposed to saying the centre cannot hold.  On housing, the Minister should know should know the centre is not holding.  There is distress among so many citizens that there are so many homeless people.  Instead of that problem being tackled, it is actually getting worse.<\/p>  <p>  How does one undermine an economy and a democracy?  One does that with catastrophic events like the bank guarantee and what happened afterwards.  One does that also by consistently undermining people's reasonable expectation that with education, hard work, diligence and application, they should be able to rent at a reasonable price and, at an appropriate time, be able to access a very secure long-term tenancy or to purchase or build a house.<\/p><p>The Minister may be seeking to shore up the Irish economy and to build people's confidence in this country that we can come through what may be a very difficult time with Brexit.  It is an event nobody in any part of this House favours, other than perhaps those from Solidarity-People Before Profit, who have said they are Lexiteers and are in favour of a left-wing exit of some kind from the EU.  However, I am not aware that others support Ireland quitting the EU.<\/p> <p> What we have is a situation where we are debating this very modest Bill to virtue signal in respect of &euro;8 billion over a number of years.  We would be far better in economic strategy terms to utilise the funds we have available in a careful way, given we have to be careful with money, to address the key crises that could undermine democracy in this country.  We have not really had a discussion on how exactly we are going to respond to Brexit, and we cannot have that discussion given we do not yet know the outcome.  What we were told by the Taoiseach today is that we are not going to see the actual details of the Brexit legislation until some time towards the end of February, and the assumption is that it probably has to be passed before 25 March.<\/p> <p> If ever there was a time when a Government has managed to put a whole load of carts before the horse, this Bill is one example.  If we have a very difficult Brexit, we will need to be able to have command of our financial resources and manage our debt situation in such a way that we can best maintain all the features of Irish Government expenditure that we wish to see maintained.  That includes current expenditure in terms of all necessary areas, such as education, health, social welfare.  We know what happened when the economy went into crisis.  I can remember the report called An Bord Snip and all the things that were to be cut or eliminated.  Let us remember that once countries have signed up to these events, it is not possible to call them back.  At this point, I find the idea that the Government would spend time on this legislation genuinely extraordinary.  The Government should be putting its best and brightest brains to addressing the significant issues we have, particularly in the area of capital investment in housing and the investment we require in education.<\/p> <p> We also need to take into account that there are expectations, to put it mildly, in terms of what is going to happen broadly on tax policy and tax structure in Europe.  We know already that quite a number of European countries are moving to digital taxation, particularly in regard to the very big IT and social media companies, because they are generating no tax revenue from all the spending their citizens are doing in these areas.  It is perfectly understandable that this is happening yet the Minister, even in the clean, cool air of Davos, could not acknowledge that Ireland has a problem in regard to how it deals with corporation tax and how it is not sustainable in the long term that social media companies and other companies would not contribute a fair share of corporate taxation to the different countries they operate in.<\/p> <p> This flies in the face of what is happening tonight in the UK Parliament in that we are potentially moving to a very difficult Brexit, if not a disastrous Brexit.  In the context of the Belfast Agreement, there is pretty much unanimity that we do not want a hard border in Ireland but I do not think this Bill is going to do anything to help any of that.  The Government is probably doing this on foot of Fianna F&aacute;il's original plans around this legislation, which were basically to get Fianna F&aacute;il in a position where it could begin to restore its reputation for fiscal rectitude, having wrecked the economy through the bank guarantee.  The Government's decision to go with this Bill is not appropriate at this time and it will not lead to a good use of funds on behalf of the people of Ireland.  The need to invest in housing is pretty much the elemental crisis this Government is facing yet is failing to manage.  As I said, despite the overruns on the children's hospital, which amount at this point to several multiples of the potential annual transfers to this fund, the Government seems incapable of being able to manage that.<\/p> <p> One of the first decisions the Government made was to abolish the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not believe it was loved by very many people but it was an oversight body which was meant to look at and query the spending of funds by different Government agencies and Departments.  We are now back to the good old days in that it is rolled into the Department of Finance, so it is very difficult now to even ask the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for a specific answer on a question around what has been happening to the children's hospital and the massive budget overrun.  He just passes that off, as the Minister for Finance, to the Department of Health and it, months later, sends a blah-de-blah reply with no actual detail on the information that, if there was proper accountability, it should be able to identify and answer for.<\/p> <p> It is regrettable that the Government should decide to roll along with this at this point in time.  We would be far better served by having a detailed discussion on the likely impact on businesses of a difficult Brexit.  Let us consider the position of people running a small business which is importing and exporting to and from the UK.  They will have to meet the costs of, for example, customs clearance if there is a hard Brexit.  We know that in regard to our imports of food from the UK there is likely to be what has not been seen in the Irish economy for ten years, which is a significant increase in inflation.  We are doing this against a backdrop where, in the context of the nurses strike, the Government is unprepared to discuss and establish a pay discussion forum for public service employees.  Public servants took a lot of cuts and experienced a lot of difficulties, and while there has been a process of restoration, many people have not got much, if anything, in the way of an increase.<\/p> <p> We are facing some very difficult times.  This Bill is a distraction and, as I said, it is virtue signalling in the hope that somebody in Bloomberg or some place like that will pick it up and say, \"This is very good, Ireland is putting away a few bob for the rainy day.\"  We know what they say about bankers and a rainy day.<\/p><p>They say when it is a rainy day, the bankers will take the umbrellas away, but when the sun is shining, the bankers will be out with the umbrellas.  To be honest, this is a kind of rather strange economic interlude but it is a distraction from the real issues that face us, namely, the difficulties around Brexit that we should be here tonight discussing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900043#QQ00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548794700,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900045#SS00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1548794700,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The simple-mindedness, paucity of thinking, ideological bankruptcy that lies behind this concept of a rainy day fund the Government is presenting in the Bill, which it has been arguing for some time, is staggering.  It makes clear that the Government has not the faintest clue or simply does not want to acknowledge why we had an economic crisis previously and why we will have another economic crisis fairly soon.  The Government had a rainy day fund prior to the previous crisis.  Did it stop the crisis?  No.  Did it stop vicious austerity being imposed on the people of this country?  No.  Did it stop a virtual economic collapse in the country?  No.  Did it prevent us having to go begging to borrow money and impose vicious austerity in order to get money from the European Central Bank, ECB, and the International Monetary Fund, IMF?  No.  Did it achieve anything?  The answer is \"No\", except &ndash; I am sorry but I forgot - that it bailed out the banks.  That was the one thing it achieved.  The same banks that are now selling off people's mortgages to vulture funds, repossessing their homes, and paying no tax because there is a tax loophole that incredibly allows them to write off previous losses for 20 years, even when they have restored themselves to extraordinary levels of profitability, and where the people running those banks are back earning shocking, obscene, staggering salaries of between &euro;700,000 and &euro;800,000.  That is what it achieved.  It did nothing to act as a buffer, and now the Government just wants to do it again.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Government learnt anything at all?  It is just mind-boggling.  The Government wants to draw us into an argument about how we fight over these little crumbs rather than look at the storm that hit us the last time and the storm that will hit us again when the markets to whom the Government bows down wrecks economies overnight.  Its take on the economic crash which is used to justify this is Orwellian.  It peddles the myth that we were spending beyond our means.  The Taoiseach goes on about it and says the nurses cannot get paid because the reason we had an economic crisis the last time was public servants were paid too much.  That is not the reason we had an economic crisis; we had an economic crisis because the rich in this country, in America, across Europe and just about everywhere in the western world, had spent the previous 15 to 20 years turning housing, the most basic human need, into an object of speculation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900045#SS00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1548794700,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900045#SS00400","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1548794700,"counter":556,"content":"<p>That is what happened.  Even a child knows that.  Everybody knows it but the Government pretends it is not the truth.  It was something to do with the fact that public servants, apparently, were living beyond their means.  That is just preposterous.  I think it is happening again.  All the developers who helped bankrupt the country, those greedy people who speculated on Irish housing then went into NAMA and were paid &euro;200,000 a year to get back into business were nurtured back to profitability and then the State gave them back all the assets and property which we had at least off got them and should have kept.  Now one of them, Se&aacute;n Mulryan of the Ballymore Group, is selling back a property to the Central Bank.  The ironies just pile up.  The Central Bank moved from Dame Street a few years ago to the docklands and it is now going to buy another property beside its new headquarters from Mr. Mulryan.  The total bill is &euro;200 million.  It is unbelievable.  One could not make it up but it is happening.  It was in the business pages of the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>last weekend.<\/p><p>I do not know if anyone has even mentioned that.  I find it beyond belief.  All the boys are back in town and now they are backed by an even greedier bunch.  The previous Irish property crash was financed by the banks and the greedy Irish property speculators.  Now, having nursed them back into business, in order to hoover up everything, they have gone to America to get the big vulture funds to come in and back them financially so that they can get everything back and get even more.  They will have even greater control over the Irish property sector, which is running riot, and, against that background, the Government is saying we should put &euro;500 million a year into a rainy day fund.  It is an absolute joke.  Even if I thought it was a good idea, by the time the next economic crash comes, there will be bugger all in it anyway compared to the likely hit.  It is just nonsense.  I would not mind if the Government said we need a safety net or a buffer after we do the things that would begin to create some insulation for the economy and society against the inevitable economic crash that will be caused by those people again.<\/p><p>When the next economic crash comes, which it will, will the Government say it is down to the public servants or to the nurses?  The Taoiseach was implying that today.  He said if we concede to the nurses, we are one step closer to an economic crash.  Whether the nurses get paid, an economic crash will come and it will have nothing to do with them.  However, what it will have to do with is the greedy people in the financial markets and the people who have taken control of the property sector, many of whom are the same, deciding at a certain point that they are shifting their money somewhere else because it is not profitable enough for them anymore.  That is when the crash will come.  We have no control over what they do because we have given them more control over wealth, assets, the financial system and property than they even had before the previous crash, which they caused.<\/p><p>That is what the Government has done and, against that background, this Bill is pathetic.  What the Government could do if it wanted some insufflation for the economy is to start to get back some of that surplus wealth those individuals control, the movement of which can destabilise this economy or the wider European or American economies.  It is due to the fact that such wealth is even more concentrated than it was before the last crash that they can destabilise our economy and the global economy.  Unless we address that fact we do not have a prayer of dealing with the next crash that is coming.  I am amazed that nobody even asked those questions.  I doubt that any economics or financial correspondents are even listening to this debate.  They think they have heard it before and there is no point in discussing it.  They will discuss tomorrow's crisis, whatever that is, but not provide a deeper analysis of why crashes happen and what we might do to the system that generates the crashes again and again, where they tend to get worse and where the concentration of wealth, the ingredients that generate the crises in the first place, are accumulated on a bigger scale each time there is a crisis.  We will have part two tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900045#SS00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548794700,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019: Order for Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1548795300,"counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900046#TT00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548795300,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to provide that Lenders may not transfer mortgages on residential property without the consent of the borrower and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1548795300,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900046#TT00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548795300,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1548795300,"counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900046#TT00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1548795300,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am proud to move this Bill and hope it can get cross-party support in this Chamber.  I must say there is no reason for that cross-party support not to be given, because it simply implements what Deputy Michael Noonan said was best practice during his time as Minister for Finance and what the Central Bank&rsquo;s own code of practice recommends.<\/p>  <p>  In simple terms, the Bill puts into law a code of practice that the Central Bank itself drew up.  The first line of that code of practice provides: \"A loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower\".  In other words, no consent, no sale.  There may be some who say that this is a fine principle in normal times but we are not living in normal times, and they are right.  These are not normal times.  In normal times we do not have &euro;2.34 billion in arrears of over 720 days.  In normal times we do not have 64,510 accounts linked to family homes in arrears, 45,178 of them in arrears of more than 90 days.  Accounts in arrears of more than two years now constitute 43% of accounts in arrears, and at &euro;2.4 billion, represent 90% of outstanding arrears balances.<\/p>  <p>  These are not normal times.  We are living with a problem caused by a banking collapse.  We need a political and societal response to that, not just one that protects the banks.  We must find a solution that looks after the families in arrears and indeed the tenants whose landlords find themselves in arrears.  For my party, vultures are no part of that solution.  They are profiteering out of misery and should be shown the door.  Fine Gael rolled out the red carpet and we must now live with the consequences.  The Pontius Pilate act played by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, as State-owned banks sell mortgages that are paying their way is despicable.  On 29 November last year Permanent TSB announced it was selling 6,139 loans linked to family homes.  This is not the first time family home loans were sold by this bank or other banks, including the State itself through the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation, IBRC, to vulture funds.  What made this a new low was that the mortgages involved were those of families meeting their agreed arrangements with the bank.  No sale to vultures is right but this sale was particularly offensive.  It is time for action.  It is time to say, \"Enough is enough\".  <\/p>  <p>  I will give Members a quick run-through of the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 contains interpretations of the sections.  Section 2 is the crucial section.  It introduces an obligation on a lender to seek permission from the borrower before a loan is sold when it relates to a residential property.  Section 3 legislates for cases where the original lender will service the mortgage as an agent of the transferee.  The lender shall confirm that the transferee&rsquo;s policy on the handling of arrears and in the setting of mortgage interest rates will be the same as that of the original lender, and that the original lender will handle arrears as its agent.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 sets down the conditions where the original lender is surrendering control over interest rates and arrears policy.  This will require the explicit consent of the borrower.  Section 5 lists the information that must be transmitted to the borrower on foot of a request for consent under section 2 of this Bill.  It may be the case that some of these points are already covered by the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  This is something we can tease out on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Section 6 sets out the rights of the borrower and the duties of the transferee in the case of a transfer.  Section 7 is important.  It lays out some very specific exemptions to section 2, which requires consent, such as when a bank is failing.  The term \"serious business difficulties\" is defined as, \"difficulties of a gravity that the Central Bank determines that a lender is failing or likely to fail\".  There are no wide exceptions in this legislation.  This is a tight definition based on the triggers that would precipitate the resolution process in EU law.<\/p>  <p>  Section 8 sets out powers for the Central Bank.  Section 9 confirms that a lender in breach of this legislation is liable to the administration regime of the Central Bank.  We can discuss how adequate that regime is, but for now the important fact is that there are repercussions for ignoring this law, unlike the code from which it derives.  Section 10 allows the Central Bank to draw up implementing regulations while section 11 of this legislation is the title of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that this Bill is in no way a get-out-of-jail-free card for borrowers.  In no way does it mean a borrower can simply not pay and expect to stay in his or her home.  That spin comes from desperate Government Deputies trying to divide their own constituents rather than stand up to the vultures.  We must always draw ourselves back to the question of context.  How did we get here?  Did tens of thousands of previously unblemished families suddenly lose the will to pay their mortgages in full?  Of course not.  That is not what happened and we all know it.  The cruel irony is that the banking collapse directly led to the loss of jobs and of businesses which in turn lead to hundreds of thousands falling into arrears.  Ten years after the banking collapse, these same banks are now turning on those families unfortunate enough to have suffered during that time and are throwing them to the vultures.  This is a vicious circle and its victims are hardworking families and individuals doing their best to recover after the banks crashed the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Anybody with a sense of justice or fairness must see these vulture sales as completely unacceptable.  The Government will surely say this Bill will end the market for vultures in this State.  I hope so.  I have no problem saying that.  I do not want a vulture economy and neither does my party.  Why not?  It is because it is unfair for capital to swoop on distressed families, businesses and farms and pick off what it can before abandoning them.  Vultures are interested in the short term.  They see short-term profit and they swoop.  That is not healthy for our economy or for society.  An economy where vultures are prospering, often paying little tax if any, is not a healthy economy.  It is the type of economy Sinn F&eacute;in wants to end.  I am on the side of the struggling farmer, the struggling homeowner and the small businessman and businesswoman, not on the side of the vultures.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, let us look at how the banks are treated.  These banks, which are being allowed to sell family homes to vultures, do not pay a penny of tax on billions of euro in profits and will not pay for a decade or two decades in some cases.  They are subsidised by the help-to-buy initiative, they are allowed to charge rip-off interest rates, they reduce services in rural Ireland bit by bit and, to deal with the question before us, they are allowed sell off their loans without the consent of the borrower, in breach of the code of practice of the Central Bank, albeit that is a voluntary code.  Why?  The bailout is supposed to be over.  These banks are profitable, so why is the Government policy about protecting them at all costs?  Why are they not doing their job and making arrangements with customers who have paid them for years or decades while the banks ripped people off and stole their tracker mortgages?  The European Central Bank, ECB, and the Central Bank have made it abundantly clear that there are many options available to banks to reduce their non-performing loans.  However, this State has championed the cause of the vultures despite the damage and the pure economic short-sightedness of it.<\/p>  <p>  I note the reported comments of the Central Bank today saying this Bill would bring about some type of Armageddon for everybody involved.  Its spokespeople are implying that implementing a code the Central Bank itself drafted in 1991, a code that still applies, would lead to instability, increased prices and less lending.  We have all heard this song before.  Whenever a positive proposal is put forward to protect consumers from the banks or vultures it is the same tune.  It is not credible and it cannot be used as an excuse to stall progress.  This legislation is nearly word for word what the Central Bank code provides.  That is a code that still exists, by which the Central Bank says that lenders need the consent of a borrower before a mortgage is sold.  The Central Bank is taking a disgraceful position if the reports are true.  There will be no Armageddon.  We will see a healthier banking culture.<\/p>  <p>  I should not need to remind anybody that the Central Bank is supposed to hold a mandate to protect consumers in financial matters.<\/p><p>How is its position in opposing this Bill compatible with that mandate?  A central bank drawing up a code of practice criticising directly democratically elected Deputies who try to implement that very same code is a crazy situation.  It is time to end the fixation with vulture funds and put people first.<\/p> <p> This legislation is very simple.  As stated in the code of practice, the Central Bank's own code, \"A loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower.\"  That is where Sinn F&eacute;in stands, and proudly so.  I look forward to hearing where others stand.  We are saying let us all join together and say very clearly, \"No consent, no sale\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900046#TT00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548795900,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Maire and Sean are a married couple in my constituency in Dublin Mid-West.

The D&aacute;il will recall the sale by NAMA of Project Eagle in the North and of Siteserv, and the role of Cerberus in all of this is still the focus of a commission of investigation chaired by Mr. Justice Cooke and of an investigation in the North by the National Crime Agency.  <\/p>  <p>  The voluntary code of practice states: \"A loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower.\"<\/p><p>The Central Bank has acknowledged that no lender or credit firm has ever been punished for breaches of the code of conduct.  In the years since the economic crash, the Central Bank has been more concerned with the welfare of the banks than the welfare of families at risk of losing their homes, including many in County Louth.  Many households and small business owners in the county face uncertain futures because their mortgages have been sold off to vulture funds or whose mortgages might be sold off in the months ahead.  An Teachta Pearse Doherty's Bill will protect households against their mortgage being sold to a vulture fund without the permission of the person involved by placing the code of practice into law.  If it is good enough to be in the code of practice, it is good enough to be in legislation.

The apparent logic behind Deputy Pearse Doherty's Bill is that customers whose loans are sold to private equity funds are worse off than those whose loans are not sold.  The Central Bank carried out a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, otherwise known as the CCMA, to ensure it remains as effective as possible and to examine this perception.  The Central Bank sought the views of consumer representatives and advocates working to assist borrowers in financial difficulty, engaged with statutory bodies and industry stakeholders and conducted inspections of a retail credit firm, two credit servicing firms and a bank.  It also gathered and analysed data relating to arrangements under consideration or being put in place by banks, retail credit firms and unregulated loan owners and ascertained whether they were more or less active in relation to repossessions.  As the House will be aware, the Central Bank found the CCMA is working effectively and as intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.  It also found no material difference in the level of repossession activity.  In fact, if we look at the number of principal dwelling house, PDH, repossessions that took place from quarter 1 to quarter 3 of 2018, out of a total of 727, banks were responsible for 644 repossessions and non-banks were responsible for 83.  The Deputy's apparent logic does not stack up.<\/p>  <p>  The House will recall that late last year, the Government supported and assisted Deputy Michael McGrath in bringing his Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 into force.  The plight of those who find themselves in mortgage arrears is a major concern to the Government.  This is demonstrated by the establishment of the State funded Abhaile scheme, which seeks to get solutions into place for those in mortgage arrears by providing them with free and independent expert advice and support tailored to their individual circumstances.  This includes the identification and negotiation of solutions, and support at court if they are facing repossession proceedings.  As recently as yesterday, the director of the Insolvency Service of Ireland highlighted how 95% of personal insolvency arrangements negotiated by personal insolvency practitioners result in people staying in their homes.  We are making progress but we need people to engage in the process and we are doing all we can to encourage this.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has significant concerns about the terms of the Bill from a consumer protection, prudential supervision and financial stability perspective.  It, too, is strongly of the view that the various statutory Central Bank codes of conduct and the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Acts of 2015 and 2018 provide sufficient protections to consumers whose loans are being sold.  As the Minister for Finance has stated many times in this House, all mortgages or other loans which are sold or assigned to a new creditor will continue to be subject to the terms of the contract as entered into by the borrower.  As a matter of contractual law, the new creditor is not able to unilaterally change the terms and conditions of that contract.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty has cut and pasted, with some minor amendments, the outdated voluntary Central Bank code of practice on the transfer of mortgages.  This is not how good legislation is developed and drafted and, consequently, it is no surprise that it conflicts with other more recent legislation.  The voluntary code was put in place as far back as 1991.  However, the legal, regulatory and consumer protection environment has changed significantly since then and it is no longer suitable for a very changed financial environment 28 years later.  The Central Bank has informed the Department of Finance that it intends to consider withdrawing the code this year in light of the key protections now contained in statutory codes.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty's Bill will ban the sale of any mortgage loan unless explicit written consent is given by the consumer.  The level of interference proposed by the Bill in the mortgage market is, we believe, both disproportionate and potentially unconstitutional.  One of the Government's key priorities is to support the normalisation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900048#VV00300","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1548796500,"counter":572,"content":"<p>That old chestnut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900048#VV00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1548796500,"counter":573,"content":"<p>-----of our banking system over time.  The Government is working to ensure that our banks are able to invest in households and businesses and provide the credit and lending that is needed, all the while ensuring that the most appropriate and effective framework of consumer protection is in place.  This Bill does not in any way support or complement these key priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from preventing loan sales to tackle non-performing loans, the Bill would also impede the funding model for mortgages because it makes securitisation almost impossible, increases the risks for lenders and effectively raises questions over the use of asset covered securities as a funding source.  All these issues would result in increased interest rates for existing standard variable rate mortgage holders and would also be reflected in reduced new mortgage lending with obvious knock-on effects for the construction of new residential property.  This would go against all that we are trying to do in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  As the Bill compromises the transferability of mortgages and weakens them as a form of security, it would also be reasonable to expect that it could render residential mortgages ineligible for use as collateral by banks when seeking European Central Bank, ECB, or Central Bank emergency funding in liquidity operations.  This would be a catastrophic development if a crisis were to occur in future.  As we saw during the most recent crisis, Irish banks pledged a large portion of their mortgage books as collateral to the ECB for emergency funding and to take away this flexibility would create obvious financial stability risks.  The Central Bank of Ireland and European Central Bank will only accept collateral for funding purposes that can be taken over if a bank defaults on its obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The main mortgage lenders in the market have used asset covered securities as part of their funding strategy for many years through issuing bonds for market funding.  These bonds are acquired, in the main, by international investors as the structure is well understood and similar to that which exists in other European markets.  The covered bonds rely on the assumption that they are secured on the underlying mortgages which can be accessed in a distressed situation.  Clearly, anything which could impact investors' ability to access their collateral could severely impact the credit rating of such instruments and, by extension, the pricing and investor appetite for such bonds, potentially rendering the model inoperable.<\/p>  <p>  Securitisation is an important part of the financial system and when the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 was before the Oireachtas at the end of last year, it was the subject of much consideration.  It was accepted that the passive securitisation model, where the investors do not play a role in the administration of management of an individual loan, do not have any significant adverse implications for consumer protection.  However, the Bill proposed by Deputy Doherty, which requires borrowers consent for all loan sales or assignments even if the assignment is undertaken for bank liquidity or other legitimate commercial purposes, will, even though it will not impact in any material way on the borrower, reverse this approach and could set at naught the approach adopted for the recent Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The rehabilitation of our banking system has been slow but good progress has been made.  A critical element has been the reduction in the number of non-performing loans and much of this has been achieved through non-performing loan sales.  The continuing high level of non-performing loans on Irish banks' balance sheets is a vulnerability that presents a risk to financial stability and could impede the provision of credit through additional regulatory capital requirements.<\/p><p>It also results in an opportunity cost in foregoing new lending to households and firms.  Again, both the Central Bank and my Department believe that the costs imposed by this Bill on financial institutions may in turn have the chilling effect of increasing interest rates for consumers which is the last thing we want to see.  It is also important to highlight that if loan transfers to third parties are no longer a viable option for banks to allow them reduce their non-performing loans, a likely consequence would be an increase in the number of repossessions by banks.  The significant commercial and financial restrictions imposed on lenders by this Bill has the potential to restrict their ability to raise liquidity and funding on reasonable terms and their inability to sell their non-performing loans could have knock-on capital implications.  It could impose significant economic and financial costs for the Irish economy and society and, as we saw in 2008 and the following years, this burden will eventually and ultimately have to be met by the Exchequer and society at large.  Therefore, this Bill does pose very significant long-term implications and inherent contingent liabilities for the Exchequer and therefore it does not require a money message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900048#VV00500","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548797100,"counter":575,"content":"<p>It does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900049#WW00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1548797100,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Apologies, it does require a money message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900049#WW00300","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1548797100,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Is the Minister of State sure about that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900049#WW00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1548797100,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I am sure.

It was a devastating event and it puts everything else into perspective.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to make some remarks on this Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, in his response on behalf of the Government, certainly did not hold back in the predictions he and the Department have made about the implications of the Bill.  He cited increasing interest rates, an increase in the number of repossessions and significant economic and financial costs for the Irish economy and society as a whole.  It is important the Government understands, certainly at least from our perspective within Fianna F&aacute;il, why there is such frustration among consumers and mortgage holders with the current system and the difficulties they face on a day-to-day basis in dealing with so-called vulture funds.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGuinness is the chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and Deputy Doherty is a member of it.  We have tried on many occasions to get the so-called vulture funds to come before the committee to engage with us, answer questions, debate their business model, the way in which they deal with individual mortgage accounts, the type of solutions they offer and how they make their decisions.  On each and every occasion they have refused to engage and to come before a committee of this House.  This House passed a motion on that very issue sometime ago.  That in itself leads to much suspicion and worry.  <\/p>  <p>  One can say what one may about the banks, and we certainly do not hold back at that committee or in general in this House in criticising them where it is warranted, but they come before that Oireachtas committee, complete a very detailed questionnaire and answer questions.  We are not always satisfied with the answers we get but we do get engagement and there is no hiding place for them.  When we contrast that with the other loan owners, these funds which purchase loans from financial institutions, there is no accountability, no engagement and up until recently, those funds had no direct oversight by the Central Bank.  I welcome the fact that the Government supported our Private Members&rsquo; legislation which, in essence, regulates those funds for the first time.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister's Department and his support in bringing that about, and in recent days ensuring that it was signed into law.<\/p>  <p>  It has long been our position as a party that the banks should be working through their loan books themselves.  They should be making decisions on a case-by-case basis.  They should know their customers.  They certainly should have an intimate knowledge of the history of each individual mortgage account and they are best placed to do everything that possibly can be done to rescue that mortgage and to ensure that the family home is saved.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge there are mixed messages from the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  When we met its representatives in Frankfurt some months ago, they were at pains to say they set no targets.  There is no pressure on the institutions to reduce their non-performing loan levels.  I know that is not the case.  They may not have told the banks how to do it but they certainly have told them they must do it and that they must reduce their non-performing loan levels to European norms of the order of 4% to 5% of their loan book.  Therefore, they are speaking out of both sides of their mouth.<\/p>  <p>  When it is said, as it often is, that the vulture funds are more likely to do deal with borrowers than banks, that may well be the case if one is willing to sacrifice one's home.  As somebody who advocates for borrowers and deals with individual cases quite a lot, I have not come across an instance where somebody has been able to stay in his or her home and has negotiated a very good deal with these vulture funds.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding this legislation, we will support it on Second Stage.  It warrants very careful examination at the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said it does require a money message.  I take it the Bill will not be in any way supported by the Government, in fact it will not allow it to proceed to Committee Stage, but perhaps the full pre-legislative scrutiny can still be conducted and that should be done.<\/p>  <p>  An opportunity was missed when it came to the review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  This is an issue I raised directly with the Minister.  Under section 39 of the code, any lender is only required to consider the forbearance options, the alternative repayment arrangements that it offers.  It is only required to consider those; it is not required to consider the full suite of options that are available under the mortgage arrears resolution process.  There is a gap, a deficit, there.  It means that, in effect, these funds can say to borrowers that they do not provide split mortgages or arrears capitalisations and are not in breach of any code, notwithstanding the regulation that has now been extended to them.  That is a change that should have been made and the Minister should still make that change.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, when we brought forward legislation to provide powers to the Central Bank to restrict interest rates.  That, too, was knocked back by the Department and by the Central Bank but the reality is that if one of these funds decided tomorrow morning that the interest rate on a loan is to double from 4% to 8%, there would be a hue and cry.  It would be a scandal but there is nothing that anybody in this House, the Central Bank or in the Minister's Department could do to deal with that because the Minister refused to put on the Statute Book even limited powers to deal with the egregious interest rates which are currently being charged in some cases but which potentially could be charged in a scenario where interest rates are increased.<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental problem with these funds is that their business model is very different from the banks.  The banks hope to be here in 20, 30 or 40 years.  They hope to build customer and brand loyalty.  If they give out a mortgage there is a reasonable expectation that bank will still be the institution accepting the final payment on that mortgage in 20 or 30 years.  There is no such expectation with any of these funds.  They will not be here in ten, 15 or 20 years.  They simply have a different business model.  We are not only looking at one portfolio sale to one of these funds.  We will see these sales go on again and again and the reality is that loans, over the course of the life of a loan, may well end up changing hands on multiple occasions, and that is not in anybody&rsquo;s interest.  It is not the road that we should be going down.  <\/p>  <p>  There is obviously an issue regarding the application of this code in respect of mortgages that have already been written.<\/p><p>Borrowers have signed a mortgage contract which explicitly allows the lender to sell on the mortgage.  Perhaps it is a legal question.  I would value independent advice from the Parliamentary Counsel or others on whether the Bill, if enacted, would have any impact on mortgage contracts already been entered into.  Can the Oireachtas set aside that contractual provision to which both parties have already signed up?  I have my doubts, but it is a matter of legal opinion.<\/p> <p> On the consequences of the Bill for the financial system, the banks and so on, significant issues have been raised.  Securitisation is a legitimate and bona fide financial transaction, especially in this context where it is passive, where there is regular management of loans and decisions on loans are made by the existing lender who continues to hold legal title.  From my perspective, it is a bona fide transaction.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said on behalf of the Government that, if enacted, the Bill would lead to an increase in interest rates.  Irish consumers and mortgage holders are already paying far more than they should be for loans.  That is an issue we need to examine further and make progress on.  It was also said it would stop non-performing loan sales.  There is no doubt that the banks are under immense pressure from the European Union.  They should work through their loan books and deal with them.  If the Bill enters a pipeline that it will take many months to come through, it could accelerate non-performing loan sales because if someone in a bank is looking at a high level of non-performing loans, he or she might try to sell them before any such legislation came into place.  That matter would need to be teased out.<\/p> <p> There is a real issue, much of which derives from the lack of engagement and accountability of the so-called vulture funds.  They are not easy to deal with, as I can tell the Minister personally.  People have a reasonable expectation that their bank will continue to work with them and continue to administer their mortgage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900049#WW00600","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548797700,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I support the Bill and encourage the Government to reconsider its position.  All of the contributions I have heard so far, by Deputy Pearse Doherty and his colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, as well as by Deputy Michael McGrath on this side of the House, have focused on the individual borrower, the person with the mortgage or loan that has gone wrong.  I stand beside them, as Deputy Pearse Doherty said he does, including farmers, businesspeople with bad loans and those in mortgage distress who have families and are in difficulty.  I do not know how the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, can stand over his contribution as that is not what he stands for or believes in.  He read it for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I do not think he read it for himself.  Within government and on the Independent benches there is not complete support for the direction it has taken.<\/p>  <p>  When the banks failed, the Government rushed to their support, set out new legislation, declared that it was an emergency, that they were different times which required the type of radical legislation that was implemented at the time.  The banks that the Minister is defending have since got back to that position, with &euro;1.6 billion in profits and do not pay tax, while the vulture funds are encouraged by the Government to buy up distressed mortgages and loans, with no accountability to this House.  The position might not be as bad if one was to set out the type of legislation required to save the 80,000 or more mortgages that are in distress.  They are not just mortgages.  They are families and people we know within our communities who are affected by the banks.  They did not set out to take out a massive mortgage and build a massive house.  We all know the stories of how they went to the banks and came out with almost double what they had gone in for.  They came out with car loans for which they had not gone in.  They put their confidence in the banks which, not for the first time, led them astray.  Now that they are in distress, they are turning to this House and pleading with us to give them some protection against the vulture funds, but  the only response from the Government is to trot out a considerable amount of nonsense and misinformation.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputies Michael McGrath, Fitzmaurice and others, I have gone to meetings with vulture funds.  They do not do deals.  Even if they did, how does a person with a distressed loan or mortgage raise the money to buy himself or herself out of the problem when he or she has already been reported to the bank, appears on the credit bureau listing and, therefore, cannot obtain credit?  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said there was only a small number, 83, of repossessions in the names of non-banks.  There were 644 by the main banks.  The Minister of State should put himself in the position of any one of those families.  It does not just happen on one day but over a long time; it could be ten years.  That family have to sit with their children, go through the trauma and allow the next generation of younger people to see what it is like to be treated in that way by a bank and a Government that does not care.  We are not just ruining the lives of the parents but also those of the children.  As we condone the actions of the banks, we are educating the next generation of bankers to be just as disgusting as this lot.<\/p>  <p>  The argument is made that borrowers do not engage with the banks.  Any of the people with whom I have dealt has not only engaged with the bank but every single week has written and phoned it.  However, there is no engagement.  The people concerned want to make an arrangement and honour their commitments.  I am not arguing for those who do not want to pay but for those who are decent, have gone through difficulties and want to work their way out of them.  We are not giving them the tools necessary to deal with the banks and their legal arm of banks and to assist them to get out of the difficulties in which they find themselves.<\/p>  <p>  The vulture funds do not deals, do not come before this House and are not accountable.  The Minister will say all of the protections travel with loans as they pass to the vulture funds, but they really do not in practice.  Let us look at the structure involved in Permanent TSB transferring loans to Glenbeigh Securities and then to many other companies, before they finally end up in a trust fund in New York.  All of the major houses that make money because of the trauma and desperate situations in which people find themselves are involved with the vulture funds and we do nothing but encourage them.  The Central Bank and the European Central Bank are as much to blame.  They never talk about the rights of the consumer and never stand over the rights of a whistleblower; rather, they stand full square behind the banks in full support of the terrible damage they do to Irish society and we say nothing.<\/p>  <p>  I want to look at another arm of the State - the courts.  I fully understand the separation of powers, but the last port of call for thousands of families is the masters court, where he checks the paperwork from the banks and borrowers.  He has forced the banks to correct the paperwork or acknowledge that their paperwork is not adequate to press the charge against an individual concerned before the court.<\/p><p>Most of these individuals are lay litigants, by the way.  Having done this and done the State a hell of a service while being fair to the banks and to the borrowers and creating a level playing field, he has now been removed from that task by the President of the High Court<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900050#XX00200","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548798300,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Scandalous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900051#YY00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1548798300,"counter":584,"content":"<p>It is an absolute scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900051#YY00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1548798300,"counter":585,"content":"<p>It is a scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900051#YY00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1548798300,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I was astonished to learn last week that the media knew of this before Mr. Honohan did.

It is a good Bill.  I do not understand why we would not want to do something about an element of the code of practice that would basically give it a bit of power.  I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and, my God, I do not know what has happened in two years.  Perhaps Ministers of State are reeled out, the senior civil servants hand them a page and they must read out whatever BS is on it.  He is absolutely not the same person I knew two years ago, when we sat in front of the Minister at a table.  I spent about 80 days up and down the road for all the good it did me.  The first thing that was agreed with the officials of the Minister at the time, Deputy Noonan, was that before any bank could go to the courts about someone in a distressed mortgage, a split mortgage or mortgage-to-rent would have to be offered in the first two days.  Have we seen this since?  Absolutely not.  I hope we are not wasting our night here and that the Government does not do its usual trick with a money order and send it to their good buddies whom they were with over in Davos and all these other places over the past week or two, and their buddies in Brussels who want to bring in other legislation to ensure that all loans that banks have can be sold on to vulture funds.<\/p>  <p>  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, put it on the record, and there is no doubt about it from what we have heard tonight from the Minister and the Taoiseach, that they are lovers of vulture funds.  That is a sad thing.  I heard what came out in the report tonight, and I do not think the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, believes the stuff he read out, that vultures are better.  Let us be very clear.  If a bank sells on a mortgage, a vulture will not offer the borrower a split mortgage.  That is the bottom line.  Let no one cod themselves.  They look for a demand of money.  Yes, a borrower who has one house and who is willing to get the hell out of it will probably get a write-down if the loan is bigger than the house is worth.  This option is not very freely available to people with young families.  This is what we are saying to the people.  There does not seem to be any sympathy at all or any attempt to do anything about this.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be very clear on this.  A Bill was tabled here by Deputy McGuinness.  I supported it, as did Deputy Mattie McGrath in front of me.  Edmund Honohan put it together.  It is sad to say that in the case someone who checks paperwork and who tries to ensure a level playing field, which is all any of us is looking for, is made sure he will not handle cases again for whatever reason.  This is a person in whom many people would have put faith and who has given a bit of fair play to everyone on both sides of this argument.  This does not just go one way.  What happened over the weekend was disgusting.  I am just flabbergasted that the Government will not support this Bill.  We need even stronger legislation.  This is for people to stay in their family home.<\/p>  <p>  Fr. McVerry told us a week ago that there are 12,000 buy-to-lets.  Even if one is not worried, as the Government is not, about the people who own the houses, what about the people living in them, which would be 24,000 or 30,000 people?  We know about the current homelessness situation.  Are we more worried about what Goldman Sachs made?  I saw today what it made as a vulture.  Are we lovers of Promontoria?  Are we lovers of all these vulture funds around the world?  Do we play the good kids of Europe to ensure we will get our loan books down and say, \"Yes, sir\"?  This scaremongering is used then that interest rates will have to be higher and all these other different scenarios.  There is always a solution for a bank.  If it sells a loan to Promontoria, Goldman Sachs or whoever else, it can always say to the borrower, if he or she does want to get rid of it, that it will give him or her a 40% or 50% write-down.  Their options are always there.  Is it wrong to say to borrowers on the first day they go in that they must sign their name to the loan to the effect that they have done a deal with whichever bank they have done it with?  Then the bank can decide to sell something on.  We need a little realisation in this country.  If I buy something, I will not be selling it down the road again.  I take the risk on it.  Banks have been bailed out in this country to the tune of &euro;65 billion.  There was scaremongering as to what credit unions would or would not do.  They did not get near the money.  They only used a few million.<\/p>  <p>  We seem to have this psyche that whatever the ECB, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance say goes, that the banking sector must be left tax free and make plenty of money, that anything that looks dodgy will be sold on to someone else outside of this country, and that our country must be owned by foreigners.  We are more concerned about this than looking after men, women and children in our own country.  What is going on is deplorable.  I am not a conspiracist but I believe that what I saw happen to Edmund Honohan over the weekend represents a stacking of the odds against the ordinary person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900051#YY00900","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1548798300,"counter":591,"content":"<p>We now move on to Solidarity-People Before Profit.

He challenged the ruthlessness and brutality of these banks and vulture funds in how they dealt with people in mortgage distress who were trying to engage with them, and called them out for their ruthlessness.  This matter is related to what we are debating here and the way in which the Government, in defending its opposition to this eminently humane Bill, makes reference to the potential impact on the global financial system and the system of securitisation of loans which lay at the back of the global crash of 2008.  The Government is defending that.<\/p>  <p>  The position under the Central Bank's voluntary code was that what this Bill proposes should, in fact, be the situation and people's mortgages should not be sold without their consent.  However, the Government says that code was introduced 20 years ago and things have moved on since then.  What has moved on is that the banking and financial system now depends on the securitisation of these loans in order to function.  According to the Government, that is the reason we cannot do what the Central Bank, until recently, believed we should do when it comes to dealing with these loans and the relationship between the borrower and the lender.  <\/p>  <p>  One could be forgiven for concluding, as I do, that the Government's response to this Bill is to simply forget about the human being.  The vast majority of people who were in front of Mr. Edmund Honohan, or in front of the courts, are just ordinary, decent human beings who, in good faith, obtained loans to put a roof over their heads because that is the only way vast numbers of people can get a roof over their heads.  These people did not seek to rip off the banks and society but to put a roof over their heads, notwithstanding whether their loans are performing or non-performing loans.  The bottom fell out of the economy because of the actions of the financial institutions and others speculating on property and driving the property market out of control.  That was not the fault of ordinary people with either performing or non-performing loans.  The idea seems to be that those people somehow have to take the rap to protect a financial system that is out of control.  The fact that the financial system was out of control was what landed us all in this mess in the first place.  The Government is defending that and has used it as its defence against a Bill that provides that people should have the right to consent or not consent to the sale of the mortgage loan they agreed with their bank or mortgage lender.  I am trying to remember the type of lender Permanent TSB is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1548798900,"counter":596,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy mean vulture funds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900052#ZZ00500","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1548798900,"counter":597,"content":"<p>No, there is a name for institutions like Permanent TSB.  In any case, I am referring to banks and other forms of mortgage lenders.  I do not accept the Government's defence for one minute because it means the human being goes out the window.  It inflicts cruel anxiety and hardship on people who sought those loans in good faith.  If borrowers have got into trouble with repayments, in the vast majority of cases it was not of their making.  Deputy McGuinness and I have plenty of experience with people in these circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  When the chief executive officers of the banks appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach they state that all will be fine if people just engage with their bank.  From direct experience of dealing with people, I know that trying to engage with the banks and find somebody to talk to in the banks is often like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  Sometimes, the only reason people manage to get a bit engagement is that a Deputy who, like me, has a line through the committee steps in and he or she may get the phone number of the CEO.  Those are the lengths to which people have to go to get a meeting between two human beings to discuss the case.  Even then, a reasonable solution may not be found because a week or month later different officials will be dealing with the case and may say they do not remember there was a meeting or this, that or the other.  It goes on and on and, at the same time, the letters and threats keep coming from the bank.  These terrify people who then end up in court facing threats of repossession.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill proposes to bring this back down to a human level.  It provides that the individuals who sought loans to put a roof over their heads would have the right to insist that the institution that gave them the loan maintain the existing arrangement.  Borrowers would be able to refuse to allow their lender to flog off their loans to somebody else who does not know or care about them and views their mortgage loan as nothing more than an opportunity to make profit or trade on international markets.  I see no justification for the Government's opposition to this Bill, other than that it has become a complete and utter slave to the financial markets and will do whatever the markets say.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish by repeating something I said in the earlier debate.  Let us contrast the Government's defence of the right of these banks to flog off people's loans to vulture funds, which will do what the hell they like to distressed mortgage borrowers, with the case of our friend, Mr. Sean Mulryan, who was in the news over the weekend.  Mr. Mulryan borrowed hundreds of millions of euro and helped to bankrupt the economy, along with his other developer friends, yet the State engaged with him.  The National Asset Management Agency paid him &euro;200,000 to get his business going again.  Mr. Mulryan then got himself out of NAMA with the assistance of some of the major international financial operators and is now back in control of sites in the docks, which he is flogging to the Central Bank for about &euro;200 million.<\/p>  <p>  The State engaged with Mr. Mulryan who was shown a great deal of human consideration.  He was not a good faith borrower seeking to put a roof over his head.  Having helped to crash the entire economy because of his greed, he is back in business and the Central Bank is to pay him &euro;200 million to buy new premises beside the spanking new premises it has already required.  Having moved from Dame Street, it will buy another new premises from Mr. Mulryan.  The contrast could not be greater.  That is a bit of moral hazard.  The only moral hazard the Government is concerned with is the hazard that might impact on global financial speculators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900052#ZZ00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1548798900,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to the families of Shaun Harkin, Daniel Scott, John Harley and M&iacute;cheal Roarty on their tragic loss at the weekend.  Everybody, across the country, feels very strongly for them and I pass on my condolences.<\/p>  <p>  I support this legislation which stands in stark contrast to the position Fine Gael has maintained since it came to power, that of taking the side of vested, private sector interests over the interests of ordinary people in this State.  Since Fine Gael came to power, vulture funds have fast become a normal feature in the economy.  Distressed mortgages are now regarded as a commodity, which are bundled up in new financial products and offered as fresh pickings for vulture funds making their way through the economy at the invitation of the Government.  Fine Gael continues to open up the market to include a wider net of homeowners vulnerable to vulture fund takeovers.<\/p><p>A new low has been reached.  The Government and those with vested interests in the sector have been doing their best to make out that vulture funds are a sign of a healthy, functioning economy.  So much spin has been spun that when the Central Bank's report on the credit servicing funds was published before Christmas, the Government and key players in the industry, including the Central Bank, used the same report to speak positively about vulture funds.  They made out that the vulture funds are not only good for the economy but were better than the banks for those with distressed mortgages.  Either the banks have reached a new low in the country or spending has reached a new high.  Either way, we are in sorry times if vulture funds are better than banks because the banks are bad and vulture funds are worse.<\/p> <p> The existence of vulture funds in our economy is a symptom of a complacent Government prioritising private sector interests over the interests of ordinary people.  It is also a symptom of a banking system collapse and a system that has failed to provide a service to its people.  Banks, through incompetence and prioritisation of a select few, have developed a situation where vulture funds could easily move in.  The recession was used by the Government and banks to transfer the responsibility of loans to other entities beyond the radar of the Central Bank regulations.  This is no doubt done on purpose because it suits Fine Gael to shirk its responsibility for financial hang-ups from the recession and place them on another entity.  For that reason, those of us in opposition, who have defended the rights of homeowners, have consistently called for greater regulation of credit financing firms.  That is why I support the Bill.  <\/p> <p> The Bill aims to put on a statutory footing the original voluntary code and ensure the terms of the original mortgage and the way in which they deal with arrears remain the same.  However, the Minister has already ruled out putting the mortgage transfer code on a statutory footing, defending the stance by saying consumers are already fully protected.  I have long believed the role of traditional pillar banks, as we know it, is over.  They are no longer functioning for everyday people and have instead protected the interests of a select few.  This is not taking into account recent scandals which are too many to list.  For that reason, it is worthwhile considering alternative banking models and considering the role of credit unions which will work on behalf of people.  A capital-rich credit union business could easily replace a foreign vulture model with &euro;14 billion on deposit.  The credit unions could take on distressed mortgages from banks and work directly with homeowners to find long-term, sustainable solutions.  That is a solution that would benefit people and that is not what the Minister is interested in.  <\/p> <p> The problem of vulture funds will not go away any time soon.  In an alarming new proposal, a European Commission directive aims to develop a secondary market for non-performing loans which would expand the distressed mortgage market and increase the role of vulture funds in the economy.  It will also restrict the right of EU member states to impose their own regulations on vulture funds.  Inevitably this will undermine the rights of borrowers and consumers and ultimately homeowners.  Instead of voluntary codes, we need to see a complete ban on the role of vulture funds in the mortgage and housing sector but apparently the EU always works on our behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900052#ZZ00700","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548799500,"counter":600,"content":"<p>One of the most regressive developments in economics from the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the Thatcher-Reagan era, was the process of securitisation and the bundling and selling of loans.  The most despicable aspect of that development was the bundling and selling of mortgages and home loans.  It has profoundly impacted on hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens, especially in the years of this Government since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to strongly support the No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019 tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Last Wednesday, I attended Deputy Pearse Doherty's informative briefing on the Bill and heard outstanding contributions on the mortgage and securitisation crisis from David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders Association and Carly Bailey, whose family lost their home in this despicable process.<\/p>  <p>  We passed the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) (Amendment) Act in 2018, which became operational in the past week.  I spoke strongly in support of that Bill and I welcome the small step towards regulating vulture funds.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Bill will profoundly strengthen the regulation by requiring the consent of the mortgage-holder before a mortgage can be sold.  It is a welcome addition to a process of finally beginning to regulate vulture funds.  It is a pity that coalition partners, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, are not supporting this welcome Bill.  A point Deputy Pearse Doherty made on a number of occasions and which my colleague, Deputy Pringle, has just made is that what we are doing here is simply putting on a statutory basis the Central Bank's mortgage rules and making them a statutory requirement.  It is very disappointing to read today that the Central Bank is warning the Department of Finance not to support the Bill and saying it will somehow reduce banks' ability to sell non-performing loans.  One of the scandals is that so many performing loans have been sold to vulture funds.  A whole host of other spurious reasons were given in the Central Bank's opinion on why the Minister should not do this.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister knows from his experience in Dublin Central, as I know from Dublin Bay North, that the Bill is the right way to go and we should do it.  It is sad that Fine Gael has had a particular affection over the years for vulture funds.  I was in this Chamber when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Michael Noonan, extolled the virtues of vulture funds.  He talked about vultures in the ecosystem.  They fulfil a useful function.  He obviously meant they pick the carcass clean.  In this case we are talking about the intense suffering of families who have lost their homes and suffered grave stress.  They are the kind of constituents we meet week in and week out.  We had the appalling situation a few weeks ago when the Taoiseach said that vulture funds are more effective than banks.  The reality is that Fine Gael, over the past eight years, has done everything possible to protect the kind of asset-earning, profit-motivated actions of the pillar banks, all banks and the flotilla of vultures that follow in their wake.  <\/p>  <p>  I support the Bill proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900053#AAA00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1548799500,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I appreciate being in a position to support the Bill.

It is very disappointing that the Government will not support the Bill because it is exactly what it should be doing.  Every person in the House should support it.  There are big write-downs for everybody.  There were write-downs for people who owed millions of euro.

There is a meeting in the post office on Clogheen tonight, which I should be at.  The post office is being closed thanks to the Minister.  Most of us here unanimously agreed we should support the post offices for 12 months and put some capital into them to allow the introduction of the community models we looked at in Denmark and Germany with the profits going back into the community.<\/p><p>However, the Minister vetoed it.

He spent countless hours and days preparing legislation to be brought to the House.  He has been fair.  He has not been unreasonable to the banks, he has been fair with people, and he has been admonished and removed from the system by the powers that be at the Government's request because he is appointed by the Government and not by the courts, Mr. Justice Kelly or anybody else.  He is appointed by the Government.  The Minister knows that but he wants no message of support for ordinary people.  The Government is in hock to the banks.

This same bank has sold thousands of home loans to vulture funds and third parties.  The families who had these loans were paying back the money they owed.  They had agreements in place and were doing everything they were supposed to do but Permanent TSB was happy to sell their loans to a vulture fund.<\/p>  <p>  It is quite telling that banks, many of which were bailed out by the taxpayer when their gross mismanagement led to the banking crisis, are now turning on those who are doing their best to repay their loans.  I would have thought, given the disaster caused by the banks in this State, that the Government would have stepped in and tightened up regulations in this area.  The Minister cannot stand by as banks throw their customers to the vulture funds.  This legislation is just one example of what the Government should have done.  Most vulture funds have no interest in working with borrowers to restructure or renegotiate their loans.

It aims to protect mortgage holders or householders from having their mortgages sold on by banks to vulture funds without their consent.  We all know what vulture funds are capable of because we meet people in our constituencies who have been their victims.  I have come across many such people in my own constituency of Laois-Offaly.  Banks have sold mortgages with &euro;150,000 still owing to vulture funds for as little as &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000.  The same offer was never made to the householder because it did not fit in with policy and the Government never included it as part of its policy.  Such an offer would have made the mortgage affordable and sustainable for the mortgage holder who was in difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking here about the same banks into which the State put billions of euro of taxpayers' money in order to save them.

That service plays an important role in ensuring that citizens can stay in their homes while dealing with their financial difficulties.  I did not hear a single Opposition Deputy refer to the insolvency legislation which has played such an important role in reducing the level of distressed debt in our country.  No one made the point that the level of repossessions that we have seen in our country to date has, thankfully, been below that forecast by many when our country was dealing with enormous levels of financial difficulty.  No reference was made by any Deputy to the supports that are in place, the progress that has been made or the various laws that were enacted by this and the previous Government that have played a role in offering support to citizens at times of great difficulty.  Of course I know, because I represent such citizens too, that those supports do not always work for people.  I know that despite the supports that I have acknowledged - but that no one else acknowledged - there are citizens in all of our constituencies for whom they are not enough.  They still find themselves in difficulty with their banks.<\/p>  <p>  Let us deal with the legislation that is being proposed here.  <\/p><p>The legislation proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty would not just remove the ability to make loan book sales to private equity firms or the so-called vulture funds referred to, it would also, in effect, remove the restriction on a bank to make any loan book sale to anyone.  I have said time and again that loan book sales should only happen after every mechanism and option has been explored, something which has not been acknowledged in this debate.  The reality is that the numbers of non-performing loans of the banks have to be reduced.  In the period from 2008 to 2011 I heard speaker after speaker call for regulation, independent institutions and a Central Bank that was up to the job, but when the Central bank issues a statement of concern about this legislation, it is dismissed.  Members cannot have it both ways.  They cannot call for an independent regulator and strong Central Bank institutions and then, when they raise concerns about the effect of legislation such as this, dismiss them by saying they are not looking to serve a longer term interest and alleging various things about their intentions.  <\/p> <p> The challenging reality is that many of the banks have levels of non-performing loans in an economy that has been in income and employment recovery for many years which, in some cases, are too high.  I have heard many speakers reference Permanent TSB, but I have not heard a single speaker reference the fact that at the start of last year Permanent TSB's figure for non-performing loans, as a percentage of its balance sheet, was nearly 24%.  After years of effort, one quarter of its loans were impaired.  I acknowledge that more could and should have been done for some, but after years of effort to try to reduce the level of non-performing loans, that is where the bank stood, at a multiple of the European average and way ahead of where many other banks in Ireland stood.  <\/p> <p> What has also not been acknowledged is that even if this legislation were to be passed, the banks would still have those targets.  They are not targets which have been set by me; rather, they are set by the same independent regulator that this D&aacute;il, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, stated we must have and could not undermine.  They are the targets set and why have they been set?  They have been set because in the awful event that we get into another economic crisis and if the banks enter it with the level of non-performing loans they had until recently, we will have banks that will not be as strong as they need to be in facing a changing economy, a new level of risk being created, a doom loop banking crisis and difficulties we have all said we want to prevent.  That is why the levels of non-performing loans are being reduced and targets are being set to have them reduced.  If a bank has a difficult balance sheet, it affects the rates of interest it can offer to new businesses and its ability to make new credit available to families, farms and small and medium sized companies Members and I represent.  <\/p> <p> As outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, a money message is required for the Bill.  It is my view that if the Oireachtas passes the Bill, it will have significant and negative consequences for the ability of the banks to meet the needs of the regulator in terms of regulation, for which many speakers both this evening and in previous years called.  It is for that reason the Government is opposing the Bill, as well as the likely affect it would have on the financial interests of the State such that a money message would be required.<\/p> <p> I will not allow any speaker to allege that because I am aware of wider interests that the banking system has to meet, in particular, the need to meet the requirements of an independent regulator which this D&aacute;il, in the aftermath of the crisis, stated needed to be in place, and because I am making the point that the banks need to be able to meet new and existing investment and lending needs, I am indifferent to or do not care about the anxiety or worry citizens, including families, face.  No Member of the House has a monopoly of compassion or understanding of the difficulties citizens can face.

In those dark days the banks ran roughshod over the people and the State authorities mandated to protect them, most especially the Central Bank, abrogated their responsibilities.  Images and scenes that we thought had been  consigned to the history books and would never see again have re-emerged, all under the watch of the Fine Gael-led Government.  Unprecedented numbers of citizens are lying in sleeping bags on footpaths tonight in cities and towns throughout Ireland.  This has developed as a direct result of the Government's failed housing policies.  Families are sleeping in Garda stations, bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels and so-called temporary solutions.   The Government has stood on the side of the banks and against ordinary people who sustain Ireland as a society.  The ordinary people of Ireland want to live in a society, but it seems that the Government wants us to live in an economy.  Let us put this notion right.  The Government - Fine Gael and its Independent colleagues - can outline which side it is on:  it is either on the side of the banks or the people.  I do not accept the red herring that enactment of this legislation would lead to higher mortgage interest rates.  We already have the highest interest rates in Europe, again, under the watch of Fine Gael in government.  It has failed to take on the power of the banks and the markets because it sees them as allies.  It has allowed vultures into the country because it will not interfere or upset the market, but it will happily sit back and watch families being dragged by the ears from their homes by the banks and their thugs.  <\/p>  <p>  I commend Teachta Pearse Doherty on bringing forth this legislation.  I suggest a significant majority of the people will also commend him.  Again, I advise the Government has a choice.  It can put power back with the people and statutorily provide for their legal consent or it can ignore our needs and interests at its political peril.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900056#DDD00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1548801300,"counter":629,"content":"<p>It is clear that vulture funds have no interest in reaching solutions with homeowners.  They have no interest in restructuring loans or providing for interest only payments.<\/p><p>The sale of distressed mortgages by banks such as Permanent TSB to vulture funds puts homeowners and renters in a very dangerous position that could result in large-scale repossessions.  The Government has shown itself complicit in such sales.  The State is a major shareholder in Permanent TSB, owning 75% of the company.  This is a company that was bailed out by taxpayers' money to the tune of &euro;4 billion.<\/p> <p> Last year Permanent TSB sold its Project Glas loan portfolio to Start mortgages, an affiliate of the vulture fund, Lone Star Funds.  The portfolio contains loans which Permanent TSB considered as non-performing loans.  It later emerged that the sale also included performing loans.  Many of the people whose loans were being sold to the vulture fund were people who were genuinely paying their mortgages, after making prior arrangements and agreements with Permanent TSB.  The State has a responsibility to these people, particularly as it is the primary shareholder.<\/p> <p> In a real case, a constituent of mine in secure employment and with a disabled adult in the family has a mortgage of just over &euro;100,000.  He is up-to-date with repayments on this mortgage, agreed with Permanent TSB.  This mortgage has nonetheless been sold to that vulture fund causing himself and his family great distress and uncertainty.  Should their house be repossessed another family with a disabled adult will be made homeless.  This Bill will empower borrowers like this and prevent banks causing such uncertainty and distress to families by selling loans to unregulated and unaccountable vulture funds.  I urge TDs to support this Bill and end the distress of families and the threat of homelessness that hangs over many of their heads. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012900056#DDD00300","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548801900,"counter":631,"content":"<p>First, a Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, I thank all the Members who participated in this discussion tonight and in particular those, which was everybody apart from the the two Ministers, who support and see the need for this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to thank those who expressed sympathy with me and Deputy Gallagher and the wider community, particularly the families of the tragic victims of the road collision on Sunday.  There are no words that can express the hurt and loss that has been experienced by the families and friends and wider communities of Gweedore, the Rosses, and Cloch Cheannfhaola on the loss of Shaun Harkin, Daniel Scott, John Harley and M&iacute;cheal Roarty.  It is a very difficult time we are going through.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to this legislation, this is the code of practice that the Minister asked about back back in 2012, when he tabled a parliamentary question to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  Deputy Noonan's answer said in answer to that that notwithstanding its voluntary nature, he expected that best practice would dictate that the code be applied by all institutions to all classes of residential property.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister telling me that Deputy Noonan was telling him that the bank should do something that was going to wreck the economy, push up interest rates, lead to mass evictions and repossessions and every other thing that the Government side has thrown at this Bill tonight?  The reality is he was not; this is the same code of practice that has been in place in the Central Bank since 1991 and is still in place there.  The Central Bank has a code of practice where it outlines to the banks what they should do in the case of transferring a mortgage.  We have repeated time and time again that the first line of that advice is that a loan should not be sold without the consent of the borrower.  This is a very basic principle which has never been rescinded.<\/p>  <p>  There is only talk about having it rescinded because I have have started to question this issue and the legal premise of the fact that it is voluntary, and the fact that I have met with the Central Bank and informed it that I am bringing forward legislation to put this into a statutory code.  All this legislation is doing is what the former Minister, Deputy Noonan told the current Minister back in 2012 is what the banks should have been doing anyway.  The code of practice that is currently in place does what Central Bank is saying. <\/p>  <p>  Questions were raised on the constitutionality of the Bill and Deputy Michael McGrath raised a pertinent question as to whether legislation like this could impact on existing contractual law.  If one looks at the 1976 Family Home Protection Act, at that point in time a spouse, usually a man, who was the sole registered interest in the home, if selling on the property could do so without the consent of his partner and spouse.  This House introduced legislation that changed that and said \"no consent, no sale\".  One had to get the consent of one's married partner if one wanted to sell a a loan, remortgage the property and so on.  It is the same premise that it is here in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  A number of other things have been said about this Bill which simply do not stack up.  Deputy &Oacute; Caolain put it well when he talked about red herrings.  The reality is that the mask slipped when the Government, in the Minister's first introduction, said that it was in favour of the normalisation of the banking system.  To me it is never normal when family homes, and people who are meeting their arrangements have their loans sold on to the vulture funds without their consent.  That is not the type of normal banking system that I or people out there want.  The Minister says over and over again that the Opposition does not have a monopoly on compassion for those who are in mortgage distress and find themselves at the peril of the vulture funds or the banks.  If that is the case then stand up and show us, because the Minister holds the shares in Permanent TSB that allowed the bank to sell 6,139 mortgages which were meeting their arrangements to Glenbeigh, a fund which will pay Permanent TSB for these mortgages and will get the receipts from these individuals paying their mortgages.  This fund is unregulated and will continue to be unregulated, despite Deputy Michael McGrath's legislation.  This is a fund that could raise interest rates in the morning and can change the rules without any recourse.  This legislation is about taking a side and doing what should have been done many years ago because it is past time, unfortunately, for so many people who find themselves in the grip of vulture funds.  For many others we can ensure that we can protect them.  The simple point is that vultures should never have long-term products, they only have short-term interests.  That is the problem.  It has been said before by David Hall and Deputy McGrath and others, and I concur with them, that if one wants to lose possession of one's home and have the residual debt written off, than a vulture fund is a place for that person.  If one wants to stay in the family home then it is better to remain with the bank.<\/p>  <p>   Many Deputies in this House have been waiting a very long time to find out if the Government is going to issue a money message or not.   Tonight the Government is saying that it could block this Bill on Committee Stage, despite this D&aacute;il democratically wanting this legislation on the Statute Book.  The Government is saying it will block this.  I am saying that we will fight the Government on Committee Stage on this Bill.  I will finish on this valid point; I believe that the Government has been abusing its position on money messages.  If on Committee Stage, after legislative scrutiny it is believed that this Bill should go forward, and the Government attempts to block it by way of a money message, then maybe we need to do this in a legal forum because this would be an abuse of process.  There is no charge or additional tax on the people and the Government's arguments are flimsy because it wants to stand for the vultures, for the banks and against the people.
