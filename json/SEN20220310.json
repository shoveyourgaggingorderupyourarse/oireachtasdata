I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I do not know how much he knows about the eastern bypass but I will take him through some of it and my understanding of it.  The Dublin eastern bypass, or the Dublin Bay motorway, as it was called, was a proposal originally considered and drafted in 1971.  That is a hell of a long time ago, over 40 years ago.  The idea was that the bypass would complete the Dublin sea road across Dublin Bay and back through what we now know as Booterstown Marsh, up into the back of Booterstown Avenue, right across to the Radisson Blu Hotel, cutting across the N11, then proceeding to UCD, up to the Drummartin Link Road, in Goatstown, and eventually connecting to the then proposed M50.  The M50 is now long in place.<\/p> <p>We know there is huge congestion in that part of Dublin - or was.  It is now reduced.  The traffic demands are not what they used to be.  We have also seen major urban sprawl and many people now moving out of Dublin because they cannot afford to live there.  We therefore see the pressure points in Kildare, where the Minister of State's constituency is, in County Meath and as far as Laois, Westmeath, Wicklow and even Wexford.  That is the reality.  There has been a shift in people's desire to live in places outside the Dublin area, but we clearly have issues around Dublin.<\/p> <p>There were three proposals for the bypass.  One was a viaduct under a tunnel and one was a viaduct or bridge over Sandymount bay.  These plans and this route fall into two local authorities, namely, Dublin City Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  As the Minister of State will be aware, both local authorities have county and city development plans and both from time to time have changed the indicative line, that is, they have dropped it from the Dublin city plan and put it back into the plan.<\/p> <p>The reality is that the tract of land that runs from Booterstown right up to UCD is possibly the most valuable in the country.  It offers huge opportunities for housing and more.  There is now a shift in the emphasis in transport to greenways, cycleways and bus connectivity.  I understand that there is a desire on the part of the Green Party not to proceed with the eastern bypass, and I can see some of the logic in that.  What I am trying to find out is whether due consideration has been given to releasing these lands or whether they are to remain frozen for another 30 or 40 years.  These are exceptionally valuable lands with enormous potential for housing and the possibility of a route that would link UCD, which has major plans.  As well as being a university, it has on-campus technology and a vision to develop an educational hub and a technological centre and to have a proper synergy between academia, commerce and the wider world.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That would be really good.

There is enormous value and potential in the land and it is time we had some indication of the Government's intention for it, working with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the other State agencies involved in transport, and having regard to the need for consultation on connectivity and other issues with the two local authorities, that is, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#A00600","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for giving me the opportunity to address the Seanad on the Dublin eastern bypass corridor from Booterstown to Sandyford and the possibility of alternative uses being considered.  I am sure he will acknowledge that there are a number of different actors within this sphere and that a lot of work has taken place over the past number of years.  That work remains ongoing.<\/p> <p>The national development plan identified the southern port access road as one of the projects to be progressed through early planning and appraisal during the period of the plan.  The proposed project would provide connectivity between Dublin's north and south ports.  Based on the NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area for 2016 to 2035 and the Dublin city development plan for 2016 to 2022, a southern port access road connection between the Dublin Port tunnel and Poolbeg would also have served as the first part of a future Dublin eastern bypass.<\/p> <p>Dublin City Council commissioned a feasibility study in 2020 to consider the southern port access road and its interface with the more long-term objective to deliver the Dublin eastern bypass.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Tll, also commissioned a study this year to review current policy, traffic assessments and requirements for the southern port access road and the eastern bypass.  As part of that, it commissioned technical advisers to review the need for the eastern bypass scheme and the justification for proceeding.  The review found that the need for the scheme, as originally identified, was no longer justified.  The strategic assessment report concluded that the eastern bypass had limited benefits for the M50 and would adversely affect tunnel operations.  It also concluded that should the scheme not progress, there was merit in considering some of the alignment for priority bus measures and active travel.  TIl has briefed the relevant local authorities and the NTA.  I understand the report will be published on the TIl website in the near future.<\/p> <p>That briefing by Tll fed into the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area that was published in November 2021.  Measure ROAD4 of that strategy states that the NTA will undertake an assessment of the potential for the southern section of the former eastern bypass corridor reservation, as provided for in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county development plan, to be used as a transport corridor accommodating sustainable transport modes.  Pending completion of this assessment, the existing reservation should be retained.<\/p> <p>I understand the NTA is currently in the process of reviewing the observations made during the consultation period and preparing a revised draft transport strategy for submission to the Minister for Transport for his consideration, in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  The NTA anticipates further dialogue with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on potential alternative uses of the corridor following the finalisation and completion of the transport strategy process.  I understand the Department of Transport has not been involved in these discussions, which have taken place at an agency and local authority level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#B00200","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I agree with the Minister of State on those points and I thank whomever prepared the reports because they came to the right conclusion.  There is potential for a new transport corridor or some mechanism of connectivity from the coast right up to UCD and beyond and, more than that, there is also enormous potential for residential development.

The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has also announced further funding of &euro;60 million for investment in greenways.

The funding committed in budget 2022 for investment in sustainable transport projects is proof of the Government's commitment to active travel.

In fact, one could say it serves people travelling from Donegal to Wexford as it is the route they link onto to access the N4, N5, N63, N56, N60 and a number of other regional roads.

We have moved on from there and I am glad to say that, in recent years, it has been prioritised and routes have been reviewed.  I want to talk about a 15 km stretch of the route, namely, the Ballymurray-Knockcroghery bypass.  It appears that under TII's plans for 2022, there is no funding available to continue the progress on this route.  There is no money for design and environmental plans to be put in place.  The question I am being asked by people living along the route, motorists and local authority members is whether the project has been shelved.  My information is that it has not been shelved but I await the Minister of State's reply.  It does seem to have been pushed back.<\/p> <p>I emphasise to the Minister of State, and I ask him to take this message back to the Department of Transport, that we really need to get this project going as speedily as possible because it is a route with a lot of danger for motorists.  Unfortunately, there have been a large number of accidents on it.  There are schools, churches and businesses along the route and thousands of vehicle travel it every day.  It is not a quiet national secondary route through our county; it links to many other roads.  I ask the Minister of State to take the matter back to the Minister.  I am making a strong case that TII must get back to putting funding into this particular route in order that the 15 km bypass can proceed without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#B00700","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murphy for clearly articulating the importance of the N61 project.  The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and Exchequer funding in respect of the national roads programme.  I am responding on his behalf.<\/p> <p>Once funding arrangements have been put in place with TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 and in line with the national development plan, NDP, the planning, design, improvement and upgrading of individual national roads is then a matter for Tll, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Tll ultimately delivers the national roads programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework, NPF, and the NDP.<\/p> <p>Under the revised NDP launched in October, approximately &euro;5.1 billion is earmarked for new national road projects to 2030.  This funding will enable improved regional accessibility across the country as well as compact growth, which are key national strategic outcomes.  The funding will provide for the development of numerous national road projects, including the completion of projects that are already at construction stage and those close to it, as well as the development of a number of others.  The progression of any project will be subject to compliance with Government policy, availability of funding and further approvals.  All projects under the NDP or, indeed, any proposed projects outside of the scope of it will typically require the necessary approvals under the public spending code.  This will include Government approval in cases where project costs are estimated to be above &euro;100 million.<\/p> <p>In line with the public spending code and planning requirements, two sets of approvals are typically required for a proposed new national road project to proceed to construction: approval at specific decision gates under the code, including of the project business case, and approval by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of an application for development consent.  The necessity to meet the requirements of the public spending code and any applicable planning consent, along with an adequate capital budget, are key to delivering national road projects.<\/p> <p>The N61 is a national secondary route in County Roscommon, connecting Athlone to Boyle via Roscommon and Tulsk.  Regarding the N61 Ballymurray to Knockcroghery element, Tll has provided an update on this scheme.  Technical advisers were appointed in early 2019 to progress the planning and design of the scheme.  The scheme has now progressed through the route option selection phase.  Environmental and technical surveys have been completed and an emerging preferred route was identified in late 2021.  The emerging preferred route was presented to the public in December 2021 and January 2022.  Given funding constraints in 2022, TIl was not in a position to provide funding to progress the overall scheme in 2022, as the Senator outlined.  However, I refer to the earlier point made in the response I have given.  The completion of projects that are already at construction stage is where many of the resources are going at present.  Obviously, a lot of money has gone into this project to get it to this stage and I am sure it will progress in time and that the investment will not be lost.  For now, however, TII has not allocated funding to it for 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#C00100","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome the reply.

Approximately &euro;616 million of Exchequer capital funds have been provided to TII for national roads in 2022.  In line with the NDP and Government policy, TII is allocating national roads funding to local authorities for 2022 in a manner which seeks to achieve the following outcomes: protection and renewal of the existing national road network; progress major projects in or near construction; progress major projects which are pre-construction but well advanced in the development pipeline; and prioritise any remaining funds for major projects which provide for local bypasses and compact growth in Ireland's towns and villages.<\/p> <p>It is necessary to prioritise projects for funding in a manner which seeks to achieve key outcomes in line with the NDP and NPF.  As a result of this, while a large majority of the projects were issued a funding allocation in 2022, TII was unable to provide an allocation for a small number of projects.  The delivery programme for these projects will be kept under review for next year and considered in terms of the overall funding envelope available to TII.  Although TII was not in a position to provide funding to progress the overall scheme, in 2022 funding of &euro;300,000 was provided under TII's minor improvements programme to progress improvements on the section of the route.

I was very pleased to see the major expansion of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme announced yesterday.  It is extended to an additional 310 schools, and 37 of the existing schools in the programme are being reclassified and are eligible for increased supports.  That is incredibly important.  I have always been a big supporter of this programme in schools.  Indeed, I have seen the difference in many schools in Kildare.  In fact, I taught in a school that was in the first classification back in 1990.  I remember Sr. Concepta Conaty who worked on this programme and was a very strong advocate for it.<\/p> <p>I believe the area of home-school liaison is incredibly important for supporting parents and guardians and providing co-operation across the entire school community.  Yesterday morning, I was with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in Newbridge town hall with regard to women's health week and I was delighted to see that one of the home-school liaison teachers I know had brought mothers from the school.  They might not necessarily have availed of that event if not for the opportunity to meet within that school community.<\/p> <p>While I welcome the six additions in Kildare, there is one glaring absence, in my view, which I wish to discuss.  I have always been a powerful advocate for inclusive education.  Access to education must be universal and the education we provide must meet the needs of every individual student.  Our education system must be adaptable and flexible, and offer adequate support to advance learning and development.  That is exactly what the DEIS programme does.  It focuses on targeting additional resources at schools with the highest concentration of students at risk of educational disadvantage.  It provides the home-school liaison that I mentioned, school completion, hot meals, extra teaching supports and extra schoolbook schemes.  It is very important.<\/p> <p>I have been calling within the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party for the widening of the band for some time.  I am very proud that it was a Fianna F&aacute;il Government that introduced this and I welcome the work of Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, in respect of it.  However, Scoil Na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge has still not been included and, for the life of me, I cannot understand why.  I remember 2017 when the then system was expanded.  I could not believe how this school, the newest and biggest school, catering for most certainly the children coming from more vulnerable backgrounds, was not included in 2017, and I was absolutely shocked to see that it was not included yesterday.

DEIS schools benefit from a range of supports, including a DEIS grant, access to home school community liaison officers and a school completion programme, in addition to priority access to continuous professional development and other supports.  The DEIS programme focuses on targeting additional resources at schools with the highest concentration of students at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p> <p>There is a strong evidence base in the Irish context that the social class mix of a school matters.

This is the largest ever single investment in the DEIS programme and I am proud to be part of the Government that will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.<\/p> <p>Schools have been identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model.  This model uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP deprivation index.  The model was developed through extensive work by the DEIS technical group, which involved valuable input from stakeholders.  Schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.<\/p> <p>This announcement by the Department of Education achieves the programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest numbers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.  The Government will keep working towards an open and welcoming school system in which all students at risk of educational disadvantage will be supported to achieve their full potential.<\/p> <p>I take on board the points the Senator raised regarding Scoil Na Naomh Uilig and I will highlight them with the Minister.  I know the work of Noreen Duggan, the previous principal of the school who the Senator mentioned, the great efforts that happen in that school and the great model it provides in Kildare.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned six schools but there are seven schools in Kildare that have secured DEIS status.  They are Scoil &Iacute;da Naofa, Kilmeade; Scoil na Bhr&iacute;de, Ticknevin; Scoil Bhr&iacute;de, Suncroft; St. Patrick's NS, Morristown in Newbridge; Gaelscoil &Aacute;tha &Iacute; in Athy; Scoil Mhich&iacute;l Naofa, Athy; and St. Conleth's National School in Derrinturn in Carbury.  We recognise increased investment by Government for the provision of education in this schools but will bring back and highlight the point about Scoil Na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#D00200","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I am aware of the seven schools in County Kildare and appreciate the Minister of Education's inclusion of them in the system.

I want to ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, to make a statement on whether he has plans to regulate Airbnb properties to ensure the rental market is not grossly impacted by short-term lettings through Airbnb.<\/p><p>I have raised continuously the lack of realistic regulations on Airbnb.  Airbnb plays a role in the marketplace that is distorting the rental market.  This morning in Kinsale, a town close to my home, 60 properties are on Airbnb for rent, while three are on <i>daft.ie<\/i>.  It is sucking the lifeblood out of the rental market.  We brought in regulations in 2019 that did not address the issue.  They stipulated that people could rent a property for 90 days; otherwise, they had to apply to the local authority.  Nobody has done that.  There has been no active engagement at local authority level to ensure the Airbnb market is regulated.<\/p><p>It is more financially lucrative for people with these properties to rent them out for two or three months per year, and leave them idle for the rest of the time, than to go into the rental market.  The three aforementioned properties on<i>daft.ie<\/i>include a house for &euro;2,700 and an apartment for &euro;1,600.  There is no competition.  The competition is in the Airbnb market and, because of that, people in towns like Kinsale can never rent.  They are dealing with an unregulated entity.  Until we regulate it, this cohort of society will be left with no place to live.  We have spoken continuously about bringing forward regulations.  Bord F&aacute;ilte has looked at this but has not brought anything forward.  It is March, the Airbnb issue will explode in my part of the world in the next few weeks and we have no regulation brought forward.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to comment on another issue brought to my attention during the week.  We have brought forward under the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, a &euro;200 fuel rebate system for people who have an ESB bill.  Every commercial Airbnb property is eligible to get that.  That is sinful.  They do not pay rates but now they get &euro;200 off because they are considered private residents.  They are not; they are commercial properties.  Not alone are we not regulating them, we are giving them a freebie of &euro;200 for the fun of it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a huge issue here.

To have 60 properties in Kinsale is incredible.  I will provide some background and come back to him on the supplementary question on the fuel rebate.<\/p> <p>To provide some background, legislative reforms to regulate the short-term letting sector through the planning code in areas designated as rent pressure zones, RPZs, were introduced under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 which came into effect on 1 July 2019.  The aim of the legislation was to return much-needed accommodation being used for short-term letting purposes in designated RPZs to the long-term rental market, thereby increasing supply in the short-term rental market and helping to stabilise rents in those areas.<\/p> <p>Under the short-term letting legislation, homesharing, that is, the letting of a room or rooms in a person's principal place of residence, is generally permissible on an unrestricted basis.  However, where a person owns a property in a RPZ which is not his or her principal private residence and lets it for short-term letting purposes, he or she is required to apply for change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.  Such change of use in planning permission is not guaranteed in areas of high housing demand.<\/p> <p>Given that short-term letting accommodation is technically tourism-related accommodation, and the regulation of such accommodation is more appropriate to the tourism sector, the Government's Housing for All plan contains a specific action, action 20.4, to develop new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that houses are used to best effect in areas of housing need.  This will take the regulation of short-term letting accommodation out of the planning code.<\/p> <p>The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have lead responsibility for developing and delivering the new legislation in this regard, with input from my Department given its involvement in framing the pre-existing short-term letting legislation.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has engaged with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media to progress this action.  A number of meetings have been held between officials of the Departments and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and further engagement is expected to take place in the near future.<\/p> <p>Funding was allocated in budget 2022 to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which has been tasked with the design and implementation of the new short-term lettings registration system, which requires significant investment in supporting IT infrastructure.  The agency is currently recruiting staff to work on this project.  The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is also scoping out the legislative provisions that will be required to underpin the new registration system with a view to the necessary provisions being enacted in the current year and the new F&aacute;ilte Ireland short-term letting registration system being operational from January 2023.<\/p> <p>As Senator Lombard has suggested, an underlying objective of the new registration system will be to ensure that an adequate level of private rental accommodation can be provided in towns like Kinsale, in particular in urban areas of high housing demand, and that such accommodation is not overly diverted to the short-term letting sector at the expense of local people seeking long-term rental accommodation.  In effect, it is about achieving an appropriate mix of private rental accommodation and short-term letting accommodation, having regard to the housing needs in the area concerned.<\/p> <p>Once again I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I look forward to the introduction of the new legislative provisions in this regard and the positive impact that they will have for the long-term rental sector, in particular, as I have outlined, in those urban areas of high housing demand and need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#E00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.

These regulations need to be brought forward immediately.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State clarify whether Airbnb properties are now in a position to draw down the &euro;200 rebate for energy costs.  I think that is sinful.  Not alone are they taking rental properties out of the market, we are now giving them an opportunity to have a &euro;200 voucher for the two or three months during which they are doing business.  I do not get the logic of that.  The Minister of State might come back to me on that issue.

I know it was criticised in that regard, but it was the most effective and quickest way to do that.  We will find out about the specific issue of people with Airbnb properties.  That is something we need to clarify.<\/p> <p>I wholeheartedly agree with the Senator.  We would love to bring this legislation forward more quickly, but it has to go through a process and it is critically important to get this right.  The Senator is correct in saying that 60 properties in Kinsale is far too many to be in short-term letting and not available for letting on a longer-term basis.  That has an impact on the vibrancy of the town centre, which is contrary to the Town Centre First policy.  It is an issue for people working in Kinsale.  It is an area of high tourism demand and a lot of people working in the services sector would love to be able to rent in the locality.

It is wonderful to have a day where people throughout the world celebrate our country, our nation and our people.  I am really pleased that the Taoiseach has committed to using all the diplomatic engagements that will happen to raise the plight of the people of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise an issue with birth registration.  During the week, a lady contacted me to tell me she was trying to have her baby registered.  She could not get through via the phone line for a number of days.  She was then told that she needed to present at a particular meeting.  However, there is a two-month delay in getting that meeting.  A parent cannot claim child benefit until the baby is registered.  Obviously, the first few months are the most expensive time for new parents.  The system is wrong, in that it is not supporting the parents of newborns in this situation.  It should be possible for somebody to register their child remotely.  We have done so much remotely over the past two years and having to wait two months is simply not good enough.  I ask the Leader to take that up.<\/p> <p>I also raise the issue of emergency tax.  People are coming from abroad to fill urgently needed vacancies in retail and health and are being crucified with emergency tax while they wait for a personal public service, PPS, number.  There are delays in getting their PPS numbers.  It I believe we should do away with the whole notion of emergency tax because that money is eventually paid back anyway.  The cost of living is very high, particularly the cost of accommodation, and we are not helping by having this.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of food security.  I note the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been meeting farming organisations and has committed to set up a group on this.  As an island, we were very self-sufficient.  I spoke to a farmer yesterday who told me about a former Minister for Agriculture standing in his farm and telling him not to bother growing wheat because we would never have a shortage of flour and it is cheaper to import it.  We must do better to address food security.  At the moment, our farmers are getting very mixed messages about the direction they should take.  These directions involve different skill sets etc.  We need to support them to deal with rising fertiliser prices.  That should be an absolute priority for us.<\/p> <p>I express my condolences to the family and friends of Paulina, who died in the Ashbourne House direct provision centre in Cork.

I invite the Minister and Ministers of State from that Department to come to the House once we return after the St Patrick's Day break.  I understand from the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Heydon, that we can expect to see a package of supports being prepared for farmers and finalised by the end of this month.  The farming community is under enormous pressure.  We know the important role farmers have in ensuring we have sufficient food.  We know that the pressure the atrocities in Ukraine is having and will have on food supply particularly relating to grain.  The Ministers met farm organisations on Monday.  There have been meetings throughout the week with feed, fertiliser and fuel importers.  These are the areas that have seen the most significant price rises.  We need to incentivise greater use of certain forage crops.  Obviously, farmers will face significant cash flow pressures.  We need to look at options for flexibility with farm payments as well as working with our EU colleagues on a common European response.  We also need to look at issues such as intervention or aid to private storage for the pig sector to reduce supply to the market as pig producers, along with the poultry sector, have been the most significantly affected sector.  At this stage we do not have an issue with food or feed security, but we need to ensure we do not have one in the autumn and winter.  Preparing for that is very important.  Teagasc will have a key role in that committee.<\/p> <p>I welcome the supports announced by Government yesterday.  Clearly, they have been gobbled up quickly by what in my view was price gouging at petrol stations.  While there are pressures relating to the cost of importing fuel, it is a bit of a coincidence that fuel prices were increasing at petrol stations by 10 cent, 15 cent and 20 cent in certain outlets.  As I said to the Minister yesterday, there will be no thanks for this package because it has been gobbled up so quickly.  However, it is still important and is reducing the excise duty on fuel by one third, 20 cent for petrol and 15 cent for diesel.  There is also a 2 cent reduction in the excise on agricultural fuel.  That is 2 cent out of 4.7 cent, which is a reduction of more than 40% in the excise duty on green diesel.<\/p> <p>We need to acknowledge that we cannot do everything in respect of wholesale prices.  We are an importer and a price taker when purchasing fuels.  I acknowledge the decisions made by the Government.  I know from the Minister that the Government will be keeping this under review in coming weeks and working with our European colleagues in respect of what changes are necessary regarding VAT and other areas to ensure we provide additional supports for important sectors, the hard-pressed homeowners who rely on their cars, the haulage industry and the agriculture sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#K00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Circumstances require me to leave the Chamber but I will try to be back to hear the Leader's response to what I want to raise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In any event, I will pay attention to it.<\/p><p>I want to raise a difficult issue that I do not like bringing up, to be frank, but which has to be spoken about.  That is the plight of women in Ukraine who have been engaged to act as surrogates by Irish couples.  These women are the birth mothers of Irish citizens and of children resident in Ireland.  I think we should all agree that we need to extend every possible assistance to them and offer them shelter in their hour of need.  I have been concerned that although the issue of Irish couples and children stranded in Ukraine has been raised regularly, it seems to me there has been precious little concern shown for the birth mothers.  As I saw one journalist tweeting about it, these children did not materialise out of thin air.  To her credit, I heard Senator Moynihan raise the plight of these women here last week, but unfortunately, the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not address her point on that occasion.  I read last week that Rosanna Davison, whose child was born to a Ukrainian surrogate, has extended the hand of friendship to the birth mother of her child.  She deserves credit for that.  However, I would argue that the question arises as to whether other couples who have engaged a Ukrainian surrogate, either in the past or at present, have a moral duty to the birth mother of their children or whether there should indeed be a legal duty in these situations.  The fact that these women were paid to act as surrogates does not absolve anyone of their moral, or, if we develop it, their legal duty to them, but in any event the State should extend every possible assistance to them at this difficult time.  When these children reach adulthood, we need to be able to look them eye, should we ever meet them, and tell them that we did our best to protect the women who gave birth to them.  In a broader sense, this highlights how we have no legislation in Ireland to protect vulnerable and poor women from possible exploitation or, indeed, from being abandoned or forgotten about, as women in Ukraine now are.<\/p><p>Surrogacy is a moral and ethical minefield.  Countries such as Sweden ban all forms of it because it is viewed as inherently problematic given how it leads to women being taken advantage of and, indeed, children being treated as commodities.  I share that view, although I acknowledge that it is a deeply personal and sensitive issue that demands respect in all our communications around it.  There is a special Oireachtas committee being established to look into this area.  I believe we should follow a similar course to Sweden and give serious consideration to that.  I will try to contribute to that Oireachtas committee in one way or another.  In the meantime, we, as a Seanad, need to speak about the issue openly and respectfully.  We need to address urgently what I and others regard as our moral obligation to women in Ukraine whose lives may be in danger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#K00500","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I have raised in the House before a number of anomalies that exist around broadcasting issues across the island.  While the issue is multifaceted and appears quite complex on the surface, when you actually delve into it with a view to resolving it, it is quite easily done, between technology and a will, if it is there.  I will elaborate slightly.  I raised the issue a number of times in the last Seanad, but this is the first opportunity I have had to raise it in this one.  I refer, for example, to the current bar on audiences from the North entering competitions on RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; will cite legislation in the North that prohibits it from allowing entrants from the Six Counties into what it deems premium level competitions.  I have referred before to the very strange situation where RT&Eacute; was advertising a competition when counties Tyrone and Dublin were in the all-Ireland final to win all-Ireland tickets, get a limousine ride to Croke Park and have a stay in a hotel, yet viewers in County Tyrone could not enter the competition.  It is crazy and it is something that really frustrates people.  It very much happened out of the blue.  RT&Eacute; has said that it came about as result of a review that it conducted.  I met with the Minister for Communities in the North.  Her officials told me they did not interpret the legislation as putting any bar on people in the North from entering competitions in the South.  This seems to have been a unilateral decision, and one that does not really make sense.  In today's <i>Irish News<\/i>, the Minister for Communities, Deirdre Hargey, stated again that her interpretation is that the bar should not be in place.  That is not her officials' advice to her.<\/p><p>Outside of the issue of passports, the one that probably mobilises the most engagement with me on social media is the geoblocking of certain sporting events via satellite providers, including GAA games.  The GAA is an all-Ireland institution; it is the same with the IRFU.  However, there is this mad situation where broadcasting rights are differentiated and sold on that basis.  We also have to encourage the sporting organisations which operate across the entirety of the island to ensure that when they are selling rights to broadcast their games to organisations, such as Sky and Virgin, the island is treated as one entity, so that audiences will not be blocked from watching those important games.  It happened during the Olympics and during big GAA championship matches.  Perhaps located within the context of the shared island work, we could have an update from the relevant Department and Minister on the matter.  That would give me and others an opportunity to delve deeper into the issue.  Perhaps the Leader could consider organising that after the break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#L00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I would like to mention an issue that has been raised by many Senators, namely, the energy crisis that we are dealing with at the moment.  Oil prices, in particular, are reaching nearly &euro;200 a barrel today. I think this is considered to be the largest energy shock we have ever seen in the history of the new world, as they say.  It puts us in a completely different space.  We need to start talking about energy security and where Ireland fits into it with its own energy security policy.  Is it appropriate or logical for us to be importing oil or gas from Russia?  Is that going to be our long-term aim?  We all know there is a renewable policy, but that will not deliver in time for where we are at the moment.  We have our own natural resources.  We have natural resources off the coast of west Cork in the Barryroe oil field that has not been exploited.  A terminal is being proposed for Ballylongford in County Limerick, which is also an important part of the ethos of Ireland.  When natural gas is brought in, it is regarded as a transition fuel between now and 2050.  There is also the potential to extend that gas field currently in operation in County Mayo that produces 40% of our gas.  We need to have a comprehensive debate on how we are going to ensure we can be self-sufficient as possible when it comes to gas and oil going forward to reach our demands between now and 2050.  It is not appropriate for us to put our hands up now and say that we will keep it going by using renewables.  Renewables are part of that process, but they will not feed us going forward.  We are in a new world and regime.  We have seen how the war over the last 16 days has had a huge impact on oil and gas prices.  That is going to be a huge issue for our society.  We need to have a real change in policy when it comes to oil and gas in this country.  We need to exploit whatever resources we have until we get our renewables set up.  That will present very hard choices for some people.  Those choices involve, hopefully, deciding to build an LNG terminal and trying to exploit whatever resources we have to make sure we are self-sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#L00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I, too, want to talk about the energy crisis.  The vote by the Cabinet to reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel was the correct response to a wild and unsustainable fluctuation of price in a commodity which experiences elastic demand.  The idea behind the excise cut is, of course, that the reduction is passed onto the consumer and helps tackle the cost of living, with the implications that if the goal is not achieved, then the cut becomes pointless.  That is exactly what we are in danger of experiencing, as reports flood in from around the country of petrol stations hiking prices in increments of 2 cent and 3 cent over the course of yesterday in order to match the 20 cent and 15 cent cut in the excise duty on unleaded petrol and diesel, respectively.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ultimately, this will mean that the Government will be transferring millions of euro from the future Exchequer not back to the people as intended but to the international corporations and oil and gas companies.

They are going to find out just how high they can lift prices before shoppers begin to punish their bottom lines.  If every petrol station in the country or even the majority engaged in this sort of profiteering, the average consumer would have no choice but to fill their tank at an absolute premium as demand for fuel of this kind is economically elastic and therefore companies are not punished for engaging in despicable behaviour.<\/p><p>While the Government's decision to cut excise duty was correct, additional steps must be taken to ensure the effect of that measure is as intended.  I understand there are limitations at EU level with regard to the energy taxation directive.  However, some form of freeze must be placed on petrol prices to ensure the excise cut is passed on to consumers.  Otherwise Cabinet's olive branch becomes nothing but salt in the wound for ordinary people.  What happened yesterday was absolutely disgraceful.  I was talking to drivers yesterday of 200 lorries from the haulage group who are not going to be in business if there is no freeze on fuel.

I think I speak for the majority of Dublin 15 residents when I ask, bemused and bewildered, what public transport?  We do not have any public transport to the airport, neither public nor private services.  I remind Senators that those travelling from the west via the M4 or anywhere south of the River Liffey are already paying up to &euro;3.20 when they go over the toll bridge at the M50.  Those travellers face a double toll for the luxury of being dropped or collected directly at the airport.<\/p> <p>This measure will not reduce the number of car journeys to the airport.  It simply means the DAA will benefit from an increase in the number of people parking at the terminals and from a penalty for those who do not park there.  Given the uncertainty around fuel prices, this is a tone-deaf move on the part of the DAA and Fingal County Council.  Not only is there no public transport to the airport now for people in Dublin 15; that is not going to change until at least 2024.  I know this because I recently asked for the timings around BusConnects on behalf of people who want sustainable modes of transport to the airport.  The proposed new N8 route under BusConnects from Blanchardstown to the airport is not to be included until the later stages because suitable locations for bus terminals in Blanchardstown and Clongriffin have yet to be identified.<\/p> <p>What about Lucan village?  It is already overwhelmed with traffic and congestion because it is used as a rat run for the M50.  How are two tolls going to impact that?  Is the M50 toll going to be reviewed?  The wider implications of this decision have not been worked through.  The toll is not an exercise in sustainability.  It is a self-serving exercise in revenue raising by the DAA approved by Fingal County Council.  It gives sustainability a bad name.  The only thing green going on here is the colour of the money the DAA will get from this new toll, which needs to be scrapped.

It would be helpful, now that we have a break for the next week or two, if the Minister would engage directly with the affected farmers and workers.  I still have a real concern, which I know is a cross-party one, to ensure that these workers are properly looked after.  The implication I see, having reread the Minister's speech from last week, is that this is something he will look at after the Bill is passed.  I am worried about that.  At that point, these workers will have no leverage.  It behoves the Minister to take the time to meet these people directly.  If the correct assurances are given, we can all be happy and move on as quickly as possible but we need to see those assurances.<\/p> <p>There is some good news from both Limerick and the North.  Limerick City and County Council has invited in the Centre for Local Economic Strategies to talk about community wealth building.  At the same time, the Minister for Communities in the North, my colleague, Deirdre Hargey MLA, has set up an advisory panel on community wealth building.  In essence, this is an entirely new way of directing public spending to ensure it tackles inequality and builds wealth within our communities.  It is a really innovative strategy that has been in practice across a number of districts in Britain and America.  It sees local wealth being generated across our communities by looking at how the State spends money and then spending it differently to ensure good employment practices are taken into account along with the development of co-operative ownership.  It is a radical new way of doing local economics.  I commend my colleague, Councillor Sharon Benson in Limerick, who has won the agreement of all councillors to have a talk about this and see how we can develop it as a strategy.  I commend my colleague in the North, the Minister for Communities, Deirdre Hargey.  I invite all parties to look at community wealth building.

The media is not covering the fact that there are a lot of severe EU constraints on taxation policy and that the Government went as far as it could go.  We do need to go further, however, in particular with the haulage industry, the bus industry and agricultural contractors.  We need to look at expanding the rebate scheme already in place, extending it to agricultural contractors.  We are looking to the farming community to plant more tillage because of what has happened in Ukraine.  Contractors will find it difficult to do that with, first, the lack of supply and, second, the cost.  We should therefore look at allowing agricultural contractors to use the rebate scheme.  As for the bus companies and tour operators, the reality, as I have said here before, is that they cannot claim VAT yet the bus companies in Northern Ireland can and are now outbidding the bus companies here for a lot of the contracts down here.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the announcement by the Minister for Education on additional DEIS schools, in particular two secondary schools in Longford town that were added, St. Mel's College and Me&aacute;n Scoil Mhuire.

Why in some parts of the county can one school be a DEIS school while another school in the same town, pulling in pupils from the same geographical area, is not?  It just does not make sense to me.  That is happening in the area of Granard and Cnoc Mhuire.<\/p> <p>The housing aid for older people grant is very welcome, and significant investment was put in by every local authority and the Government, but the maximum amount under the grant is &euro;8,000.

I have had phone calls from people in Tipperary who saw those increases happen within 24 hours of the suspected announcement and then further changes following the announcement.  That really is shameful when people are to the pin of their collar in being able to afford to just travel to work.

This means it will have to possibly double the number of crews it has.  That will have a massive impact on the overall employee cost for the forthcoming tender.  I estimate the current cost of salaries is about &euro;20 million a year, so I estimate it will go to &euro;30 million or &euro;35 million a year over the duration of the next contract.  We have to try to find out what is going on.<\/p> <p>The second issue relates to the current situation in Ukraine.  We had the report on the future of the Defence Forces and the Department and the Minister said they needed some months to consider it.  Contrast that with what happened in Germany.

I am very much assured that when it comes back to the House the week after next the Minister will give us the assurance that we will all be seeking, particularly with regard to an enhanced redundancy package for the workers in the three farms being closed by the State and a fair and reasonable compensation package for those people whose means of livelihood we are removing.  Senator Gavan also spoke about an interesting concept this morning on community wealth building whereby Limerick County Council is doing a pilot scheme.  That is very welcome.<\/p><p>Senator Currie was speaking my language this morning when she gave out about the new toll for which Dublin Airport Authority has been given planning permission to install in our capital city's airport.  The other day, I was accused of talking about this because apparently it only affects people in Fingal.  As Senator Currie rightly pointed out, people in south and west Dublin are affected as are people in Kildare and Roscommon.  Anywhere and everywhere people are affected by this wrong decision at the wrong time.  It needs to be reversed.  Yesterday, I wrote to the head of the Dublin Airport Authority and the chief executive of Fingal County Council.  We should all do so.  This is the wrong thing at the wrong time.  The sustainability argument is absolutely crass and we can all see it for the money grab that it is.  It needs to be called out.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe spoke about Garda numbers in Galway.  I will certainly organise a debate once we come back.  Senator Keogan asked for a debate on the energy crisis and, more importantly, energy security which is vital.  I fear it is something we will be speaking about weekly in the coming months.  Senator Lombard also spoke about energy security and improving and increasing our natural resources in the country, particularly given the crisis.  This is notwithstanding that we have climate targets.  Everybody needs to realise we are in a wartime response situation.  Not all of the things required under normal circumstances can and will be facilitated.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile brought to light something that is absolutely crazy.  I will certainly bring it to the shared island division of the Taoiseach's Department and ask it to investigate it.  It does not make any sense whatsoever.  The Senator has been asking about this for a while.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen asked for a debate on surrogacy.  That debate will take place in the surrogacy committee being established.  The Senator  made a suggestion I would have to refute, and it is only because I know of the parents who are expecting babies by surrogates in Ukraine and the level of supports they have given them in recent weeks.  They absolutely do care about the surrogates.  It would be wrong for the impression to be given that they are treated as a means to an end.  I can tell the Senator that is not the case.  We hope and expect that surrogacy will be legislated for and the conditions will be debated in the surrogacy committee.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne spoke about the national fodder and food security council and a package of supports to be announced by the Minister at the end of the month.  That is very welcome.  We will keep an eye on it and seek statements and a debate when it is announced.<\/p><p>Senator O'Loughlin spoke about the national greening we normally enjoy on St. Patrick's Day and how it is very apt and appropriate that it is being changed to reflect the situation in Ukraine.  She also spoke about the continuing problem with birth registrations.  I will send a letter to the Minister.  She described how emergency tax affects people and questions the logic of it.  There is probably no logic to it.<\/p><p>I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to indulge me before I finish.  I want to make a contribution today as Leader of the Seanad.  I wish a wonderful lady, one of our very first woman Deputies, Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins, a happy 90th birthday.  She is a former Fine Gael Deputy.  She was first elected to the D&aacute;il in the 1957 general election at the very young age of 24.  Shane Dolphin who works with me tells me she was not even allowed into the bar or the canteen at the time to get a cup of tea because she was a woman.  A man had to go in and get them for her.  There were toilets in the vicinity of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that women were not allowed to use so she used to have to go to Buswells Hotel to use the toilets.  When we speak about giants of women going before us and opening the doors she definitely is one.<\/p><p>Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins's father was Patrick Hogan.  He was one of the first Ministers for Agriculture we had in the Free State.  Brigid was a ferocious constituency worker.  Her husband was also a Deputy and they were the first married couple in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I was regaled with a tale last week whereby he lost his seat and subsequently became the Seanad Leader.  He was appointed to the Seanad by the then Taoiseach.  Because she was a ferocious constituency worker, Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins blamed her husband's lack of constituency work for the loss of his seat.  Perhaps I can concur with that.<\/p><p>Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins's main priorities were agriculture and education.  She was on Liam Cosgrave's Opposition benches as a spokesperson for posts and telegraphs.  She is the only surviving member of the Sixteenth D&aacute;il.  She really is one of those women who broke the glass ceiling long before we were even twinkles in our parents' eyes.  I wish Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins a very happy birthday and continued health and happiness for what I hope will be many years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#O00600","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I concur with the Leader's remarks on Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins and I welcome Shane Dolphin to the Chamber and the Gallery.

On Tuesday, the Government approved my request to seek the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas to opt in to this EU Commission proposal.  The proposal seeks to extend the list of EU crimes under Article 83 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, to include hate crime and hate speech by way of Council decision.  We discussed and approved the proposal in the D&aacute;il yesterday and I am delighted to have the opportunity to present this motion to the Seanad today.  To reiterate the points I made yesterday in the D&aacute;il, hate crime is corrosive of the social solidarity and mutual understanding we need between groups in this increasingly diverse island.  The Government has no hesitation in commending the motion that we opt in.<\/p> <p>Article 83(1) of the TFEU lays down an exhaustive list of areas of crime or EU crimes where the European Parliament and the Council may establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions applicable in all EU member states.  There are a number of areas of crime currently listed.  Trafficking in human beings, illicit drug trafficking and organised crime are three such examples.  Article 83 also provides that, based on developments in crime, the Council may adopt a decision identifying other areas of particularly serious crime that have a cross-border nature, resulting from the nature or impact of such offences, or from a special need to combat them on a common basis.  That is what the Commission is seeking to do with this proposal.  In order to develop a common approach to hate crime and hate speech at EU Level, adoption of a Council decision to extend the list would be a first step to creating the necessary legal basis.<\/p> <p>At European level, unfortunately, hate speech and hate crime are widespread across the Union and have been increasing over recent years.  In particular, the Covid-19 pandemic has heightened the feelings of insecurity, isolation and fear.  This has created an atmosphere in which hate speech has flourished, while being also used to target already marginalised populations, also resulting in hate crimes.  As Members know, Ireland does not currently have any specific legislation to deal with hate crime.  The only legislation in Ireland that deals with hate-based offences is the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.<\/p> <p>The general scheme of the criminal justice (hate crime) Bill 2021 was published in April 2021.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This proposed new legislation will create specific, hate-aggravated forms of existing offences that can be investigated, prosecuted and recorded as hate crimes.  The proposed Bill will also provide for new offences of incitement to hatred, which should prohibit deliberately or recklessly inciting hatred against a person or group of people due to their association with a protected characteristic or displaying or distributing material inciting hatred.  This will also have relevance to online hate speech.<\/p><p>Following its publication, the general scheme was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  This took place in November and the report is awaited.  The general scheme has also been referred to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  I intend to publish the new hate crime Bill in the summer, subject to the committee's report of its deliberations.<\/p><p>We have traditionally been very cautious about regulating hate speech.  This is because any restrictions on speech are very serious.  I am very committed to ensuring that the legislation we introduce domestically is completely in harmony with the very important right to freedom of expression, which we all have a right to enjoy.  When we think of hate speech and our own freedoms, however, we should remember that there is nothing noble or free about hate speech; instead, there are people who have been the victims of a crime and an attempt to sow hatred in our society.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that opting in to the proposed decision does not create any constitutional or legal issues for the State.<\/p><p>Any directives proposed as a result of the expansion of Article 83 to include hate crime and hate speech will be carefully examined in detail.  However, the State by opting in now will be part of those detailed discussions in Brussels and we will have an opportunity to consider whether we should be included in any such new proposed directive as Protocol 21 will apply also.<\/p><p>There are people in this country who live in fear.  They are afraid to leave their houses, get public transport and live their lives.  That might seem extreme or like I am exaggerating, but before we published the hate crime legislation we did extensive consultation and engaged with Departments, State agencies and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, NGOs and community groups, along with asking individuals to come forward and tell their stories.  There are people living in this country who are afraid to go about their daily lives and we need to respond to that not just as a national level but also through this legislation.<\/p><p>We have seen how this has taken a severe direction across the EU.  More recently, a man was radicalised online, at home in his room on his computer, to the extent that he went out and beheaded a teacher because of hate language and speech and radicalisation that happened online.  We need to be very quick and responsive in what we do here nationally and make sure that we work collectively together to combat hate speech which inevitably leads to these type of hate crimes.<\/p><p>I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#R00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I would like to start where she finished because what is really important about this debate that we recognise it is not academic.  The reality is that there are people who suffer hugely from the behaviour of others in terms of hate speech and, ultimately, hate crime.  I regret to say that I have been involved in a case in the criminal courts involving activities that undoubtedly constitute hate crime but that are not properly defined in our laws.  I welcome the proposed legislation the Minister has said is coming.  The Joint Committee on Justice examined the general scheme of the hate crime Bill.  I also recognise that existing legislation regarding incitement to hatred is undoubtedly out of date and has been underused throughout its lifetime.  It is appropriate that we recognise the seriousness of this issue, the effect it has on individuals and the fact it requires specific legislation to enunciate it.<\/p> <p>In terms of the motion and what is happening in respect of Article 83(1), it is also worth noting that the existing crimes set out in Article 83(1), namely, terrorism, trafficking human beings, the sexual exploitation of women and children, illicit drug trafficking, illicit arms trafficking, money laundering, corruption, counterfeiting of means of payment, computer crime and organised crime.  They are all serious matters.<\/p> <p>It is, to my mind, appropriate that the matters we are talking about today, namely hate speech and hate crime, join that list because they have, as the Minister said, a corrosive effect on social understanding.  That is at the core of this debate.  I would like to think that in Ireland we have people who understand other nationalities and ethnicities and people who are different, and welcome them into their part of society.  However, when we realise that is, we hope, the case for most people, it is not the case for all and we need to put in place very strong legislative instruments while being conscious of what the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has said to all Members.  I note its comments.  We need to put in place strong legislative measures that make sure that people who transgress the boundaries of what is acceptable face the rigours of the law and are held accountable before the courts as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#S00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the opportunity to address this motion.  I want to begin by applauding all that she is doing.  A panoply of legislation to deal with gender-based violence will in every way ensure a safer society because the fact is that she is absolutely right.  It is almost incredible, unless one happens to be involved in or aware of a case and supporting a community, to realise that there are people who are afraid in their own homes and whose homes are consistently attacked because of their race or religion or because they are a member of a minority group<\/p> <p>.  It is important that we address hate crime.  I welcome in advance the Bill that will come through later in the year.  We need it at an EU level.  I recognise the research from the European Commission which showed that 52% of young women and girls have experienced online violence, threats and sexual harassment, while people with disabilities are more at risk of being victims of violent crime, including hate crimes, than other persons.  There are protected groups under our laws because they are targets and experience discrimination due to the fact they deal with particular biases and attitudes.  To have a definition on an EU basis and a common approach across the European Union is incredibly valuable.  It shows a desire and ethos in the EU to make sure that freedom of expression is balanced by the responsibilities that come with that.<\/p> <p>People are entitled to hold their opinions, but they are not entitled to affect the quality of life of any other person.  We need to ensure that, in terms of those who are vulnerable and susceptible to being influenced online or in groups, there are measures to arrest those who choose influence and target.  Now more than ever we see how social media is used and deployed in a way that is propaganda based to undermine society and democracies.  We can see that happening in real time at the moment in terms of false news.  In the past 24 hours there has been an allegation of false news regarding a maternity hospital.  All of these things can be targeted and deployed in a very sinister way.  Having hate crime and hate speech defined across all European Union member states and sanctioned in the same way is absolutely correct, and I am very proud of the EU for moving to do that.  I thank the Minister for all of her work on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#S00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Everybody opposes hate crime and hate speech.  The problem is that everyone thinks they know what hate speech is, such as a gang of football hooligans hurling racist abuse at individuals on a street or a boy or girl who is made to feel small and unwelcome because of his or her appearance.  The thing about hate speech legislation is that it governs much more than these clear-cut cases.<\/p> <p>What about statements of fact?  If I said most shoplifters are women, I do not know if that is true.  If it is true, would that be hate speech towards women?  What if I replaced the word \"women\" with a different definable group of people?  What if we changed the crime?  Will I still be allowed to make that statement if it was true?  What if I simply wanted to talk about my deeply held beliefs, which some people choose to be affronted by?  It is not a hypothetical.<\/p> <p>In Finland last month, a Member of Parliament was taken to court and faced up to two years in prison for the crime of ethnic agitation.  Her crime was tweeting a picture of the Bible.

If an idea is hateful or repugnant, our sensibilities will allow it to die and arguments against it will show it to be false.  Rather than mandating consensus, let us keep speech free and have ideas live or die by their merit.  <\/p><p>If we do not keep free speech in this country, we will be on a very slippery slope.

Along with others, we have consistently called for action to be taken in this area.  I compliment my colleague, Senator O'Loughlin, who has been very proactive in this particular area and who has introduced legislation that would go a long way towards dealing with this particular problem.  It is saddening and worrying that hate speech and hate crime are on the rise and getting nastier with each passing day.  That is a very worrying and very sad development.  Unfortunately, there is no provision to criminalise hate speech at an EU level.  As I understand it, this motion is the first step along the road towards the introduction of legislation in this regard.  Once this has passed through all the EU states, a number of states will then be able to bring in legislation that will go some way towards addressing this particular issue.<\/p> <p>We will absolutely have to legislate in this particular area but I feel that national awareness campaigns not only in this country, but in countries across the EU, such as many have called for, may be necessary to educate people on this whole area.  It is sad that we should have to do that but, unfortunately, it appears that we do.  In this country, we have to start in our schools.  We need to educate people.  There is no doubt that there are many benefits to social media but there is also a sickening element.  As has been outlined in contributions this afternoon, many people have been victims of that.

In saying that, I am responding to Senator Keogan's remarks.  Hate crimes are message crimes.  They are intended to target entire communities.  The victims are targeted because of their identity.  The impact goes beyond the individual.  There is also an impact on communities and on society.  We need to send a strong message that we will absolutely not tolerate hate crime or hate speech.  My party certainly supports this motion.  We appreciate the Minister bringing it before us as we appreciate that she has prioritised legislation on hate crime here within our own country.  We have been consistent advocates in the area of hate crime.  I have twice introduced legislation in this regard, once in the D&aacute;il and once in the Seanad, over the past five years.<\/p> <p>It is important to commend the President of the European Commission, Dr. von der Leyen, on her initiative with regard to extending the list of EU crimes to include hate speech and hate crime, which she outlined in her 2020 state of the Union speech.  It has been awful to see the rise of hate speech and hate crime right across Europe.  It is a particularly serious and worrying phenomenon, both offline and online.  There is no doubt that we need common EU action to tackle this challenge.  <\/p> <p>Ireland is behind the curve in that we are one of the last countries in the western world to legislate in this area.  There is no doubt that there is an urgent need for progressive and rigorous hate crime legislation in our system because, in its absence, we are leaving vulnerable groups, such as those from ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and members of the LGBT community, without proper protection.  We acknowledge and welcome the work the Minister has been doing and the work of the Joint Committee on Justice in this area.  The fact that we do not have the stringent hate crime legislation that is needed is not reflective of the reality of life in modern Ireland.  The theme of this year's International Women's Day was breaking the bias and we are still within that week.  If the harm of hate is to be acknowledged and countered, it falls to us as legislators to act to provide a legislative framework for the explicit naming of bias crime.  We have to join with other nations in ensuring that the violence of hate experienced by vulnerable individuals and communities is met head-on.  <\/p> <p>The reasons people have been attacked on the grounds of their identity are diverse in nature but they share one commonality; the victims of hate crime are targeted because of their identity.  We need to do absolutely everything we can to stop that because diversity in our country is a strength but, sadly, not everybody has welcomed that strength or the changes we have experienced.  Some people see diversity as a threat to themselves and are willing to engage in violence to maintain exclusion.  The Minister has provided an example but there are plenty around.

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to discuss the situation in Ukraine and, once I deliver my brief remarks, I am going to attend that meeting, so I apologise for not being here to hear the Minister's response.  I always find it really enlightening when people lay out potential scenarios in respect of the likes of this.  They have the freedom to come in and talk about it.  There is no suggestion that what is happening in Finland is going to happen here as a result of the motion and the legislation the Minister will subsequently introduce.  Again, people have a right to protest and to free speech.  As Senator O'Loughlin rightly said, it is when there is a victim or when someone is hurt or impacted as result of speech that it crosses a line.<\/p> <p>The thinking behind this motion is to create a more inclusive and protective Europe.  Its intention is to expand the list of EU crimes to include hate speech and hate crime.  The list of EU crimes is already extensive.  Colleagues have referred to these crimes.  Passing this motion will add to that already comprehensive list.  The extension of the list will cover all forms of hate crime and hate speech, whether based on race, religion, gender or sexuality.  These are laudable objectives which Sinn F&eacute;in can support but it would be useful if the Minister were to outline what the Bill will look like and what the interaction between domestic and EU law will be with regard to eradicating hate crime.  Support for this motion in the Seanad will pave the way for the European Council to take the initial steps required to establish the legal basis needed to create a legal framework to combat hate speech and hate crime across the EU.  The setting of minimum standards with regard to crimes with cross-border implications makes sense as we live in a connected world.  In addition to this State being seen as a tax haven and a carbon emissions haven for corporations, there is a risk that we might also be viewed as being weak on hate speech on social media.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The minimum standards the motion aims to set out should combat this.

That is welcome but it is slightly alarming that it takes an EU-wide initiative by President von der Leyen to bring us up to speed in an area in which we have lagged behind for some time.  The UN rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination has been sharply critical of Ireland's foot-dragging with regard to the absence of hate crime legislation.  Following on from what Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said, we look forward to the detail and to the point when our legislation complements what is emerging from the European Union, as opposed to forming the basis for an impression that the only ideas are coming from the European Union at this time.<\/p> <p>We understand that legislating for hate crime and hate speech is complex but the need to protect victims of these appalling crimes must override other concerns.  We can express our concern about people being victimised because of the colour of their skin, their ethnic origin, their identity or any other factor.  That is appalling but, unless we do something about it, we are not doing enough.  I am struck that the garda&iacute; are ahead of our legislation in that they have implemented their own working definition of \"hate crime\".  In 2019, a staggering 250 crimes were deemed to be motivated by hate.  <\/p> <p>I pay tribute to the work of certain organisations which have campaigned for this for many years.  The Irish Council of civil Liberties and the Irish Network Against Racism have been leading voices calling for Ireland to have hate crime and hate speech legislation.  Academics in the University of Limerick produced the report A Life Free from Fear - Legislating for Hate Crime in Ireland, which has been important in educating us on what needs to be put in place.<\/p> <p>We support the motion, look forward to the Bill this summer and would like to see the detail as soon as possible.  For the victims the Minister spoke so eloquently about, we need to see this legislation in place as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#U00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the general support for the Bill, albeit some concerns have been raised.  I reassure everybody in the House that in no way will the national legislation or the legislation we propose to opt into at a European level get in the way of everybody's right to free speech.  It is vital that freedom of expression continues but where speech incites or encourages others to commit crimes against a person or group of people because of who they are, the colour of their skin, their gender, their sexual orientation, because they have a disability or otherwise, it crosses the line.  We need a clear line.  There should be an ability for people to say what they want and express themselves but where that crosses the line and other people are hurt, it cannot be tolerated.<\/p> <p>I have no hesitation in commending the motion that we opt into this proposal to the House.  As is the case with most of these motions, if we do not opt in within the first three months, we can do so at a later date but will not have the opportunity to engage in the various elements that will follow.  It is important we are around the table and show that Ireland is fully behind the European approach, particularly that of our French colleagues who proposed this and want to see it passed during their term.<\/p> <p>As we open our doors to those fleeing hate in their countries, we need to make sure that when they come here we are determined to show those who seek to promote hate that it will not be tolerated.<\/p> <p>Some Senators have mentioned the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is improving its structures and systems as to how hate crime and hate speech is recorded at a national level.  It has accepted that, regarding hate-based motivation for crime in previous annual reports, there is under-reporting.  One thing we would like to see out of the national legislation is that more people come forward.  It is about making sure we have laws we can implement.  The law from 1989 is not really used because it cannot be implemented in the way we need.  We want to ensure that people come forward because they have confidence that there will be prosecutions and that what happens to them will be taken seriously.<\/p> <p>Times are changing and this legislation at a national and EU-level recognises that hate crimes, hate speech, racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism know no boundaries.  With the introduction of online platforms, the way we can communicate with each other is fantastic but it means this type of behaviour can spread more quickly and more people can be negatively impacted.  <\/p> <p>I thank Senators for their support and I look forward to engaging with them again when we bring forward national legislation and to having further discussions about what happens at a European level.  <\/p> <p>On the link between the two, this is an enabling measure, initially, at a European level.  When we see the detail of what will be included at a future date, we will examine that in further detail.  We want to make sure this lines up with what we are doing at a national level so we are in sync with our partners across the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#U00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646908200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#U00500","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1646908200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>At 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022031000002#U00600","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646908200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar athl&oacute; ar 1.48 p.m. go dt&iacute; 2.30 p.m., D&eacute; M&aacute;irt, an 22 M&aacute;rta 2022.<\/p><p>The Seanad adjourned at 1.48 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 March 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
