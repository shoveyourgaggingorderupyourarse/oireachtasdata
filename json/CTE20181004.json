Responsibility for the fund had moved from one Department to another and then another.  It ended up being nobody's child in the sense that nobody wanted to take responsibility for it.  Meanwhile, because there was no sunset clause, money that had been committed was locked up and could not be used.

Normally, we note ten or 20 every week but, due to the summer period, members will have to bear with me.  I will move through them as fast as I can, although it does not sound too bad.  There are 70 financial statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which has 40 Votes for each of the State bodies.  That is one composite document, but there are approximately 70.  If some members have issues, we can hold over a particular one for a later date, but we will try to move on them as fast as we can.  We will give it a few minutes and then come back to our work programme before we go into public session.  All of these have been received over the summer period.<\/p> <p>  The first one is 4.1, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, clear audit opinion.  It assesses compensation entitlements in personal injury claims.  The next is 4.2, Enterprise Ireland, clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to expenditure where the procurement procedures did not comply with public procurement guidelines.  I suspect it will not be the only public body about which that remark will be made.  I am marking that one.  Enterprise Ireland's annual turnover for 2017 is &euro;350 million.  The next is 4.3, Solas, funding of &euro;603 million.  It plans and co-ordinates further education and training.

There is a clear audit opinion in respect of Kingdom Greyhound Racing Company Limited.  Obviously, we are dealing with a lot of bodies that are subsidiaries of Bord na gCon.  There are clear accounts in respect of Cork Greyhound Racing Company Limited, Clonmel Racing Company Limited and Limerick Greyhound Racing Track Limited.  Abergrove Limited, Bord na gCon's food and beverages operation, is a separate company, in respect of which there is a clear audit opinion.  There is also a clear audit opinion in respect of Galway Greyhound Stadium Limited and Dublin Greyhound and Sports Association Limited.  The latter company ceased trading in February 2017.  Agreement was reached for the sale of Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium for a sum of &euro;23 million which, coincidentally, was sufficient to allow the company to discharge its residual liabilities.  I think it was sold to the Department of Education and Skills.  People in Dublin will be more familiar with the issue.

The figure came to &euro;14.4 million.  When we discussed this item previously, I raised the issue of where a company was dissolved but there was a residual asset.

The risk equalisation fund, for people wondering what it is, is a fund that concerns the age mix and profile of customers of the three private health insurers in the market.  VHI probably has older customers, so there is a transfer of funds, approved by the Health Insurance Authority, from Laya Healthcare and the other insurer, the name of which I cannot recall at the moment, to VHI which equalises the risk across the industry.

There are many schemes concerning them with names such as  the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and others that make it difficult to follow.  There are also various types of tenancies.  My understanding is that one got a local authority house or one could seek a house from an approved housing body.  The only distinction in the past is that one could buy out the local authority house but one could never buy out the other one.

Its primary function is to provide education, training, advisory and research services to the agriculture and food industries and to rural communities.<\/p> <p>  The Teagasc financial statements before the committee this morning relate to 2017.  They are consolidated statements incorporating the results of the Teagasc subsidiary Moorepark Technology Limited, in which the authority has a majority shareholding.  The financial statements record total income of &euro;183 million.  Over three quarters of Teagasc's income is accounted for by direct Oireachtas grants.  The bulk of the remainder comprises advisory service and course fee income, research grants and commissions, and trading income from Teagasc's own farming operations, including the sale of livestock.<\/p> <p>  The authority's expenditure for 2017 totalled &euro;178 million, and is detailed in notes 7 and 8 to the financial statements.  As the figure in the presentation indicates, pay, pensions and other staff costs accounted for two thirds of the expenditure.  Other expenditure related to Teagasc's operations, including depreciation, amounted to &euro;50 million or 28% of the total.  Grants of various kinds accounted for &euro;10.2 million, or 6%.  The operating surplus for the year was just over &euro;5 million.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the financial statements for 2017.

The Teagasc mandate, as set out in the 1988 Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, comprises three components, namely, \"to provide or procure educational, training, and advisory services in agriculture\"; \"to obtain and make available to the agricultural industry the scientific and practical information in relation to agriculture required by it\"; and \"to undertake, promote, encourage, assist, co-ordinate, facilitate and review agricultural research and development (including research and development in relation to food processing and the food processing industry).\"<\/p> <p>  In regards to governance, the Teagasc authority is accountable to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and is responsible for ensuring good governance through setting strategic objectives and targets and by taking strategic decisions on all key business issues.  The day-to-day management, control and direction of Teagasc are the responsibility of the director and the senior management team.<\/p> <p>  Teagasc fully adheres to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and adheres to all circulars emanating from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Teagasc's system of internal control is supported by its audit and risk committee, comprising three authority members, one of whom serves as chair, another is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's representative on the authority and there is also an external member with significant financial and audit expertise.  The audit and risk committee is supported by an internal audit function which reports to it.  The authority's operations committee provides oversight on the effectiveness and efficiency of all Teagasc's administrative functions.<\/p> <p>  Teagasc maintains regular contact with the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine on administrative and programme matters.  At the end of each year, a business plan for the year ahead is approved by the authority and a oversight agreement, OA, based on this plan is agreed with the Department.  The OA is regularly reviewed by the Department in consultation with Teagasc.  Each year, as required under the 1988 Act, Teagasc also submits a proposed annual programme of activities for review to the Department.  Teagasc also operates a rigorous performance and evaluation system involving external peer reviews of all of its programme as well as the monitoring and tracking of key performance indicators.<\/p><p>The mission of Teagasc, as adopted by the authority, is to support science-based innovation in the agrifood sector and the wider bioeconomy to underpin profitability, competitiveness and sustainability.  The Teagasc authority has adopted four goals.  These are to improve the competitiveness of agriculture, food and the wider bioeconomy to encourage diversification of the rural economy and enhance the quality of life in rural areas; to support sustainable farming and the environment; and to enhance organisational capability and deliver value for money.<\/p><p> Teagasc has six operational programmes.  These are animal grassland research and innovation; food research; crops, environment and land use; rural economy and development; advisory and extension; and education and training.  In addition, Teagasc has a central administration service embracing finance, HR, ICT and corporate service functions.  Teagasc is a national organisation with sites distributed throughout every county in the country.  It has 51 advisory offices, which is down from 90 following a recent rationalisation programme.  It also has four colleges of further education and seven research centres.<\/p><p> In regard to finances, Teagasc is obliged each year to match its expenditure with its income.  It is unique as a non-commercial body in having a relatively large proportion of non-grant-in-aid, GIA, income, some &euro;56 million in 2017.  This non-GIA income comprises grants awarded to Teagasc as a result of success in competitions for research and advisory funds at national and EU level, advisory and education fees, farm operations, industry levies and the sale of various professional services.  In 2017, Teagasc received &euro;125 million grant-in-aid, including &euro;43 million for pensions, to meet its current expenditure needs and a further capital grant of &euro;3.15 million.  Turning to capital requirements, in the absence of access to borrowing facilities, Teagasc faces significant challenges in funding its working capital requirements.  This issue has become more acute in recent years as Teagasc&rsquo;s non-grant-in-aid income has increased significantly.<\/p><p> Similarly, in the absence of a borrowing facility, longer-term capital funding for our research and educational infrastructure is even more challenging.  Teagasc&rsquo;s grant-in-aid earmarks a relatively small amount of funding for infrastructural purposes which is only sufficient to partially cover maintenance costs and undertake some minor capital works.  More substantial infrastructural needs are funded as the opportunity arises through the sale of assets that are no longer programme priorities, or through once-off special capital grants from Government.  Reliance on asset sales as a funding mechanism is not a sustainable basis on which to fund ongoing infrastructural needs.  While the availability of special capital grants is welcome, the process results in an episodic funding schedule.<\/p><p> Teagasc received an unqualified audit certificate in 2017, but the Comptroller and Auditor General did draw attention to some procurement issues.  Teagasc is making every effort to be as fully compliant as possible in regard to its procurement practices.  Significant improvement in procurement procedures has been implemented in recent years through the recruitment of specialist staff and the development of robust systems.  It should be noted that procurement in Teagasc is complex due to our diversified activities and the geographical dispersal of our sites.  The issues reported in the financial statements were discovered and brought to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General by Teagasc.<\/p><p> In the main, the reported matters were due to two factors.  The first was quotes being sought from a number of local suppliers rather than advertising through eTenders.  We are satisfied that this did not adversely impact value for money, given the number of quotes sought and the type of services procured.  The second factor was the extension of existing contracts for services where the requirement was being reviewed, where there were delays in the implementation of the Office of Government Procurement process or where a similar service had been procured from that supplier.  While no breaches can be tolerated, it is noted that the breaches amounted to tender values of &euro;1.35 million out of a total expenditure of &euro;42 million, or 3.2%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538640000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Boyle for his opening statement.

The second point is that attention should be focused on the surplus for the financial year, which is lower down the column on the page Deputy Deering is referring to, under note 11.  The surplus declined from &euro;6.152 million to &euro;2.398 million.  There is a simple reason for that.  We do not expect, normally, to have a surplus, but in recent years we have had significant difficulty in trying to manage cashflow.  We sought leave to put in place an overdraft facility but permission was not forthcoming from our parent Department or from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The decision was taken then to try to build up a capital reserve to be able to meet our recurrent capital requirements on a sustainable basis.  In 2016, we were able, through prudent management, to generate such a surplus.  I want to emphasise that would not be the norm-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1538640000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Is it a rainy day fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#P00500","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538640000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Yes, that is it precisely.  We felt that was a prudent thing to do because we were quite concerned about our ability to manage cashflow in a prudent way.  The Department did support us in this respect.  In 2017, because this is an opportunistic type of activity, the same opportunity did not generate itself because of demands on current expenditure.  The &euro;2.398 million surplus is broken down roughly between &euro;1 million from the capital side of our activities - we did not spend as much as we thought we would on capital - and the other &euro;1.83 million from the current budget side.  In summary, it is unusual to have any surplus but there is a reason we have a surplus.

Sometimes Teagasc is criticised unfairly - and the Deputy might say that I would say that - for advocating an unsustainable expansion strategy.  We did nothing of the kind.  Time and again, we told farmers to look to their own farm gate first and improve their efficiency before increasing their cow numbers.  That message does not always get across, especially in a rapidly changing situation where farmers who may have been used to providing fodder for 50, 60 or 70 cows took a chance and doubled their cows over a couple of years.

Without the basic payment scheme, farmers could not survive on the income levels from suckler farming.  According to the Teagasc national farm survey, the typical family income from a suckler farm is about &euro;10,000.  That mainly involves the basic payment to the farmer.  Clearly there is a viability issue.  When one analyses the problem it is not difficult to explain why it is at that level.  There is quite a spread of people engaged in suckler farming.  Very few of them would be full-time, commercial type farmers.  Many of these farmers are older people who perhaps are stepping down from a career in dairy farming or the fattening of animals and they like to be involved in farming.  A lot of them are part-time farmers whose livelihood is not dependent on the income from their suckler enterprise.  It is, therefore, a very challenging area.  There is no escaping the fact that this has not happened today or yesterday.  I am in this business a fair long time now at this stage, and we have always had this problem within the suckler industry.  The fattening sector is a little better but it is highly variable.  The suckler industry, however, has a huge difficulty.<\/p> <p>  Teagasc tries to emphasise that we can have a win-win pathway for dry stock farmers from dairy, but it will take a while for a mindset change.  There are huge opportunities, for example, for dry stock farmers who are expert at managing cattle and herding to rear young animals.  There is already a small number of farmers engaging in that and they are doing very well.  We also believe there are opportunities for farmers to fatten animals coming off the dairy herd, which was much more common prior to the dairy quota.  There are far fewer animals coming off the dairy herd, for example, beef animals, than we had before the dairy quota.  There are opportunities there and rather than this false antagonism between dairy and the rest, we should be trying to see how income earning opportunities can be complemented as dairying is moving forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1538640000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>What is Professor Boyle's general opinion on the beef data and genomics programme?

For this reason, we have undertaken research to identify the underlying behaviour that causes a man or woman to do something on the farm that he or she knows is hazardous.<\/p> <p>  There is particular concern at the moment with regard to elderly farmers.  Unfortunately, a lot of the tragic accidents in recent times involved elderly farmers, some of them aged 80 plus, overturned tractors and livestock.  The reason for this is, we think, pretty obvious.  Many young people are taking up jobs off-farm and leaving management of the farm to their elderly relatives.  This is an area on which we intend to increase our focus.  We also work closely with the Department and other bodies such as the FBD Trust, which has a major farm safety programme, and the committees within the farm organisations.  We have been talking about this issue for a long time.  Unfortunately, the statistics are still moving in the wrong direction.  I do not know the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1538640000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>On the increase of &euro;403,000 in travel and subsistence which the Comptroller and Auditor General referenced in his opening remarks, what was the reason for that increase?

That seems to me to be contradictory so perhaps Professor Boyle might clarify what he meant by that.<\/p> <p>  On the wage bill where two thirds of the budget goes on pay and pensions, I understand that it is not the same model as any business but could someone outline how this compares internationally, perhaps with the United Kingdom equivalent?  Is it normal to have two thirds of the total spend going on pensions and wages?<\/p> <p>  On the 18,000 ha of land owned by Teagasc, will someone tell me what percentage of that is in forestry?  Is that managed by Coillte or Teagasc?<\/p> <p>  One of the speakers asked about who decided what assets to sell.  We did not get an answer on that.  We were talking about the Kinsealy site.  Who prioritised what lands should be disposed of in that rationalisation programme and is there a list of those assets anywhere?<\/p> <p>  On the fodder crisis, in relation to which we have had a number of incidents in the past year, many of the EU directives refer to farming by calendar.  During the summer at the start of the good weather in July, in areas of Ireland such as the west and the midlands, many farmers wanted to cut hay early.  As it turned out the weather stayed good longer than anticipated and it all worked out well in the end.  Will Professor Boyle give his view on the wisdom of farming by calendar while on the other hand speaking about erratic climate incidents?  It does not make sense to me that on the one hand there are rigid timeframes for cutting silage or hay or spreading slurry and then on the other hand to say that weather changes and it is unlikely to be a one-off, as one of the witnesses said earlier.  If we look to the future of farming, that incident caused a lot of stress to farmers over the summer months because they were worrying about the winter ahead of their animals.<\/p><p>Is there anything the professor can suggest that we can do to mitigate some of that concern and worry?<\/p><p> The professor said - maybe I misinterpreted him - that most farms could double their grass output, which would obviously offset a fodder incident.  Could he give us some examples of how he is getting down to the grassroots farmers?  I am sure it is like anything in that it is probably those who need it the most do not engage in the process.  Could the professor speak to that?<\/p><p> On the six research facilities, I would imagine that these facilities do a lot of work with disease control and testing.

At present, this is the only way we see of doing that.<br\/><br\/>As to the question on pay and pensions, I do not have the comparable figure for international organisations, but my strong view would be, from my knowledge of these organisations, that we are very similar.  A research organisation is people-heavy, so to speak.  All our research staff would be at PhD level, so there would tend to be on higher grade salaries relative to the rest of the public sector.  I do not have the data at present, but bodies like Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, INRA, or Scotland's Rural College, SRUC, Rothamsted in the UK or any of these bodies would have a very similar structure.<br\/><br\/>On the forestry area, we do not have that information, but I will get that for the committee.  We have forests on a lot of our sites.  In Moorepark, we have a small forest area around the periphery on the Dungarvan-Lismore Road, and significant forestry in Oak Park.  The Deputy is probably aware that a number of years ago the Teagasc authority, with the consent of the Government, handed over a forest and lake area for recreational purposes to the people of Carlow.  There is about 50 ha involved in that, but we also have forest on site.  We have forest in Ballyhaise and in Johnstown Castle.  We conduct a certain amount of research on those activities.  We can extract that figure for the Deputy, by site.<br\/><br\/>On the question of who decides to sell the assets, the process is well set out.  During the rationalisation programme that issue obviously came to a head.  The management proposed a series of criteria by which assets would be sold.  We were dealing with a particular challenging period in the financial history of the country, so there was an absolute necessity to rationalise, which was the context.  Management proposed a series of criteria on which, for example, an advisory office would be closed.  As one might expect, that included the usage of the office the farmers in the hinterland and the state and age of the office and so on.  Then, the authority adopted these criteria, following consultation, and we came forward with a list of properties that were deemed suitable to sell.  The authority decided <i>en bloc<\/i>and stuck with that decision.  Given the number of offices we have around the country, it is a very difficult thing to sell even one office.  By having a set of criteria, we managed to get buy-in for the entire suite of rationalisation, including the sale of the Kinsealy offices.  That was the basis and it had to be approved subsequently by the Ministers.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised a very difficult question on farming by calendar.  The popular view among some farmers is that we should move to farming by calendar. One might think that is the sensible way to go.  My colleagues, when they have looked at this, found that it can give rise to unexpected implications.  It is not as straightforward as it might seem.  I believe that the current system, while it has disadvantages, is useful.  This year is a good example, where the Minister has been able to exercise flexibility in how it is implemented.  We have the best of both worlds.  One thing that is very important here is there is at least certainty with the current system.  People know exactly on what day they have to cease spreading slurry and what day they can commence.  That is useful for a lot of people.  If there is a crisis situation, where that does not make sense, one needs the flexibility and, by and large, it has been demonstrated.  There a number of ways one could view that issue.  I do not think it is entirely straightforward.<br\/><br\/>On the point I made on the potential to grow grass, it is a massive challenge.  It is one our key performance indicators, KPIs, and we track that each year.  We have a trend now.  While there has been growth in grass utilisation, it has not been as we would have liked.  It has grown over the last three or four years, averaging out the extremes.  It is a huge puzzle because our research colleagues estimate that every extra tonne of grass utilised is worth about &euro;180 per hectare for a dairy farmer and about &euro;105 for a beef farmer.  What are we doing about it?<br\/><br\/>We have a number of programmes in place in recent years.  We have invested a lot in developing a whole methodology for measuring grass.  On the front of our report, there is a photograph of colleagues engaged in that activity.  We have set up a programme called PastureBase Ireland.  This allows us to track grass growth performance right around of the country.  With that information, we can benchmark.  If one is a farmer in west Tipperary and is interested in what one's colleagues in east Limerick are doing, a comparison can be made with their performance.  Benchmarking has proved to be a useful tool to improve performance.  That data is published regularly and is very much like a weather map and has been very useful in the last year, in particular, in tracking the impact of the fodder situation, because grass growth diminished particularly during the drought.  That is one tool.  This is an example of precision agriculture at work in the dairy sector, in particular, although the technology can be used elsewhere.  We can learn a huge amount from that information.  It is unique worldwide and we are talking to the New Zealanders and the Australians about using that technology.  Hopefully, they will buy it off us.<br\/><br\/>We also have a programme in place to promote the utilisation of grass more aggressively.  It is called Grass 10 and we are in the second year of a four year programme.  The ten stand for a target of ten tonnes, utilised grass per hectare, which is a little less ambitious than what I said, but it is considered to be a reasonable target.  Ten also stands for the number of grazings that we would advocate farmers to conduct during the season, because there is a high correlation between grazings and production and utilisation.  That is strongly supported by the Department and is also supported by a number of companies.<\/p><p>The biggest challenge we face as an organisation is to persuade farmers to adopt these kinds of technologies with regard to grass in particular.  I will give the committee an example.  As I said, there are two main technologies that we have been promoting within Teagasc.  One is breeding technology.  There has been huge success in this area as we have been working with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and the artificial insemination companies.  The adoption of the economic breeding index, EBI, has been very successful, for example.  Grassland faces a massive challenge and we have not yet cracked how we can encourage farmers to make the transition to what is clearly in their interests and what is also very important from an environmental point of view.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's final question in respect of disease control, we do not have responsibility in that area.  We do have responsibility in respect one dimension or aspect, that of food safety.  We do a lot of research around food safety from our Ashtown site, and we are also the national laboratory for the analysis of residues in meat.  We liaise with the Department regularly in regard to that area.  As far as the general economic diseases are concerned, we work very closely with Animal Health Ireland.  That is where we feature.  We also work closely with the Department in that area.  We have joint programmes under way and we subvent or provide a contribution to the work of Animal Health Ireland to enable it to recruit a technical officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538640000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Boyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#Y00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1538640000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I want to let Deputy Burke in because we will be caught for time in a few minutes.

Teagasc provides agricultural advice and the farmers are its clients.  I have read the report.  Health and safety is mentioned on page 51, and I know Dr. Jim Phelan has been active in this area, but I do not get a feel from the report that it is a significant priority for Teagasc.  What I mean by this is we know it is a priority but it is not an adequate priority.  On page 51, it states that in 2017 a total of 24 people died in accidents on Irish farms, which was an increase of three on the 2016 number.  To date this year, I believe there have been 16 or 17 farm deaths.  The very next sentence of the report states that Teagasc works with a number of partners to promote health and safety among rural stakeholders.  In the first paragraph on this issue Teagasc outsources much of the issue.  Even though everyone is concerned about this, I get the feeling no one has ownership when it comes to dealing with the problem.  It is a health and safety issue.  If there is a farm death, the Health and Safety Authority conducts the investigation, not Teagasc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#Z01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538640000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#Z02000","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1538640000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Even though Teagasc is the body that deals with farmers on an ongoing basis, it is the Health and Safety Authority that is responsible for health and safety and investigating farm accidents where there are deaths.  I heard a debate this week in the D&aacute;il from which I understand that many agencies are involved in health and safety.  Various Departments can have a stake in health and safety issues, and I am sure the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a role.  Teagasc has a role, as does the Health and Safety Authority.  I get the feeling that no one is taking full ownership of the issue.  I would have hoped it was Teagasc that did so.  I know that when something goes wrong, we have a statutory body to investigate it.<\/p> <p>  This point has been touched on a little and I ask Professor Boyle to give us a bit more information on the age profile of those involved in accidents.  All of us who live in rural Ireland have come across the situation of an old man out on his own trying to do what he used to do and do the work of three people.  He is not able to do it and should not be doing it.  We also have five year old children running around behind tractors.  All of these accidents are tragic.  Will Professor Boyle give us an age breakdown of all of the deaths?<\/p> <p>  Many younger people now work off the farms.  We are all talking about the situation this creates but we are not doing much about it.  A few years ago, I used to meet farmers who would tell me they had never been as well off as they were in the farm retirement scheme.  They had never had as much money in their working lives.  Many of those farms were vulnerable and not viable.  Now I meet farmers in their 70s who tell me they are working harder than they ever did because their sons are trying to hold down a day job.  We have 70 year old farmers out on their own with big machines and big tough animals.  I feel there is a growing risk.  It is a reflection of where we are in rural Ireland at present.  Will Professor Boyle also give us details on how many people involved in accidents were farming on their own at the time?  We have all heard of tragic accidents where a lot of time had elapsed before someone spotted there was a problem.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to spur on Teagasc to do more in this area.  This is where I am coming from.  I do not get it.  Teagasc has trained its staff through events it has run.  The staff it sends to farms have had training.  Professor Boyle has told us the Teagasc national safety conference took place in Clare last November.  How many farmers attend these events?  Teagasc's staff and consultants, the consultants who do reports for farmers and representatives from some farmers' organisations attend.  We feel bad when farm accidents happen and they are the biggest cause of workplace fatalities in Ireland.  This should not be the case.  Industry has been forced to take quite a step up and I do not think farmers have.  I ask Professor Boyle to reflect, come back and give us a bit more information.  No one is specifically responsible.  This is a plea from rural Ireland to help.  Professor Boyle knows all about this, but I would like a greater emphasis on it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Teagasc's financial statements, I always ask a basic question when I do not understand something.  If I do not understand something, I am quite sure I am not alone in that regard.  The Teagasc representatives understand what it means in the financial statements.  The financial statements contain the heading \"knowledge transfer\", which seems to be a very big source of income and expenditure.  It is a significant part of the accounts.  Teagasc's income also includes operations income, research income and Oireachtas grants, but knowledge transfer is a big part of it.  Will Professor Boyle explain to the people watching this, who are not familiar with Teagasc financial statements, what this is all about?  What does the heading mean?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018100400002#Z02100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538640000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The Chairman has raised an interesting point.

The committee has heard much evidence on the extent to which combating climate change is a significant national challenge.  Climate measures and policies chosen today will have consequences for Ireland for decades to come.  This represents an especially significant challenge for the transport sector in Ireland and elsewhere.  The sector must develop approaches to reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.  Ireland's rising population, our welcome return to economic growth, more people in employment and more goods being transported bring with them an increased number of vehicles on our roads and a rise in the number of kilometres driven.  Ireland's economy and society are busy and on the move, which presents the transport sector with various challenges.  Foremost among these is the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an expanding sector without impeding social progress or economic recovery.<\/p> <p>  Transport is not an end in itself.  It is a means to access jobs, markets, education, health services, cultural interaction and a range of other services and amenities that contribute to people leading healthy and fulfilling lives.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, inventories show a 6% growth in overall non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions in 2016.  Transport emissions grew by 4%.  The progress made in reducing transport emissions by 25% between 2007 and 2012 is being eroded by significant transport demand growth, which, unfortunately, is not yet all being met in the most efficient ways.  Transport emissions are only 6% below the key 2005 benchmark level.  Furthermore, EPA projections indicate that, without intervention, transport emissions could rise, not fall, between 2020 and 2035 as a result of a growing population, improving economy and increasing employment, along with a traditional settlement pattern that engenders and is now underpinned by private car use.<\/p> <p>  With responsibility for 20% of Irish emissions and as the third largest emitting sector, transport will have to play its part in the national decarbonisation undertaking, requiring a step-change in how we travel and do business and the types of fuels and technologies we employ.  These transport challenges are not unique to Ireland and are similarly faced by our EU and OECD partners.  The transport decarbonisation pathway must begin with sustained investment in public transport and active travel to improve the quality and capacity of our networks and, where feasible, encourage a shift away from private car use.  In parallel, we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and secure an early and sustainable transition to zero and low-emission vehicles.  Until these measures can produce meaningful results, Irish vehicle owners and users must have the most efficient vehicles and use them in the most carbon friendly ways.  This requires working with many actors on a series of complementary policy measures requiring a cross-governmental approach.<\/p> <p>  The national climate change mitigation plan, which the Government agreed in 2017, represents the critical first step in communicating the longer-term national climate vision.  Its role is to set out both the challenges to meeting Ireland's emissions-reduction targets and chart a clear and quantified path towards the long-term objective of transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy by 2050.  The plan sets out 24 transport mitigation measures and 29 associated actions.  These are wide-ranging and focus mainly on three themes, namely, modal shift, particularly to public transport in urban areas, the transition to alternatively fuelled vehicles and targeted behavioural change.  Of course, the mitigation measures outlined in a 2017 plan cannot provide a complete roadmap to achieve full decarbonisation by 2050.  Instead, they represent realistically where Ireland is now and how it can progress towards the ultimate goal of decarbonisation.  The plan is a living document and is continually updated as research, policy and innovation generate additional cost-effective mitigation options.<\/p> <p>  Over the period to 2050, the national mitigation plan will be supported by a series of complementary Government policies and strategies that will support its decarbonisation objectives.  Project Ireland 2040 is one such initiative and it will play a pivotal role in clearly establishing a national commitment to the right spatial planning and the capital investment needed to support projected population and employment growth in a sustainable manner.  Through Project Ireland 2040, the Government seeks to reconcile mobility needs with climate obligations by committing to integrating land use and spatial planning to encourage fewer and shorter journeys and to support public transport, walking and cycling as real alternatives to the private car.<\/p> <p>  On investment in public and sustainable transport, settlement patterns strongly influence how people travel.  The provision of sustainable transport options is only realistic when populations are located close to where people work, go to school, shop and socialise.  Continued investment in public and sustainable transport is a cornerstone of the Government's transport sector mitigation response.  Encouraging public transport use is central to national efforts to combat climate change, air pollution and other negative environmental and social impacts.  Public transport must provide a realistic and sustainable alternative, where feasible, to reduce the dominance of the private car.  The Government is committed to meeting increasing travel demand through more public transport capacity and by supporting cycling and walking.  This policy has seen some success.  In Dublin alone, more than two thirds of journeys to the city centre are now made on foot, by bicycle or by public transport, representing an increase of over 10% in the past six years.<\/p> <p>  In budget 2018, the process of investing wisely to increase capacity and enhance the range of alternatives to the car was stepped up.  Project Ireland 2040 will further build upon this investment under the \"Linking People and Places\" announcement of investment of &euro;8.6 billion specifically for public transport.  From Metrolink to BusConnects and the Luas expansion to cycle lanes, the groundwork is being laid for an integrated, diverse, transport future.  The aim is to link more people to more places while improving quality of life, easing congestion in our cities and doing our part in delivering a low-carbon society.  Investment in the planned BusConnects project could deliver an increase in services of up to 27% and journey time savings of up to 50%.  This would make capacity available and the switch to bus easier as will the availability if cleaner, lower-emitting buses.   Budget 2018 committed over &euro;100 million over four years to multi-annual cycling and walking programmes.  Further significant investment planned under BusConnects in Dublin, could deliver 200 km plus of cycle tracks and lanes and pedestrian facilities.<\/p> <p>  The decisive shift away from carbon-intensive transport will be further underpinned by the electrification of more of the rail network and a commitment to stop buying diesel-only urban buses.  By 2023, 500 buses should have been converted to low-emission vehicles.  While public transport accounts for less than 5% of Ireland's overall transport emissions, we recognise that leadership from our public transport sector in improving fuel efficiency and climate impact is important.  The national development plan commits that, from July 2019 onwards, Ireland will no longer buy diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet.  Work is under way to preparing for the implementation of this policy.  A green public transport fund has been established to support the take-up of low-carbon, energy efficient technologies within the public transport sector.  The fund is supporting the piloting and take-up of energy-efficient and alternative fuel technologies for PSO operators within the bus fleet and SPSV sector and will be used to bridge the price differential between such technologies and conventionally-fuelled vehicles.<\/p><p>We will begin an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials later this year to help further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years.  We will test, on Dublin and Cork bus routes, a range of technologies including full electric, diesel-electric hybrids and compressed natural gas.  The trials will consider CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions, air quality impacts, and contribution potential towards renewable energy targets, as well as fuelling and infrastructure costs. <br\/><br\/>To mention the transition to alternative fuels, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and securing an early transition to zero and low-emission vehicles is integral to our transport mitigation efforts and offers one of the most cost-effective and feasible pathways to meeting our carbon mitigation and air pollution objectives.  This is particularly important outside urban areas where dependence on private cars is strongest and where public transport systems and active travel offer less potential for effectively addressing travel needs.<br\/><br\/>Fossil fuel use has become deeply embedded into our driving culture and we are almost entirely dependent on imported oil.  Of the total vehicle fleet, over 45% of vehicles use petrol while nearly 54% operate on diesel, meaning less than 1% of vehicles are alternatively fuelled at present.  Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and switching to greener alternatives will be essential if we are to successfully decarbonise the sector but the profile of our current fleet reflects the scale of change required.  <br\/><br\/>Project Ireland 2040 earmarks investments to support the transition to zero emission capable cars, underpinning a target of half a million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030.  The groundwork for this ambitious target was laid in Ireland&rsquo;s national policy framework<i><\/i>on alternative fuels infrastructure for transport<i><\/i>published in 2017.  It represented an important step in communicating the longer-term national vision for decarbonising transport by 2050 and set out our ambition that, by 2030, all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emissions capable.<br\/><br\/>Colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment are working to ensure that access to refuelling or recharging infrastructure does not act as a barrier to the take-up of alternatively fuelled vehicles.  The framework sets minimum levels of provision of refuelling infrastructure and common technical standards to permit interoperability.  All this provides a supportive, enabling environment for suppliers and consumers and increased confidence and reassurance in our national commitment to the emerging alternative fuel-technology market. <br\/><br\/>The task force on low emitting vehicles, established on foot of A Programme for Partnership Government commitment, is considering in a thorough, pragmatic and targeted manner the range of measures and options available to the Government to accelerate the deployment of low-carbon technologies, especially electric vehicles.  The task force is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and its membership includes the key relevant Departments and bodies. <br\/><br\/>Its work was divided into two phases with the first phase focusing on electric vehicles and its second phase now focusing on other alternative fuels.  We consider that the task force is working effectively to assemble and consider the many factors influencing the scale and rate of transition to low emitting vehicles. <br\/><br\/>An attractive array of incentives has been put in place to encourage motorists to make the switch to electric and this is supported by an extensive recharging network in which we are again investing in upgrading and expanding.  The pace of take-up is accelerating rapidly with more electric vehicles sold in the first four months of 2018 than in all of 2017.  July and August saw the highest monthly sales of electric vehicles ever recorded in Ireland.  The emissions reduction dividends from the switch to electric vehicles will take time to accrue but the pathway is now being clearly established. <br\/><br\/>This is the most climate significant transformation in transport, replacing conventionally fossil-fuelled vehicles on the roads.  The initial investment required in alternative technologies and supporting infrastructure is admittedly costly but can help Ireland to adapt more quickly to this inevitable transition away from conventional fuels.  Encouraging alternative fuels and technologies also actively sets Ireland on the right longer-term path towards full decarbonisation and cleaner air.  Furthermore, these challenges also provide us with many opportunities for additional benefits to our overall health and living standards.  New technologies and new fuels offer great potential and reasons to be optimistic. <br\/><br\/>On making the existing fleet less emitting, we are not ignoring the sizeable existing vehicle fleet and the key role played by efficiencies, eco-driving and increased biofuel use in delivering sustained transport emissions reductions.  We continue to work hard at EU level, pushing strongly for better EU vehicle efficiency standards for cars, vans and heavy duty vehicles.  This regulatory approach has yielded important efficiencies in the cars and vans sector already.  Setting the next phase of targets for cars and vans and setting new targets for heavy duty vehicles will be a key component of Irish success in reducing vehicle emissions in the short to medium term, as our status as technology takers remains unchanged.  <br\/><br\/>Biofuels have also played a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport.  The biofuels obligation scheme, BOS, comes under the aegis of our colleague Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  First introduced in 2010, the scheme requires suppliers of road transport fuel to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their national annual fuel sales.  The level of obligation has been increased a number of times since its introduction and it is the declared intention to continue to increase it further on a phased basis to 2020.  This will not only yield significant transport emissions dividends but also will bring us very close to the 2020 target for renewable energy in transport. <br\/><br\/>In terms of climate adaptation, as well as the measures to reduce transport emissions in line with EU and international obligations, there is also the challenge of building climate resilience within the transport sector.  Even if greenhouse gas emissions were to completely stop from today, global climate change would continue for many decades as a result of past emissions. <br\/><br\/>This poses two challenges, namely, the task of ensuring continued services and maintaining infrastructure for roads, rail, aviation, ports and buses, and the need to protect new assets by ensuring that today&rsquo;s design specifications will adequately address tomorrow&rsquo;s infrastructure needs.  The first transport sectoral climate change adaptation plan, Developing Resilience to Climate Change in the Irish Transport Sector, was published in December 2016.  The plan outlines climate research and analysis to guide our journey in future-proofing our vital road, rail, aviation, ports and bus services and infrastructure.  Building on this knowledge base, work has started on our statutory adaptation plan for transport.  The next step, in conjunction with other key infrastructure sectors, is the identification of critical national transport infrastructure.  Important work has been under way across the sector, including detailed risk assessments of critical road and rail infrastructure developed by key transport stakeholders.  In particular, I note Transport Infrastructure Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change on Ireland&rsquo;s Light Rail and National Road Network, as well as Irish Rail&rsquo;s ongoing work developing the coastal railway vulnerability index.  The Department continues to support our front-line actors - transport agencies and local authorities &ndash; to identify potential vulnerabilities within their operations and to consider how these can be addressed. <br\/><br\/>Adaptive capacity to climate change is also being considered as part of ongoing work on the Planning Land Use and Transport &ndash; Outlook 2040,<i><\/i>PLUTO, assessment, which is updating the existing framework for transport investment published in 2015.  Its work is considering how best adaptation requirements and measures should be reflected in the estimation of steady-state maintenance costs. <br\/><br\/>The committee has heard much evidence on the extent to which combatting climate change is that significant national challenge I mentioned at the outset.  It is clear that climate measures and policies implemented today will have consequences for Ireland for decades to come.  EPA projections for our 2030 prospects are sobering.  Strong levels of investment for new emissions-efficient public transport capacity have been secured; investment in cycling and walking is being ramped up; efficiency standards in vehicles are improving every year; the range of incentives to encourage the transition to electric vehicles has been convincingly developed and the proportion of biofuels in petrol and diesel is increasing. <br\/><br\/>All these efforts are currently being cancelled out, however, by rising demand.  Each transport trip now is less emitting than it was before.  Nonetheless emissions are rising.  Every year demand for trips to work, education, shopping, leisure and social interaction rise as population and employment grows and goods transport in support of exports, increased construction activity and higher agricultural output grows.  The development of policy responses for transport needs to continue and go even further. <br\/><br\/>Decarbonising transport by 2050 will require a transformation, expected mainly to be achieved through the promotion, deployment and uptake of new technologies and alternative fuels.  Alongside technology development, more and better lower carbon public transport, more use of active travel modes, a reduction in the need to travel and shorter journey distances must also play a role.  Every sector needs to identify new measures and intensify those already yielding results and that analysis needs to start right away.  The focus must be on early, co-ordinated action.  Ireland&rsquo;s response must involve a whole-of-Government approach, be comprehensive and be quickly identified. <br\/><br\/>Collectively, these actions will move us towards achieving the long-term vision of a low-carbon society.  It will not be easy and it will require a fundamental societal transformation but with the substantial investment identified, and through the focus given by Project Ireland 2040, we can expect to see changes in the transport sector as it steps up its efforts to reduce its climate impact. <br\/><br\/>Achieving the necessary transport emissions mitigation will require individual consciousness and action by us all.<\/p><p>It also requires continuing close co-operation between my Department and other key Departments across the areas of transport, taxation, fuel policy, investment policy, air quality and spatial planning.  My Department will continue to work closely with all the various actors and their various policy drivers as we seek to secure significant and sustainable national emission savings, and ultimately a largely decarbonised economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1538658000,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle and welcome the witnesses from the Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA.  More than 20% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transport and the 4% growth in 2016 alone is alarming.  We need to see a step change in this regard.  We are not within an ass's roar of meeting our targets for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for 2020.  I highlighted in the D&aacute;il Chamber six or seven years ago that we would hit this carbon cliff and now it is in front of us.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Doyle outlined the changes that are being made regarding electric vehicles.  If one looks at the graphs that have been presented today, however, one will see there were 900 new purchases in 2017, and there were approximately 2,600 such vehicles in the State.  That shows it is moving at a snail's pace.  What is being done at Government level in the Department and across other Departments to accelerate that?  There has been an increase in grants and incentives but the real issue is range anxiety.  Does Mr. Doyle agree?  What is being done to address that?  We are way behind Norway and Holland, which is much smaller than Ireland but has 20 times more charging points than Ireland.  In Norway some 20% of all new vehicles sold are electric vehicles, EVs.  What is being done about those issues?<\/p> <p>  The issue of charging points is continually being side-stepped.  The ESB erected and installed them, and it is runs the scheme for free, on which I commend it.  The regulator has stated that cannot continue, however.  Why not?  What is the Department doing to address that issue, which is one of the key issues for getting more EVs onto the road?<\/p> <p>  On biogas, Mr. Doyle should outline the steps that will be taken now to address that huge 19% gap.  We will hit a 1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  What is being done to address the gap of almost 20%, which is the minimum we should meet?  As the paper outlines, the way things are going our greenhouse gas emissions may actually increase for transport.  Not only do we not want it to increase but we also have a big gap to fill and we must try to catch up.  <\/p> <p>  What is being done to address the issue of alternative sources of fuel for heavy vehicles?  In particular, Mr. Doyle might address one claim the Irish Road Haulage Association is making.  I am not a scientist or engineer but it claims there is a new European hi-tech engine, which is up to the Euro 6 emissions standard.  I understand that almost all the carbon emissions that would come out of the exhaust pipes of those trucks are captured because of the new technology which is installed in them.  I do not know if the Department is aware of that but obviously it would be good if it can be done and we need to hear about it.  Has an assessment done of that at Government level been done?<\/p> <p>  On the indigenous sources of biogas, what measures are being taken?  We have a huge amount of agricultural waste.  One plant is generating biogas, some of which could be used for compressed natural gas, CNG.  What progress has been made and, more importantly, what steps will be taken to increase the use of CNG?  I brought forward a paper on this last year to highlight CNG's importance and its potential both for the agricultural sector and for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  <\/p> <p>  Biofuels will require much land.  A perfect storm seems to be coming here, in that we are increasing food production with Food Harvest 2020, increased output and so on but the use of land is almost maxed out and we have seen a fodder crisis.  What is happening in respect of the land to grow this biofuel?  There is much marginal land around where the three peat-fuelled power stations are located.  Are the ESB, the Department and Bord na M&oacute;na in discussions and have they worked out a plan for the use of this land?  Much of it is underused.  There was a scheme for willow but it was not successful.  That is fair enough, but what has been done in the meantime?  Is everyone sitting on his or her hands and hoping it will go away or that it can be dealt with tomorrow?  This issue should have been dealt with six or seven years ago at a minimum.  What is being done about looking at that fairly marginal land in places such as north-west Offaly, Longford, other midland counties and further afield, where we could produce biomass rather than importing it from the United States?  It is good news that the Bord na M&oacute;na project to do that is buried.  It was nuts.  The carbon footprint of hauling that biomass across the Atlantic would far exceed anything that oil or coal, the dirtiest of all fuels, would create.<\/p> <p>  On public transport, there is a question of integration, which catches the public's attention.  What are we doing about having a system, as exists in other European countries, where one can book into a hotel and be given a ticket which takes one around the city for the next week?  Why can we not have something like that here, or at least have one ticket that brings the ticket holder everywhere on all transport?  I have heard these questions asked as far back as ten and 15 years ago.  People will talk about Leap cards and so on but we still seem unable to get full integration, which a commuter coming in from the country in the morning, perhaps travelling 40 or 50 miles on a train, wants to be able to get.  We need to make the system much simpler.<\/p> <p>  To have effective public transport hubs and fully integrated transport, we need more parking facilities.  If people are travelling to the capital, to Galway or to wherever they want to go, and we want them to do the last 40 miles by train, what are we doing about putting parking in place?  Portarlington, Portlaoise, Ballybrophy all have chronic parking problems.  It is impossible to get parking anywhere near Portlaoise station in the morning.  There are huge difficulties there, along with an extra cost.  The commuter is charged &euro;100 a week for the train ticket and then there is another charge every day to park the car.  It is penal and we will not get people onto public transport if that is how we go about it.  People will continue to use private cars and choke up the N7, N4, M1 and so on.  I ask Mr. Doyle to address that.<\/p> <p>  I have written to the NTA about bus shelters, and it responded a couple of years ago.  We need them.  If one goes north of the Border, one will see they do not need to be elaborate or worth &euro;30,000.  They can be simple, basic shelters in rural areas.  If people have to stand at a bus stop in Borris-in-Ossory, Castletown, Mountrath, Ballybrittas, Newtown or Ballylinan in Laois and wait for a bus to come on a wet morning, as trucks pass and spray them with rain and everything else, they will not do it.  We must provide corridors where people can go to a local bus stop and stand there with a level of comfort and protection from rain.<\/p><p>Take the type of heavy showers that occur now.  We can get a week's rain in five minutes.  That is the way of things at present.  People standing at bus stops are soaked through before they even get to work.  Getting bus stops in place seems to be a big deal.  I suggest that the Department let the local councils do it.  Give them the money and let them get on with it.  That is what happens in every other civilised country.  The councils need to provide the bus shelters on the N7, N77, N78 and other routes throughout the State.  Allow the local authorities to do that and trust them.  Their membership comprises capable people who were elected by the public.  There are also trained officials and, between them, they will work out with the local engineers where these bus stops should go.  They do not need to be massive, just big enough to hold four or five people in rural areas and maybe somebody with a buggy or a walking frame.  We should try to accommodate people with proper bus corridors in rural areas.  They should have some level of comfort and be able to get on to a bus without being soaked through going to work or wherever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#E00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanley.

The year 2035 seems to be the point where the really fundamental and exciting change will happen.  In the meantime, we have got to do everything possible to work with the uptake of the technology that is there and encourage it.  There are a huge range of measures to assist with that.  Range anxiety continues to be an issue but we are seeing improvements all of the time in the technology that is there.  We are going to see some significant additional improvements in the next number of years.  To date, many of the electric vehicles have been in the small car range and not suitable for the executive or somebody who has to work with long distances.  There is no question that one of the biggest challenges in the transport space in Ireland in providing public transport in the context of climate change is our dispersed population.

It was established by the Government between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because it was recognised that EVs are significant for us on the transport side in delivering the decarbonisation of transport.  Many of the policy levers on EVs do not, however, reside with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The LEV task force was an attempt to bring all of the Government Departments with responsibilities in the area of regulation, infrastructure, pricing incentives, etc., around the same table.  It is intended to tackle, in a concerted way, the wrinkles and difficulties that might exist around the system on the deployment of EVs.  On the work the LEV task force has done, the first phase has focused on EVs.  The Deputies are probably aware that an interim report was made by the LEV task force to the Government in advance of the budget last year and that a range of new incentives for the roll-out of EVs was announced then.<\/p> <p>  Some of them have been introduced by our Department, including the tolling incentive and the grant for taxis and hackneys.  The benefit-in-kind incentive was introduced by the Minister for Finance and further supports have been put in place by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment for infrastructure, including home-charging grants.  We have seen the results of that concerted action this year with the increased take-up of EVs.  That was from a very low base and it had been very disappointing.  We had a generous range of incentives in place to facilitate the take-up of EVs before we even set up the LEV task force.  That did not seem to be enough to trigger a mass take-up because of people's concerns about the vehicles themselves and, most likely, range anxiety.<\/p><p>However, following the putting in place of a targeted range of incentives, we have seen a very significant response.  In the first four months of this year, we saw more EVs bought in Ireland than in all of 2017.  July and August have been record months for the purchase of EVs.  We have 6,500 EVs on the road now.  That does not sound like a lot but from where we were two or three years ago, it is a significant increase.  That pattern is continuing.

The Irish Road Haulage Association is correct that the Euro 6 standard for HGVs is an extraordinarily high standard with regard to air pollutants.  It has certainly put in place a lot of technology to trap the most harmful particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, NOx - the nasty air quality pollutants that come from diesel vehicles generally.  In that respect, the standards are a very significant development.  They have been in place for a few years.  However, what is probably most significant in terms of reducing carbon emissions from the HGV sector is the negotiations that are currently ongoing at EU level for the putting in place of a new set of regulations around CO2 in heavy-duty vehicles where the EU is seeking at the manufacturing stage for the first time to put in place a standard, which will require full information to be made available to all purchasers as to the carbon outcome of the truck, that is, however many grammes of carbon per kilometre the truck will emit.  That monitoring is beginning next year.  From then, the EU hopes to be able to secure a reduction every year with the setting of specific targets, for 2025 and 2030, that manufacturers will be required to produce vehicles that are less emitting.  That is by far the most cost-effective way of ensuring that the road freight fleet starts on its decarbonisation journey.<\/p> <p>  The technologies in the HGV sector are not progressing at the same pace as they have been in the cars and vans sector - the lighter duty vehicles.  The deployment of battery technology, in particular, is not suitable for the most part yet for HGVs although there are some promising pilots.  Hydrogen is slow to develop also in that space.<\/p> <p>  For us, the Deputy is absolutely correct.  One of the key alternative fuels that we need to start deploying within our freight fleet in the absence of those technologies happening is compressed natural gas, CNG, and using that then as a pathway to the introduction of biogas in the system.  The European Union is supporting Gas Networks Ireland in deploying a range of refuelling infrastructure.  We expect to have 14 CNG publicly-available refuelling stations open by 2020.  Gas Networks Ireland is working with private fleets to allow for refuellers.<\/p> <p>  Phase 1 of the low emissions vehicle, LEV, task force looked at EVs but phase 2 is turning its attention to the gases - CNG, biogas and hydrogen - in terms of how we might work with our colleagues in the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure that the system examines fully what incentives might be needed, but also what impediments might be in place within the system, to allow us to move forward in the gaseous fuels space, as we have managed successfully to do in terms of EVs.

The constraint was funding.  We will be happy with the additional funding that we believe will come forward to increase our provision of bus shelters.

When one buys a ticket for the train, one should be given a small disk which one would put on the car.  There are ways around the difficulty.  Commuters who are heavily taxed paying &euro;100 plus a week to get into whatever city by means of a 40-mile or 50-mile journey feel this is a significant additional imposition.<\/p> <p>  I have one point on the bus shelters.  The problem is the process is too slow.  I am aware that the National Transport Authority has supported some of them and has managed to get some in place, but the process is too slow.  They are big and expensive.  Something more basic will do.  There are simpler models in other countries.  North of the Border, there are simpler ones that can be erected.  I am not saying the NTA should put up something shabby looking but small bus shelters can be put up.  One can have a design for them for certain types of towns and villages, and very small ones for rural areas for perhaps four passengers to stand into etc.  Where there is a bigger catchment, such as in Mountrath, one could have slightly bigger ones.  That is all I would say in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#G00600","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":666,"content":"<p>On the issue of parking at train stations, would it be possible to look at that idea of an integrated ticket whereby one buys a train ticket that includes parking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":667,"content":"<p>We can have a look at that.

With regard to electric vehicles, it was mentioned that 6,500 are being used as a result of concerted action.  I respectfully disagree.  We are really going at a snail's pace compared with some other countries.  What are the Department's ideas for accelerating progress?  In Norway, for example, half of all cars sold last year were electric and over half this year will be electric.  We are way behind what other countries are doing in this area.  Mr. Doyle stated that the real action will happen around 2035, which demonstrates a lack of ambition in trying to accelerate progress.  We need much greater ambition and to try to match leading countries in Europe and elsewhere on this.  Why should we not replicate what Norway has done, for example?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy touched on how this can be communicated.  It will happen through certain incentives.  Norway piloted a tolling model, with reduced or free tolling for electric vehicles.  Could we do something in this regard for a short period to try to drive change?  I know there are contracts but we must really accelerate policy actions.  I know the Department is trying to drive policy in the area but it is much too slow.  We need more ideas and perhaps the witnesses can enlighten us on what other European countries are doing.  We have the example of Norway.  What can we do with the tax base to really promote electric vehicles?  As has been mentioned, 20% of greenhouse gas emissions are transport-related and half of that comes from private cars.  If we could replicate what Norway - an oil-producing country - can do in the area of electric vehicles, we could massively reduce our carbon footprint very quickly.  We need innovative solutions in respect of tax in order that people can engage in a behavioural change.  Our actions thus far do not match those of other countries.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is the replacement of our bus and rail fleet.  Will the witnesses indicate when existing stock will be replaced in order to reduce our carbon footprint?  What capital replacement model is in place and how will it affect carbon emissions?  There was mention of park-and-ride facilities and trying to encourage commuters to use trains.  A new charging system has been implemented at Dunboyne station, for example, and where there used to be many cars parked, there are now none as a result of the prohibitive model being used.  This completely contradicts the climate change approach.  As Deputy Stanley mentioned, there must be a different model.  This may include, for example, integrated ticketing and parking facilities.  The current charging system for parking is reducing the number of people who use commuter trains.  In addition, planning applications such as the example of the new Broombridge Luas station, which is integrated with the trains, were progressed without any parking facilities.  There will be electrification of the line through that station.  There is to be another new train station at Pelletstown, with very little provision for parking and, therefore, a massively negative impact on people who live around those areas.  We are talking about park-and-ride facilities but the desired impact on the ground in suburban Dublin does not follow.  The charging model does not help potential or existing commuters or people who want to live in residential areas where train stations are being developed.  I would like to hear more about actual park-and-ride facilities and what is being done in that regard.  Currently, tenders are being awarded to private clampers who are punishing people who want to commute.  We need a much more positive model of park-and-ride facilities to help commuters.<\/p> <p>  There have been good changes involving integrated ticketing.  The Netherlands, for example, has a cashless model involving e-cards and many public services should transition to that.  What is being done to bring about a cashless payment system?  BusConnects is dotted throughout this and it is important that the Department and the NTA are cognisant of the democratic decision of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann regarding BusConnects and the rejection of the current proposal, with a request for the reversal of many changes to routes.  There has been much spin, including the claim of a 27% increase in services.  In suburban areas in north and south Dublin, people will see the opposite happening, with many services being very much adversely affected.  These changes are being rejected by people living in those areas.  What were the terms of reference in respect of BusConnects?  What was the advertising spend on BusConnects specifically?  There seems to be a very direct and aggressive campaign to fool people in suburban Dublin about what the people involved want the population to believe.  They can read the maps in order to see the real impact.

I have made clear we are very anxious to do all we can in the intervening period to reach the objective faster.  I want to be clear about that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned tolling in Norway.  We already have such a scheme in place already.  He also made a good point about what could be done to incentivise the use of electric vehicles using the tax base in terms, if we go back to the way motor taxation was calculated some time ago, it resulted in a significant behavioural shift.  These days, we have large numbers of diesel cars and a different problem from CO2  in terms of air quality.  We can see the power of the diesel incentive so the Deputy's point is well made.

We do not in any way pretend that 6,500 electric vehicles on the road is something to celebrate with alacrity.  However, this year demand for electric vehicles in the Irish market shot up in response to the incentives that were put in place in the budget last year.  The constraint on the purchasing of electric vehicles this year has been the lack of availability of stock.  Car dealers cannot get the stock in quickly enough to meet demand for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids this year.  This is a response to a significant step-up in demand, which we find encouraging.  Part of the reason the stock is not available to us has been the success of electric vehicles in Norway, which is taking up a sizeable amount of electric vehicle output in the European Union.  We wish we could emulate the range of incentives that have been put in place in Norway but the cost of those is running at more than &euro;1 billion already.  Despite the range of incredibly generous incentives that have been put in place at a very sizeable cost, only 50% of new vehicles being purchased in Norway are electric vehicles.  To put in context the kinds of incentives we would have to put in place to achieve what Norway has achieved on electric vehicles, Mr. Doyle mentioned that we introduced a tolling incentive on 1 July 2018.  This provides for a 50% reduction at almost every toll in the country for a full battery electric vehicle and a 25% reduction for plug-in hybrids.  A driver with an electric vehicle toll tag will pay half tolls.  We are delighted with that measure and we hope it is contributing in some part to the increase in demand for electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers also referred to cashless transport in the context of electric vehicles.  It is worthwhile pointing out that all the electricity to fuel electric vehicles from the public recharging network is currently free.  As such, it is totally cashless already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1538658000,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  Having listened to the presentations, it is very clear the difficulties the National Transport Authority has, as an independent body, in trying to co-ordinate the issues.  I have considerable understanding of what Ms Behan has to do to try to pull all sides together to get a coherent policy framework in place.  I have raised the same issues with officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment who are not in charge of all the policy elements.  There is no doubt that individual Departments will have their own concerns, issues and responsibilities.  What I would like to hear from Mr. Doyle is what delineation can be made and what movement can be made in terms of responsibility around certain areas.  It seems somewhat bizarre that because the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has responsibility for the generation of electricity, the network or charging points should necessarily reside in that Department.  If that was a function of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Doyle could possibly deploy some policies that would ensure the charging network was built out more quickly to other areas.<\/p> <p>  I concur with Deputy Stanley because a number of constituents who have made the shift to electric vehicles have informed me their next vehicle purchase will be a hybrid.  They are moving backwards because fast charging points are not available and they are not being policed or managed to the extent that they should be, which means other people park in them.  Moreover, they have also been broken on occasion.  When I question the ESB and others, their response is that the charging network is adequate for the number of electric vehicles we have and the number anticipated.  If we are trying to overcome the range anxiety issue, we have to front-load charging facilities to the extent that people become sick of seeing them around the place and they become ubiquitous.  This will result in a consciousness among the public that they will not be caught out without access to a power source.<\/p> <p>  We met representatives of the automotive sector.  They are introducing new electric vehicles with improved range and the car class issue is also being addressed.  At some point, we will reach a tipping point, where there will be a significant demand and I am concerned that the network of charging points will not adequate to meet it.  The incentives are good, but could be better.  Others have outlined what has happened in Norway and we have put forward policy proposals in that regard in the past.<\/p> <p>  It is imperative that we do something big to give confidence to consumers that we will ensure they have access to a charging network.  Charging it home will not be an issue.  The concern is that people will be caught out somewhere else.<\/p><p>There is an issue around train stations and Luas stations.  There should be much better parking options at the Red Cow for those of us who travel from the country to the city.  One can spend an hour pumping diesel fumes in traffic for the five or six miles from the N7 to the city.  If parking was available at the Red Cow, it would make a significant contribution towards decluttering the city.  I take the point that different places are owned by different entities.  Mr. Doyle should tell us what kind of places his Department would like control of.  We can act together to reorientate that approach. <\/p><p> There are issues around the charging and parking policies of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  A sign in the carpark of Limerick railway station warns drivers that they are responsible for their vehicle at night.  It is really saying that people would be better off not parking in the station carpark overnight because there are certain blind spots and there have been break-ins.  I can understand that from the point of view of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The board and CEO of the company have many issues to address, and parking falls well down the line in terms of its contribution to climate change.  One of the Departments must take responsibility, and I do not just mean responsibility for co-ordination.  <\/p><p> Mr. Doyle said that diesel-only purchases will end in 2019.  I have made the point at other committees about the decision to purchase 110 buses last year.  That has been done and we cannot go back on it.  There is no point in hauling Mr. Doyle over the coals about it, but we should agree that, from today onwards, the bus companies should use what they have until an alternative can be sourced.  They should not purchase anything beyond today.  This is not just about the electricity network.  We should also consider compressed natural gas.  It will be a long time before the industry invests in that.  <\/p><p> There has been talk about hydrogen in certain areas, particularly its potential use for heavy goods vehicles.  It would be expensive to roll out technology like that, but we should decide to do that in any case.  Perhaps it would not be used for ten or 15 years, and perhaps technology would improve and that approach will be made redundant.  If it helps in the move towards less polluting approaches to transport, we should do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#K00600","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":710,"content":"<p>On Deputy Dooley's question on buses, can the witness give us a price differential between the cost of a diesel bus and a non-diesel, lower emission bus?

In order to attract the early adopters perhaps it is worth overinvesting in some of the infrastructure.  I am not suggesting that money should be spent recklessly.  Safeguards are put in to protect people, and the greater the number of people who adopt electric vehicle technology, the more popular this mode of transport will become.  People will understand that one charge, done at home, will be more than adequate for most of their activity.  There are some who will need more charge, however.  Tesla has rolled out some technology on the M8 and M7, and I am sure it has done the same on other roads.  I am sure the NTA has been involved in that very welcome development.

What I mean by that are locations on key rail, light rail and bus corridors.  It is generally proposed to locate them around the M50, the kind of area where one encourages people to interchange to public transport in order to get into Dublin city.  The situation in our regional cities is similar.  We would take responsibility for the design and implementation of those.  In some cases, it is about improving existing infrastructure like the Red Cow roundabout and some of the key rail stations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of bus purchases, Dublin Bus is purchasing nine test vehicles.  It is in the process of purchasing that low-fleet emission fleet from three manufacturers and will run testing early next year.  That will help us develop our procurement strategy for low-emission double-decker buses.  We will start that procurement next year.  As Mr. Doyle said, a deliberate decision was taken to purchase as many Euro 6 vehicles as possible because that provides other benefits for the city centre, particularly lower levels of noxious substances and much lower levels of particulates.  We want to see those improvements as well and to have as young a fleet as possible operating in our city centres.  We need to move forward to address carbon emissions.  Dublin Bus will be starting the trial, which will inform our procurement strategy, next year.<\/p> <p>  We are also looking at where we can pilot the use of electric buses.  In association with Bus &Eacute;ireann, we are looking at a small electric pilot scheme in one of the regional towns.  The exact location for the project has not yet been identified.

I will ramble around a few issues, some of which have been mentioned.  I have a number of questions as well.<\/p> <p>  Missing from Mr. Doyle's statement were phrases such as \"the Minister is determined\", \"the Minister wants\", \"the Minister is anxious\" and \"the Minister is ambitious for\".  There is no mention of the Minister, which might be par for the course as regards contributions.  The point I am emphasising relates to the lack of political drive behind some of the things we are doing or need to do, the lack of overall urgency regarding the situation and the need, as mentioned by previous speakers, for a communications strategy.<\/p> <p>  I made a pretty detailed submission regarding BusConnects so I will not go into that matter now.  One of the key questions that came up, which I mentioned in my submission and at public information meetings I held concerns the nature of the NTA.  It is a pretty significant matter that needs to be addressed because the public does not know what the NTA is.  We can operate in a bubble when it comes to matters such as climate change and assume that many things are happening while the public might be going off in a different direction.  Electric vehicles are an example in this regard.  We are all talking about electric vehicles but there is very little talk about hybrids.  The witnesses have no figures on hybrids.  Perhaps they have them and can circulate them to us.  The public has made the decision that hybrid or a mixture of hybrid is the way it is going until range anxiety and other issues are resolved.  So in a few years' time, we will end up with a situation where people will have hybrids or a mix of hybrid vehicles that they purchased in good faith.  The position for them will be similar to those who purchased diesel cars in good faith until the science changed and who are now stuck with them.  Something might happen in the budget.  There is a need for a sustained national communications strategy.  That would be one of the things for which I would be pushing.  This needs to start and be continuously featured in people's lives.  They know that climate change is here and there is a real appetite for discovering what they can do.<\/p> <p>  The public's experience of trying to do things by themselves regarding climate change has been mixed.  I remember the first kerbside collections in Dublin, namely, the small green boxes the size of milk crates.  They were not that big.  We discovered after six or seven years of operation that almost all of the material the public had gone to the trouble of segregating ended up in landfill.  It was a real case of brushing something under the carpet.  The material had not gone to recycling plants at all.  There are serious questions to be asked about that.  How much of the material people recycle actually ends up being recycled?  How much of it ends up in landfill?  How much of the organic material we put out in brown bins in Dublin ends up in landfill because people do these things in good faith?  When the science said something in 2008, people made a shift to vehicles with diesel engines in good faith.  We continue to publish figures such as those in the pictorial graph relating to emissions.  I am making the assumption that this is based on us accepting the figures motor manufacturers are giving us but it has been proven that they have been lying through their teeth.  On the figures we are discussing in the context of reduced emissions, it was mentioned that 95.6% of vehicles are in AB emission bands.  Is that according to vehicle handbooks or is it a scientifically proven fact?  If it is based on what the manufacturers are telling us, we cannot trust it at all.  These are small things.  There is a need for a national communications strategy.<\/p> <p>  This committee must, in the context of the report it eventually compiles, must produce solid, concrete and tangible actions that the public can implement in their homes.  We have heard some fascinating information.<\/p><p>I have not attended all the meetings but I have read the Official Report of proceedings and watched recordings of the committee's discussions on issues such as housing and insulation and on what is being done in other countries.  They are the kind of things at which we need to look.  The communications issue is the first one.  It must be communicated that this needs to be done and that there is an urgency to it and to outline the things people can do in their personal lives.<\/p><p> The second issue relates to the political ambition behind all of this.  The Department and the NTA can only do what they are directed to do.  I have not heard of any great urgency propelling them forward in the work they do.<\/p><p> I will go through some of the issues raised, including the electric vehicles and the ESB.  We should not ultimately leave it exclusively to the ESB.  Perhaps in terms of public infrastructure it is important.  In the United States, the much-maligned Tesla did a deal with Burger King or Dunkin' Donuts so that charging points are located at a number of their outlets.  I think Dundrum town centre has a number of charging points.  I what was said about the hope that people might charge their vehicles at home.  Let us look at it in terms of the countries that are leading on this.  What has their experience been?  Do people predominantly charge at home?  If that is the case then it is good to follow that.  It would be useful to have charging points at hospitals, workplaces, shopping centres and tax offices so people do not have to sit in their cars waiting for them to charge but can actively do something.<\/p><p> The witnesses mentioned that transport accounts for 20% of our emissions.  Aviation accounts for 20% of that total and the figure for aviation emissions is increasing.  It looks as if the other transport sectors may contract over time, if we are lucky and if we achieve all the targets and introduce electric cars, buses, public transport and, particularly, the infrastructure relating to BusConnects, of which I am a supporter.  It should come first.  This relates to what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy said about the third runway at Dublin Airport.  It looks like aviation, in the Irish context, is just going to grow and grow and there does not seem to be any alternative to aviation fuels.  Aviation has not been mentioned specifically but it looks as if it will be a growing factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#M01100","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>Who would like to contribute first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I will address a number of those points and Ms Behan will deal with the question on the electric vehicle charging points.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the Minister not being mentioned in my statement, the committee made a point of inviting a series of Secretaries General to come before it over a number of weeks.

The Deputy asked about the ratio between battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.  In Ireland, we have an unusual profile in that regard.  Most of our European counterparts have seen more plug-in hybrid vehicles sold than full-battery electric vehicles.  In Ireland ,our ratio was previously 3:1.  This year, for the first time, it has moved to 2:1.  As Deputy Dooley stated, there has been some slippage to the plug-in hybrid space as opposed to the full-battery electric vehicle.  In Ireland, the range is increasing significantly for full-battery electric vehicles.  Journey distances in Ireland will be conducive to the range that will be available in battery electric vehicles.  It is currently available in some and the range coming on stream over the next year or two will mean that we, unlike our European counterparts, we will probably have a very strong take-up of full-battery electric vehicles here.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the emissions testing regimes that have been put in place in order to give vehicles their certification around climate emissions.  When a vehicle is sold it is sold with a particular certificate indicating its climate performance based on a test.  There were certainly some very well publicised cases on the accuracy or otherwise of those tests.  Those particular cases related to the manipulation of air quality emissions in the testing as opposed to climate emissions.  It is undoubtedly the case, however, that in a laboratory setting, where these types of tests are undertaken, the conditions that are deployed in the tests are not the same as real-world driving emissions.  We assume there is a certain differential between the certificate base of efficiency or carbon output per kilometre in laboratory testing and real world testing.  Across Europe, we have been attempting to deal with that through the introduction of a new testing regime which is a much longer test cycle over a variety of different modes which try to replicate urban driving or long distance driving over a much longer period.  The outcomes from that new series of tests will start to be seen on vehicle certificates from next year.  They will be introduced from 1 January 2019 and will be fully implemented by 1 January 2020 so all new cars coming on stream over the next couple of years will have their emissions testing outcomes based on a much more rigorous testing model.  We expect to see some differences arising from it but we will have a much more accurate representation of the carbon emissions per kilometre.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the private charging points, which we call destination charging, it is undoubtedly the case that there are a large number of them already.  A large number of businesses, shopping centres, hotels and supermarkets make charge points available to their customers in the same way as they make Wi-Fi available and so on.  It is very welcome.  As the number of electric vehicles in the market increases, we expect that to increase.  There is an accelerated capital allowance available for businesses that wish to invest in the provision of those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1538658000,"counter":733,"content":"<p>Are they mapped?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#N00500","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":734,"content":"<p>They will be mapped shortly as the SEAI takes over the mapping of all the electric vehicle charge points.

Unfortunately, a journey that should last just two hours takes four hours due to congestion and road traffic, which is highly frustrating.<\/p> <p>  Are there policies in place to encourage the use of electric bicycles?

I am a fellow Waterford person, so I am familiar with the road, the journey from Tramore and so on that she mentioned.  Deputy Butler was also in attendance earlier.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's first point was right.  If someone ditches a diesel or petrol car for public transport or a bike, the effect from a climate change perspective will be the same as switching to EVs.  We have had many questions about EVs.  More than 50% of emissions come from private cars.  Given that our population is highly dispersed, many people will be reliant on cars where the settlement patterns make it difficult to provide public transport alternatives.<\/p><p>It is natural that a lot of the discussion tends towards these issues.  I spoke about the levels of investment and the significant increases in public transport investment over the coming years.  We have worked very hard on arguing for this investment and now that the funding is available we have to deliver, and this is a critical point.  I thank the Senator for that observation.<\/p><p> In terms of smarter travel, the lost period of investment after 2009 is probably the most significant point.  We are now back to investing heavily.  Following last year's budget we were able to announce a more than doubling of our investment in public transport over a short number of years and we were able to invest in cycling.  We have had specific questions on how much is invested in cycling.  Quite often this is very difficult to state because there are various types of vehicles on the road and various programmes.  A quality bus corridor can benefit cyclists.  Some of the investment in the Luas has also done so.  We are now able to say that this year and over the coming three years we have set aside &euro;106 million or &euro;110 million specifically for investment in city-based cycling.  Over the same period we have specified &euro;50 million to &euro;55 million for greenways.  With regard to BusConnects, which Ms Graham touched on in response to an earlier question, it is very difficult to say specifically how much of a more than &euro;2 billion investment is for the cycle lane element but we can see that in the programme more than 200 km of improvements to existing cycling lanes and routes and new routes will be delivered.

As the technologies become mass produced and more widely available, their cost will reduce and it will essentially become just a cost of replacing existing vehicles, which happens anyway.<\/p> <p>  It is true that in the national mitigation plan the incentivisation of electric vehicles is the most expensive cost on the marginal abatement cost curve.  This is because of the price differential that exists between electric and non-electric vehicles and the significant cost of incentives to try to bridge customer acceptance and cost barriers.  The cost differential is significant.  We expect that over time this cost differential will fall and it is likely that alternative fuel technologies will become cheaper to manufacture than what is required for existing vehicles.

We spoke a great deal about electric vehicles today, as Senator O'Sullivan pointed out.  We also spoke extensively about public transport not just in Dublin, in fairness, but in cities generally.  The Department and Ms Graham's organisation have done substantial work on rural transport links and the local link scheme.  The Deputy mentioned the latter, which is very active in County Donegal.<\/p> <p>  One statistic that is not official but emerges from some work we did several years ago is that traditionally the Department spent about 80% of its overall budget outside the greater Dublin area.  Considerable investment was made in roads and rail over the years.  That figure sometimes surprises people.  It will decrease in the next number of years as we invest in some of the large-scale city-based transport projects.

One aspect of the approach to the bypass that was probably different in this case was that the NTA, with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, looked at what could be done in terms of an integrated transport plan for Galway city.  This plan, which was developed in association with the plans for the bypass, has been adopted by Galway city and county councils.  There is proposed investment of &euro;200 million for BusConnects Galway to tackle congestion by improving public transport and promoting sustainable transport in Galway city.  The next stage is implementation of the strategic transport plan for Galway.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Donegal, I am sure some of the bus operators, such as John McGinley Coaches, would be disappointed to hear that the bus takes forever from Donegal.  The service is regular and popular.  Other services are also provided from Donegal.  In addition, local link in Donegal provides a significant number of services right across the Donegal.  We continue to support and try to develop even more links between towns, villages and rural areas to ensure people who may not have a car have a public transport service which will bring them to their local town.  We will continue to develop that for rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1538658000,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.<\/p> <p>  I echo the comment made about the need for visibility for the charging network for electric vehicles.  I concur with other speakers, in particular Deputy Lahart, that charging points need to become normalised and as frequent as bus stops.  They need to be part of every street in every town and village to give motorists a feeling of security.  Having chargers in view would have a psychological effect and give people a sense that they can rely on the charging network and will not be left abandoned somewhere in the middle of the night.<\/p> <p>  Transport emissions are still increasing, year on year, even though we are trying to encourage electric vehicles.  We do not seem to be making progress.  One of the reasons may be the fibs we were told by car companies about the supposed clean emissions of diesel engines.  It is concerning that emissions keep increasing.<\/p> <p>  I obviously take a Dublin centric view of transport, for which I apologise to Deputy Pringle and other members.  Some 500 buses in the Dublin Bus fleet are to be converted to lower emission vehicles.  What fuel will they use?<\/p> <p>  This ties in to the BusConnects proposals put before the people of Dublin for the revamp of their bus services.  It seems the programme will be pushed out to 2020 or 2021 because of the overwhelming number of submissions made on the plan.  More than 20,000 submissions were made by Dublin people.  This could be viewed negatively in that it creates a considerable workload but it is also a promising development.  A number of these submissions raise questions about sustainable bus transport in the city.<\/p> <p>  As I stated at one of the public consultation meetings on BusConnects, it would be a missed opportunity not to introduce electric vehicles and buses when BusConnects is being rolled out in whatever form eventually emerges.  I hope it provides certainty on bus journey times within Dublin.  Progress on electric vehicles would be positive for the city as it help us keep Dublin at least moderately clean.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, attended an environmental conference today.  He pointed out that the number of landfills around Dublin had decreased from 127 in 2011 to two large sites now.  We talked about excess waste going into the black bin and that going into landfill.  Landfill sites are set to be eliminated.  I am not sure whether this is the area of expertise of the witnesses.  I visited a recycling plant and I am not convinced that we are recycling all the items we carefully place in our bins.  Is there any possibility of using landfill sites for biofuel production?  Would the NTA buy these fuels?  Maybe that is a question for a different agency.<\/p> <p>  On park-and-ride facilities, the Red Cow is chock-a-block every day, yet when the proposal for a new national children's hospital was before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, car parking was to be downgraded on the St. James's campus and people were directed to use the Red Cow park-and-ride facility.  Staff and patients, particularly children, were told to park at the Red Cow and use the Luas to access the hospital campus.  The Red Cow facility has exceeded capacity and many people cannot access it.  Most people do not bother trying and park instead on the streets surrounding the hospital, which causes further chaos in residential areas.  Are there plans to increase capacity at the Red Cow park-and-ride facility?  How would the NTA go about doing that?  Obviously, it would have buy a large amount of land to build car parks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#R00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":780,"content":"<p>The Senator's first point on visibility and communications has come up loud and clear today and Ms Behan will take it back to the task force.  The point was well made.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding all of the efforts and work, whether in modal shift or on the uptake of technology such as biofuels, it is still the case that emissions from transport are rising.  The issue has probably been the most difficult to deal with internationally.  In Ireland, every transport trip is less emitting that it was in the past.  Emissions are not growing at the rate of demand for transport as the economy does well.  We spoke earlier about the types of trips involved.  We must manage to the greatest extent possible the growth in demand for transport, which will continue as our population grows and the economy hopefully continues to grow.  This will be done through the heavy investment we are making in public transport.  The change in technology is tremendously important for the existing scenario.  While I accept the issue cannot be split into two parts in that way, that is one way that we sometimes think about the issue in the first instance.  The Senator outlined the challenge we face.<\/p> <p>  Ms Behan will be happy to answer the question on alternative fuels.

It is likely to be a mixture of diesel hybrid and a compressed natural gas, CNG, fleet that we are about to test, with both Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, to see what are the emissions associated with that type of fleet.<\/p><p>That work will inform our procurement strategy which will start at the end of the year.  We hope the delivery of the low-emissions fleet will start late next year.  We also want to test a fully electric fleet and will do so in a small town, rather than in Dublin.  We will test to determine what all of the infrastructure costs are before we look to multiply it into a Dublin system.  Other European cities do not tend to use double-deck fleets the way we do in Ireland and the United Kingdom; therefore, we need to see whether we can have a good battery power system for a double-deck fleet.  We want to engage with manufacturers to see whether it can be delivered for the city at a reasonable price, with the infrastructure.<\/p><p> We know that we need to improve significantly park and ride facilities in the city region.  Constraining car parking within city centre areas and facilities is one of the ways to try to encourage people to use public transport, but there has to be a balance.  We have to make sure the public transport and park and ride facilities are available to allow people to make the change.

In November we expect to begin a significant trial of alternative bus technologies on routes in Dublin and Cork.  We hope to trial retrofitted buses, fully electric buses, hybrid electric buses and buses that use compressed natural gas along specific routes with similar driving patterns.  We will measure the tailpipe emissions to gain a real understanding of the carbon and air quality emissions in the context of all of the various technologies used.  We have been looking at all of the international literature which in parts has been conflicting.  It is probably fair to say we need to have a much better understanding of how the various technologies will work in an Irish context.  I refer to the way real bus routes are operated in Irish cities.  The trial will begin in November and we hope to see outcomes and results from it by the end of the first quarter of next year.  Initially, in the short run there will have to be a hybrid strategy for the urban buses.  We hope the results of the trial and our research will feed into the NTA's longer term procurement strategy as technologies improve and decisions on the necessary investment in supporting infrastructure are made.  If we transition the bus fleet in Dublin, Cork or any other city to natural gas or fully electric, significant infrastructure will be required to go along with it.  We need to gain a fuller understanding of how it will work in a real sense before we make longer term decisions.<\/p> <p>  I would like to answer the question asked about converting waste to biofuel.  A lot of the biofuel currently in petrol and diesel in Ireland comes from used cooking oil.  A lot of waste is already being deployed in biofuel in the transport sector.  The anaerobic digester in existence is using waste to produce biogas.  It is hoped it will have significant potential as the market for compressed natural gas increases.  Then we can substitute biogas for it in order to make it emit even less carbon over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1538658000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I think all of the questions have been covered adequately by most of my colleagues, but there is one point I would like the officials to address.

In essence, it is proposing different variables of measures that can impact on fuel consumption on the transport side and on heating consumption and how they affect emissions between 2021 and 2030.  The research is looking at energy use first and then emissions.  It is very difficult to extract the transport piece from that.  It is considered as an overall energy system and the modelling is conducted on that basis.  I am not sure it will be feasible to answer the Deputy's question within that timeframe.

I am not obsessed with modelling because it is difficult to model the future completely.  I am sorry to become annoyed about a personal matter but I cycle down Leeson Street every day and I am nearly killed on a regular basis.  We have a system that is completely car dominated.  More schoolgirls are driving to school than are cycling to school.  Could we model for changing that?  Could we make it safer for our children to cycle or walk to school so that 30% of our rush-hour traffic is not accounted for by children being driven to school?  This is so important in the context of diabetes and other health problems.  It is not just about modelling but also about a vision for the future, about creating a city and a country that are attractive to live in, that are efficient and that work in every way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#V00800","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":864,"content":"<p>Those points are well made and that is why we have worked so hard to get this amount of investment allocated across the various areas to which the Deputy has referred, including cycling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#V00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1538658000,"counter":865,"content":"<p>The truth is that nothing is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018100400002#V01000","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1538658000,"counter":866,"content":"<p>We have only just got the money.
