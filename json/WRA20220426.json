A national charging infrastructure strategy was published for consultation at the end of this March which sets out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2025.<\/p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022.

The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.<\/p>  <p>  While the public consultation regarding the charging infrastructure strategy is ongoing, my Department continues to engage directly with stakeholders to ensure that a sufficient number of chargers, as well as a sufficient spread of charger types, will be in place to meet demand as we move towards our 2030 target of circa 1 million EVs on the road. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600060#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600060#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[20076\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600060#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 28 of 3 March 2022, the timeline for the upcoming review of the Galway Transport Strategy; the terms of reference for the review; the timeline and terms of reference for the promised feasibility study for light rail in Galway which will be undertaken as part of the review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the review of the\u00a0Galway Transport Strategy\u00a0will commence later this year and will be led by the National Transport Authority (NTA), in cooperation with Galway City Council and Galway County Council.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I have noted previously there is a need to review the\u00a0Strategy\u00a0and take stock of developments since its publication in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0In my view,\u00a0the\u00a0feasibility study for light rail in\u00a0Galway is\u00a0best considered within the context of this review rather than carrying out a stand-alone study.\u00a0\u00a0This approach allows for a multi-modal perspective and integration within an overall land-use plan.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0review of the\u00a0Strategy\u00a0will include a comprehensive analysis of changes to population projections, development density, employment forecasts and future travel demand patterns since the finalisation of the current\u00a0Strategy.\u00a0 This analysis will be utilised to reassess the public transport needs across Galway city and\u00a0the potential role all modes of transport, including light rail, can play in meeting\u00a0those needs.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600060#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600060#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[19261\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600060#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on significantly increasing the LocalLink budget to serve significant sites of Ukrainian refugees in local areas.","asker":"1488","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":59,"content":"<p>In line with the whole of Government approach, my Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA) have been working on practical and meaningful responses to the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis.

The Scheme will provide support of &euro;100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022.  I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence.<\/p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Emergency Scheme however,\u00a0the Government has provided for an excise duty reduction on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  As such, decisions regarding a dedicated transport police unit and the allocation of Garda resources are matters for the Minister of Justice and the Garda Commissioner. I am given to understand that the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are that effective local community policing can meet the policing needs of the public transport network and that the Garda authorities do not propose to establish a specialist or dedicated transport policing unit at this time.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the Department has been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour and a significant number of actions have been taken. These include; <\/p>  <p>  - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have significantly increased their security resources with up to 20 security teams operating daily on-board and in stations (spend on security has increased from &euro;3.7 million to &euro;5.2 million pa since 2016).<\/p>  <p>  - Since May 2021, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have joined forces to tackle anti-social behaviour in the Greater Dublin Area and on the DART, Northern Line and Heuston to Portlaoise services.<\/p>  <p>  - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann liaises on a minimum quarterly basis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in major districts to address trends and issues on an area basis. <\/p>  <p>  - An Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann\/AGS inter-agency operation was established targeting incidents of graffiti and criminal damage to train carriages; as part of this operation Garda&iacute; conducted patrols of rail lines in an effort to target groups involved in this activity.<\/p>  <p>  - CCTV is available on most trains and has successfully been used on numerous occasions in securing prosecutions. They are also in place in stations.<\/p>  <p>  - A DART text alert line has been established for discrete reporting of Anti-Social incidents.<\/p>  <p>  - There has been an increase in the number of Garda response hubs (to 8) on InterCity routes to support both customers and staff.<\/p>  <p>  - Appointment of Senior Security Advisor in addition to Security Enforcement &amp;amp; Compliance Manager and Crime Prevention Officer, all of whom are former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with extensive knowledge in the area of crime and crime prevention.<\/p>  <p>  - Increased number of Prohibition Notices issued to persistent offenders across rail network.<\/p>  <p>  - Reportable ASB incidents have reduced from 654 in 2020 to 549 in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - An Garda Siochana is to co-ordinate a number of Joint Awareness Days (Operation Twin Track) on the Railway and LUAS during 2022. Joint Garda &amp;amp; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann high visibility public safety operations took place across the network over the Easter period with a number of fines issued.<\/p>  <p>  Transdev Dublin Light Rail, who operate the Luas network on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, employ 50 security staff. These staff are involved in maintaining safety and security on the Luas, along with enforcing the Luas bye-laws. They liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to security on our public bus services, the entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 11 internal cameras and three external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.<\/p>  <p>  Any instances of disruption or concerns around security are immediately reported and services are suspended as necessary. The company also has mobile inspectors in the city centre, who are available to attend incidents as required, and all Dublin Bus employees are fully trained on the comprehensive procedures for dealing with specific challenging situations including anti-social behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  Dublin Bus has also re-introduced their Schools Education Programme (previously suspended due to Covid-19) which involves educating young people about the importance of the bus in their lives and in their local community. The work of their School and Community Co-ordinators has also proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted greatly in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond this Dublin Bus has a strong and close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have set up a number of community forums in different areas across the city. These forums are made up of Dublin Bus representatives, the Garda&iacute;, local area representatives, community groups and Trade Union Representatives.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has similarly also invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required. <\/p>  <p>  All Bus &Eacute;ireann city and town buses are fitted with driver security screens. Security personnel are employed in our larger bus stations and extensive CCTV is also in operation throughout all stations to ensure the security of our staff, customers and property.  Furthermore, customer research shows that 93% of Bus &Eacute;ireann customers feel safe and secure during their journeys.<\/p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date across our public transport services have substantially helped to tackle anti-social behaviour; however, this is an issue which will require on-going monitoring. As such, I am committed to continuing to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and the safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600062#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600062#WRD01300"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[21011\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600062#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if arrangements will be put in place to ensure persons fleeing the war in Ukraine are able to exchange their driving licence for an Irish driving licence; the other measures that are intended to support their transport needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>My colleague Minister Ryan signed the Road Traffic (Recognition of Foreign Driving Licences) (Ukraine) Order 2022 into law on 22 April 2022.

In negotiations with the Commission, the Government sought the inclusion of much more of the country including Drogheda Urban.\u00a0 We will do so again at the mid-term review in 2023 when the data from the census is available. <\/p><p>In European law, Louth is part of the Mid-East Region (NUTS2) alongside Meath, Kildare and Wicklow not the Border region. Louth is the only county in the Mid-East to have any part of it included as a qualifying area in the Regional Aid Map. This is due to its proximity to the border even though it is not officially in the NUTS2 Border region. <\/p><p>Regional Aid does not involve any European money or grants and should not be confused with structural funds which Ireland qualified for in the past. Rather it limits the amount of regional state aid that the Irish exchequer can provide to certain geographic areas based on specified criteria. <\/p><p>In Drogheda, the focus was on including the areas around the town where major industrial development is most likely to occur in the future. So, the following industrial areas in Drogheda Rural do qualify. These are:\u00a0<\/p><p>- The new land acquired by IDA Ireland in June 2021. This is located in the townland of Mell and is 7.55 ha. It is located just off Junction 10 on the M1 Dublin to Belfast motorway. For regional aid purposes, this is Drogheda Rural LEA and it is included in the Regional Aid Map.<\/p><p>- Newtown Science &amp;amp; Tech Park. This is yet to be developed and it is also home to the Drogheda Enterprise Centre, a REDF funded project.<\/p><p>- Drogheda North Business Park. This is yet to be developed. <\/p><p>The Regional Aid Map for every Member State must be developed within the criteria laid down in the European Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines, issued in April 2021. Ireland&rsquo;s economy has shown strength and improvement since 2014.\u00a0 As a consequence, the European Commission proposed to reduce the overall coverage of Ireland&rsquo;s Map, as measured by proportion of total population, to 25.6%. Following intensive negotiations with the Commission, this was increased to 35.9%.\u00a0 This is a reduction of almost one third from the 51.3% which applied previously.\u00a0 This adjustment was part of a European wide review and Ireland was not unique in facing a reduction in coverage. With a more limited population coverage, and the strict criteria set by the Commission, it was important that the optimal allocation was achieved.<\/p><p>To achieve this, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, working with stakeholders, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, developed a multi-dimensional model that provided a depth of analysis within the Commission&rsquo;s set criteria.\u00a0 This was an objective and impartial approach, though final approval of the Map, for Ireland and for all Member States, rests with the European Commission. The Commission announced its decision on 22 March 2022. <\/p><p>Due to the more limited population coverage available to be allocated, several Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) identified by the multi-dimensional model could not be included. We sought to include these areas and explored all options with the European Commission, but it was not possible to include them. However, they have been recognised and listed as reserves, including Drogheda Urban, and these areas will be kept under close review with a view to including them as part of a mid-term review of the Map, which will take place in 2023. <\/p><p>Highly residential LEAs such as Drogheda Urban tend not to be areas where enterprises might develop. While Drogheda Urban LEA\u00a0is not included in the Map there is scope for positive &lsquo;spill-over&rsquo; effects for the Drogheda Urban LEA, e.g., residents of Drogheda Urban LEA can benefit from employment opportunities in neighbouring areas.\u00a0<\/p><p>LEAs not included on the map can still access all other types of State Aid. Only approximately 7.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s State Aid is in the form of Regional Aid and other aid remains available to enterprises, irrespective of their location. For example, enterprises in Drogheda-Urban LEA and other areas not included on the Regional Aid Map may still avail of Research, Development and Innovation Aid, Environmental Aid, Training Aid, and Consultancy Aid, under the General Block Exemption Regulation.\u00a0 Aid under the De Minimis Regulation, i.e., aid to an undertaking of less than &euro;200,000 in any rolling 3-year period, offers a further avenue, particularly for smaller sized grants and investments to small enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600064#WRF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600064#WRF05500"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[20289\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600064#WRF05600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the precise location of a site (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>Regional development is a priority for IDA Ireland.\u00a0 IDA Ireland is targeting 40 investments for the Mid-East region in the period 2021 to 2024.

This scheme was operated on behalf of the Department by the 31 local authorities, coordinated through their Local Government Management Agency (LGMA). <\/p><p>Mayo County Council issued &euro;20,220,373 to 3,962 applications approved for the Restart Grant. Any unused funding was returned to the Exchequer.\u00a0<\/p><p>Upon final closure of the Scheme, in line with the provisions of the Scheme Service Level Agreements, an independent audit was commissioned to provide reasonable assurance as to the implementation, monitoring and control of the Scheme and reasonable assurance as to the appropriate administration, disbursement and reconciliation of the funding provided by the Exchequer for the Scheme. This is expected to be concluded shortly.<\/p><p>Under the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), which was open for application in 2021, Mayo County Council received the following monies over two phases. <\/p><p>(i) It received an initial allocation of &euro;734,210, of which &euro;521,000 was expended and the remaining &euro;213,210 was then brought forward to phase 2.\u00a0 <\/p><p>(ii) In phase 2 of the scheme, the council received an additional &euro;532,137, giving it a total funding for that phase of &euro;745,347. Of this, &euro;361,000 was expended and\u00a0&euro;384,347 was returned unspent to the Exchequer. <\/p><p>The total spend over the two phases therefore amounted to &euro;882,000 under the scheme. The SBASC scheme was developed specifically for businesses who were not eligible for CRSS because generally they were not open to the general public, such as wholesalers, caterers, etc. Money was allocated to local authorities on the assumption that such businesses numbered about 20% of CRSS-eligible businesses in each local authority area, which proved to be an overestimate nationwide. Furthermore, the significant reopening of the economy which the government permitted following public health advice from 10 May 2021 also greatly reduced demand for the scheme.\u00a0 For these reasons, only slightly more than one third of the funds originally sanctioned for the scheme were ultimately spent nationwide. 231 applicants in Mayo benefited from grant aid under the scheme. An independent audit of the scheme is currently in progress and an evaluation will be undertaken at a later date.<\/p><p>Mayo County Council was approved funding of &euro;15,000 in September 2019 by Enterprise Ireland to undertake a feasibility study under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund. The funding was approved for an options analysis on the former Volex building in Castlebar.\u00a0In 2020 a business approached Mayo County Council about renting the remaining section of the Volex building. Mayo County Council was amenable to this approach and did not proceed with the Feasibility study. No payment was made by Enterprise Ireland to Mayo County Council under this grant offer.<\/p><p>The table below sets out the funding allocated to Mayo County Council in respect of their Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) for the period from 1st January 2017 to date.

One of the main issues raised at that meeting was concern over energy security and prices.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has already implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of energy price increases including reductions in VAT and excise on some fuels, as well as a temporary grant scheme to hauliers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is part of a whole of Government response to the economic and social impacts of rising energy costs and is leading on the Government response to the business impacts of this, in particular. <\/p>  <p>  Government Departments have been consulting with stakeholders on specific measures that could be considered to ameliorate the short to medium term challenges to energy security. The Energy Supply Emergency Group is an inter-departmental and inter-agency group with responsibility for informing the Government response to the impact of rising energy costs on business, in addition to security of energy supply more generally, and a longer-term reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported oil and gas.<\/p>  <p>Under the aegis of this Group, my Department has established the Business Energy Users Sub-Group to lead on consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action. The work of this sub-group, as part of the wider Energy Supply Emergency Group has informed the National Energy Security Framework which was launched by the Government on 13th   April 2022 and which sets out how Government can help households and businesses with their energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of business impacts, the Framework notes the European Commission&rsquo;s recently launched State Aid Temporary Crisis Framework for businesses affected by the energy-related aspects of the Ukraine crisis, and the opportunity that this presents to Member States to consider what specific instruments and supports might be needed in the near-term in order to help vulnerable but viable businesses to overcome the acute impacts of the current crisis. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of short-term temporary supports for businesses, there are already a number of effective schemes in place resulting from Government&rsquo;s response to the Brexit and Covid-19 crises, and the Government will now be considering whether, and to what degree, such schemes might be pivoted to firms impacted by the Ukraine crisis. In the near term, businesses will be also looking for signals and reassurance that underlying capacity and security of supply issues are being improved in a strategic manner and in collaboration with authorities across the EU and the UK; and the Government will provide clear and practical guidance to business users on ways of maximising their energy efficiency and thus helping to manage overall levels of demand across our energy networks. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan, Irish businesses and industry have already embarked on an ambitious plan of action to transition away from fossil fuels and make their operations more efficient and sustainable. This has required a strategic, medium and longer-term approach to business positioning and investment, and the pace of such investment will now need to be accelerated as this can also address Ireland&rsquo;s relative dependency on imported energy, and in doing so, secure our energy future.<\/p>  <p>  I would also encourage firms to take this opportunity to achieve greater energy efficiency and to begin their decarbonisation transition. For example, the Climate Toolkit for Businesses helps firms understand their current carbon footprint and under the EU's National Recovery and Resilience Fund, later this year we will be able to help SMEs through the Climate Enterprise Action Fund. There are also a range of supports available for business from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to improve energy efficiency and to reduce energy costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600065#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":357,"content":"<p>Question No. 215 answered with Question No. 214.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600065#WRG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[21153\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600065#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will report on the work of his Department on the second national action plan on business and human rights.","asker":"1628","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>Ireland's first National Plan on Business and Human Rights 2017-2020 was launched by the Department of Foreign Affairs towards the end of 2017.

RESS includes a mandated Community Benefit Fund payment, valued at &euro;2 per MWh of electricity generated,\u00a0which guarantees\u00a0local community participation and benefit in all projects supported by RESS.\u00a0The scheme will be supplemented by the new Micro-Generation Support Scheme to facilitate communities further\u00a0in their energy transition. <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made to date in advancing offshore wind. The enactment of the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021, establishes a well-regulated and inclusive consenting process which includes meaningful community engagement. The Act\u00a0also balances the harnessing of our huge offshore wind potential with protecting our marine environment. The application process for Maritime Area Consents (MACs), which will be issued to projects on foot of the MAP legislation, opens later this month. In respect of the decommissioning of infrastructure, the MAP Act also\u00a0sets out obligations on holders of a MAC in relation to the rehabilitation of the maritime area. <\/p>  <p>  Preparations are also now advanced to launch, later this year, Ireland's first auction specifically for offshore wind projects, ORESS 1.

An Post has statutory responsibility for the State&rsquo;s postal service and the post office network. In addition, Irish post offices are typically independent businesses that are run by postmasters. Decisions relating to the network, including those in relation to the size, distribution and future of the network are operational matters for the Board and management of the company. The Government is committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure throughout Ireland. The company fully understands the Government position and a sustainable, viable and customer-focused post office network is a key strategic priority for the company. <\/p>  <p>  The transformation programme that was agreed with the Irish Postmasters Union in 2018, was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. An Post introduced the pandemic recovery fund in 2021, which was worth &euro;8.5 million over an 18-month period. This commenced on 1 July 2021 and will continue until the end of this year. The Government recognises the importance of the high value and high quality post office network to our citizens right across the country, as well as the central and trusted role of postmasters in our communities. An Post, including through the post office network provides important services to its customers and it is contracted to provide key Government services to citizens. <\/p>  <p>  The work of the interdepartmental group, which was established to consider the feasibility of the new Government services, is being considered at present and the report of the Group will be brought to Government when all options have been considered. While decisions relating to the network are matters for the board and the management of the company, they continue to engage with the IPU on operational matters. The Government is committed to ensuring that An Post continues to play a vital role. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have ongoing engagement with the company, with other Departments and with key stakeholders to explore all options, in line with this commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600067#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":464,"content":"<p>Question No. 248 answered with Question No. 247.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":465,"content":"<p>Question No. 249 answered with Question No. 247.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600067#WRJ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[19547\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600067#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will provide the details of the name, salary, position and roles of persons who are being paid for by his Department for secondment to another public, private or semi-private entity in tabular form following the announcement that the salary of a person (details supplied) being seconded to Trinity College, Dublin will be paid by the Department of Health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1606","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[19867\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600067#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will outline all of the secondment arrangements within his Department; the conditions related to such secondments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[20060\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600067#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of persons currently employed in his Department who have been seconded in from the public sector; the number of Departmental officials seconded where the monies are recouped from the body the person is seconded to or where the Department pays for the person with no recoupment from the other organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[20640\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600067#WRJ02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of staff within his Department who availed of a secondment from January 2019 to date on the basis that it was not the intention of the staff member to return to their position within the Department.","asker":"1466","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250, 263, 276 and 307 together.<font color=\"#333333\"> <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#333333\">The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the table below:<\/font><\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>As of 25\/4\/22<\/th>       <th>On Payroll<\/th>       <th>Gross Salary Cost to the Dept<\/th>       <th>Not on Payroll<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Seconded In <\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>&euro;514,000<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Seconded Out <\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>&euro;203,236.80<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>As of 25\/4\/22<\/th>       <th>Civil Service<\/th>       <th>Public Service<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Seconded In<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Seconded Out<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><font color=\"#333333\">My Department does not provide individual<\/font>identifiable data such as staff names which are considered to be personal data.<\/p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Secondments in my Department are managed in line with the DPER Secondment Policy for the Civil Service 2021 and guideline&rsquo;s and procedures governing secondments between civil and public service organisations and are reviewed on a regular basis.

This decision did not impose a moratorium on data centres, but rather directed the System Operators to implement a set of assessment criteria by which to process data centre grid connection applications. Given the constraint situation in the greater Dublin Region, and the number of data centres applying for connection to the greater Dublin Region, the CRU considered it necessary to introduce a locational criterion in the Directions to the SOs which requires the SOs to take into consideration the effects of connecting data centres inside constrained areas before further processing data centre applications, in order to mitigate further constraint issues in this area and any other area that may be identified by the SOs as constrained in future.

The Government has also put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year to address the increasing cost of energy including:<\/p><p>&middot;Following on from the Budget 2022 increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March. <\/p><p>&middot;All residential electricity customers will see the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;200 (incl. VAT) credited to their accounts. <\/p><p>&middot;The National Retrofit Scheme includes specific measures to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation. <\/p><p>To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, has also announced a number of additional supports for consumers and businesses including:<\/p><p>-A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.<\/p><p>-A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.<\/p><p>-A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.<\/p><p>-The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.<\/p><p>-A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.<\/p><p>-An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>-The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.<\/p><p>In addition to the measures outlined above, the electricity and gas markets, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.<\/p><p>A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Generation","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[20334\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the progress that has been made to date in bringing forward legislation to facilitate micro-generation of electricity by householders and the export of any excess to the grid for payment.","asker":"1491","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[20556\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans and indicative timeframe regarding the purchase of and payment for excess electricity generated by PV panels located on homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[20779\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the new micro-generation scheme will be introduced; the form that it will take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290, 296 and 315 together.On 15 February this year I signed the Regulations (Statutory Instrument 76 of 2022),\u00a0that transpose Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive into Irish law. These Regulations create an obligation on suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. I are aware that some suppliers have already advertised their CEG tariffs.The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. More information is available here: www.cru.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/CRU21131-Interim-Clean-Export-Guarantee-Decision-Paper.pdf. Micro-generators who wish to become eligible should register for an export grid connection from ESB Networks (Micro-Generators (esbnetworks.ie)) and have a smart meter where applicable (Smart Meter Upgrade FAQs (esbnetworks.ie)).<\/p><p>The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Once eligible, customers can expect an initial payment or credit from their suppliers from 1 July depending on billing cycle. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision on when initial Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payments will be made &ndash; at the earliest opportunity.The CRU encourages customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers CEG tariff arrangements.<\/p><p>In addition,the phased introduction of supports has already begun with the commencement by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) of the MSS domestic solar PV grant on 16 February last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Schemes","counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL01900"},{"type":"question","counter":584,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[20339\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason that there are far more grants available to the SEAI one stop shop scheme (details supplied).","asker":"1485","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>In line with commitments in\u00a0the National Retrofit Plan,\u00a0the Government\u00a0recently launched\u00a0a package of significantly improved supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and lower emissions. The supports include a new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme\u00a0offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the previous level of 30-35%). SEAI registered\u00a0One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for\u00a0homeowners through this scheme.   When a homeowner is completing a whole home energy upgrade, the overall fabric of the home is assessed through the home energy survey and assessment. The assessment may recommend upgrading certain measures to ensure that home achieves a B2 rating or is suitable for installation of a heat pump. It is in these situations that certain measures, such as floor insulation, which are not available as an individual grant measure, are eligible for support through the One-Stop-Shop service. The provision of these additional measures as part of a whole home energy upgrade, represents a continuation of the approach that was previously in place under schemes like the Community Energy Grants scheme as opposed to any change in policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has made it clear that it is important that households that want or need to carry out the upgrade over time instead of all at once, should also be supported. For that reason, the new\u00a0enhanced grant\u00a0rates have also been applied to the individual measure grants allowing homeowners to take a step-by-step approach or self-manage the project. A special grant covering 80% of the cost of attic and cavity wall insulation has also been made available as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to increases in the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emissions reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme\u00a0will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the SEAI and the Department. A comprehensive evaluation measuring effectiveness and value will also take place in 2023 and will inform future developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600069#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":586,"content":"<p>Question

They will introduce minimum standards that will apply across all solid fuels, to ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and to assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives. New measures are required to improve air quality and protect public health. It is estimated that each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning and that there are over 16,200 life years lost. In addition, many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. The regulations are a critical element of addressing this public health and environmental challenge and will serve to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.<\/p><p>I am acutely aware of recent increases in energy costs due to increases internationally and, more recently, due to the crisis in Ukraine. The purpose of new solid fuel regulations is to ensure that better quality, more efficient fuels will be available on the market. Low smoke ovoids are a suitable cost-efficient alternative to other types of high polluting coal, peat and wood logs, in terms of heat delivered per cent cost. <\/p><p>While there is no detailed information available regarding the number of people who purchase peat, the 2016 census data indicates that approximately 5.4% of households relied upon peat as a main heating fuel,\u00a0though this varies significantly at a county level. Nationally it is estimated that 128ktoe of peat\u00a0are used for heating purposes.<\/p><p>The primary focus of these regulations is on the large-scale commercial sale of turf. I recognise that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatland areas. Measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat, but which respect these traditions. No ban on the burning of peat will be introduced for those with rights to harvest sod peat, but measures are required to reduce its availability in more urban areas where the greatest harm can be caused. To that end, provision\u00a0is proposed\u00a0to prohibit the commercial sale of sod peat in areas with higher population density while allowing for traditional distribution in rural areas. This approach will facilitate those with turbary rights and traditional rural usage to continue to cut and burn sod peat for their own domestic purposes, while also reducing the use of sod peat in urban areas.<\/p><p>Final regulations will be agreed by Government in due course that will ensure, that while measures are introduced to enhance the quality of our air, they will not impinge upon traditional local practices associated with sod peat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600070#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Schemes","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600070#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[20667\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600070#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if any consideration has been given to prioritising retrofits for households that still burn solid fuels for heating and hot water; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>The Warmer Homes Scheme\u00a0offers free energy upgrades for eligible homeowners who are most at risk of energy poverty.

Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The major cuts to funding for regional and local roads during the post 2008 recession resulted in the build-up of a substantial backlog of works across the country.  The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion. <\/p>  <p>  Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, approximately 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities for regional and local roads is being directed to maintenance and renewal works rather than for new roads or for road realignments.<\/p>  <p>  While funding is not at a level that would allow the backlog of roadworks across the country to be addressed, there has been significant increases in Exchequer grants for regional and local roads particularly in the recent years. The 2022 allocation for regional and local roads is &euro;597 million approximately - &euro;46m Current and &euro;551m Capital. This represents an increase of about 46% compared to 2017.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the basis for allocating grants, within the available budget, the Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility with some account taken of traffic. It is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  Basing regional and local roads grant allocations on road conditions could result in an uneven distribution of Exchequer funding. For example, local authorities that allocate higher levels of own resources funding to regional and local roads will have a larger proportion of roads with a higher condition rating than those with lower levels of own resources funding. Basing allocations on road condition could therefore disincentivise local authorities from allocating own resources funding to roads maintenance.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I appreciate that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that Exchequer funding for regional and local roads is intended to supplement realistic contributions from local authorities&rsquo; own resources.

I have established a daily crisis management meeting between the Department and daa to monitor the situation.<\/p>  <p>  The company has undertaken significant work to address and mitigate the security queue times at Dublin Airport. It has put in place a number of measures including stepping up recruitment efforts; redeployment of staff where possible; establishing a senior management taskforce; opening security lanes on a 24\/7 basis and enhancing communications with passengers. These measures are having a positive impact on passenger queue times at the airport. This positive impact was seen over the Easter weekend, even as passenger numbers reached around 200,000 departing passengers between Good Friday and Easter Monday. The vast majority of passengers went through security in under 40 minutes, and no passenger missed their flight as a result of security delays.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 April daa published revised advice for passengers following consistently improved queuing times over the last few weeks, including over Easter weekend. Passengers are now advised to arrive at the airport up to 2.5 hours before the departure of short-haul flights to Europe and the UK. The recommendation for long-haul passengers remains up to 3.5 hours.<\/p>  <p>  While recruitment remains ongoing, over 100 new security staff have been recruited recently and this should assist in the alleviation of the excessive queue times over the coming period.  These security staff are being deployed following the necessary training.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Airport is planning for a significant increase in passenger volumes over the coming months.   It does note that this increase will present a considerable challenge. Management is reviewing the experience of the last number of weeks to further develop and refine measures to cater for the increased passenger numbers. I will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days and weeks and continue to engage with daa to ensure the positive impacts seen recently are maintained for passengers using Dublin Airport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[19378\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if an aircraft (details supplied) was approved by his Department to transport United States soldiers or arms or munitions through Shannon Airport; and if he will provide the details of same.","asker":"1579","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>An exemption permitting the carriage of munitions of war by civil aircraft, pursuant to Article 5 of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders, 1973 and 1989, was not issued to the air operator in question on the dates specified by the Deputy.<\/p><p>My department has no role in relation to the transport of soldiers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":723,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO03900"},{"type":"question","counter":724,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[19382\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will allocate funding for safety works on a bus corridor (details supplied).","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":725,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.\u00a0 The\u00a0National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure, including BusConnects.<\/p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a direct reply.\u00a0 Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within\u00a010 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO04200"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[19427\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600072#WRO04300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of negotiations on CI&Eacute; pensions (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>The CI&Eacute; Group has two pension schemes, namely the Regular Wages Scheme (\"RWS\") and 1951 superannuation scheme (\"1951 Scheme\") and issues in relation to CI&Eacute; pension schemes are primarily a matter for the trustees of the schemes, the CI&Eacute; Group and their employees.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the RWS, CI&Eacute; has prepared and submitted draft Statutory Instruments (SIs) to give effect to the proposed changes to the Regular Wages Scheme (RWS).

A number of ports, both large ones for construction and deployment and smaller ports for operations and maintenance activities, will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments. <\/p>  <p>  This will also maximise the economic benefits at both regional and national level in terms of job creation and new SME enterprises in areas such as engineering, fabrication, transport and logistics, and other technologies.<\/p>  <p>  As part of endeavours to maximise EU funding, following extensive engagement with other Member States and the Commission, the Department successfully obtained changes to the Ten-T CEF criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE in the next 2021-2023 funding stream. Successful applicants can obtain significant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent call which closed on 19th January makes &euro;4bn funding available EU wide for transport infrastructure projects. Similar calls are expected in 2022 and 2023.  These are competitive processes, and typically oversubscribed.  Bearing in mind the confidential nature of the process, individual applications cannot be commented on. However, four ports\/private entities that are eligible under TEN-T applied this year for funding for studies which will effectively allow them to prepare for lodgement of planning applications from 2022 onwards for ORE port developments. It is expected that a decision on the applications will be made in July this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Department assisted, as appropriate, eligible applicants with the application process. It is important for the State that preparatory work is advanced and planning applications submitted so that the entities will be ready to go to construction, once they have more certainty from developers that have come through the ORESS auction.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the ORE Ports Policy Statement, in March 2022, the department established a Ports Co-ordination Group to ensure alignment of policy and to monitor its implementation.  The overall objective of the Group is to ensure that ports develop infrastructure to facilitate the ORE sector in line with Government Policy and foster the growth of the related supply chain. The Group will provide a forum for port related ORE facilitation issues to be raised and to promote the sharing of information and best practices in relation to ORE facilitation issues.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the group include representatives of the ports and terminal operators, officials from the Departments of Transport, Environment, Climate and Communications, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the IMDO.  The terms of reference also provide that the Group, where appropriate, can invite other agencies, Departments or stakeholders (industry developers, turbine manufacturers, other ports) to attend meetings and present to the Group.  <\/p>  <p>  The first meeting of the Port Coordination group was held on 31 March 2021.  Officials from the three participating Departments provided updates in relation to their respective policy matters. Ports and terminal operators identified issues which were relevant to them and there was discussion on the preparation of a Roadmap which will set out the ports&rsquo; role in supporting the development of the ORE sector in Ireland.

Despite significant price increases in the wholesale market over the last 12 months, ESB has not increased its prices since it introduced pay for use on the public charging network in October 2019.

The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years, to facilitate the expansion of EVs in the Irish car fleet. A draft National Charging Infrastructure Strategy has been published for public consultation which sets out a pathway for the provision of charging infrastructure to stay ahead of demand.<\/p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include multi-unit dwellings. This scheme will be launched shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The Infrastructure Strategy proposes that for those who cannot charge at home, provision of residential charging solutions that give the same benefits and mirror the home charging option should be the first objective.<\/p>  <p>  There is an onus on national and local government to facilitate the provision of these charging solutions for citizens who do not have access to a home charge point.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy proposes a new Residential charging scheme that will replace the existing Public Points scheme. It is envisaged that this new scheme will provide significant co-funding of 75% to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, as well as the delivery and installation of these networks which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points. <\/p>  <p>  To coordinate the provision of EV supports and grants and the delivery of charging infrastructure, the Government will establish an office of Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) within the Department of Transport in Summer 2022. ZEVI will coordinate and support the development and roll-out of publicly accessible charging infrastructure. ZEVI will therefore provide co-funding to support Local Authorities in developing local area network plans for EV infrastructure. I anticipate that the Residential Charging Scheme will be open to applications for funding  later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600074#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600074#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[20133\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600074#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will examine the frequency of transport services (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":820,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for the scheduling of those services.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the frequency and capacity of  public transport services to the NTA for direct reply.

The research noted that all of the safest European countries, except the UK,  require motorists to carry a warning triangle, and only Norway require them to carry a high-visibility vest.

There were also issues around whether the owner or the driver (or both) of a vehicle would be committing an offence if a vehicle did not carry the required safety equipment.  Further concerns were raised around the standard of equipment which motorists would purchase if minimum standards were not laid down in legislation, which in turn could lead to further enforcement difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons it was agreed that while it is a good idea for vehicles to carry basic safety equipment, it was not feasible to set it down in legislation.

This intervention alone will result in:<\/p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two\u00a0vehicles - \u00a0Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.<\/p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.<\/p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work\u00a0is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers\u00a0have now been successfully replaced.<\/p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project including the rollout of charge points in each county can be found at\u00a0esb.ie\/ecars\/our-network\/network-upgrades.\u00a0While the ESB network information is available, there are a number of private charge point operators with sites already live in Ireland. One of the expected tasks of ZEVI will be to collate information about the various networks available to the public and offer a central source of information to EV owners.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the draft Infrastructure Strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks.

The decision was informed by a detailed appraisal and business case prepared by KPMG for the Department of Transport. The business case presented to Government set out the strategic case for a new service. It considered the range of options for how such a service could be delivered, including the potential for the Air Corps to provide an element of the service as a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; option alongside another civil operator. It also set out an implementation plan to achieve the desired service. The detailed appraisal included a financial and economic appraisal of short-listed options, with an assessment of costs, benefits, affordability, deliverability, risks and sensitivities associated with the options. The approval of the business case was one of the key steps required in the Public Spending Code (PSC).<\/p>  <p>  Provision has been made in the procurement documentation to allow the Air Corps to undertake the fixed wing element of the new service at some point during the contract term. Discussions with Department of Defence are ongoing in relation to this aspect.<\/p>  <p>  The procurement process is being conducted in accordance with &lsquo;Competitive Procedure with Negotiation&rsquo; (CPN) under the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulation 2016 (S.I. 284 of 2016). The first stage of the process &ndash; Prequalification - is reaching a conclusion and Candidates will be notified of the outcome in the coming weeks.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, Stage 2 of the procurement process will commence, when a Request for Tenders (RFT) will issue to those Candidates, which, at Prequalification Stage of the Competition, were determined to have the technical capability, and economic and financial standing to perform the contract. <\/p>  <p>  I would envisage publication of the business case will occur at the appropriate juncture in line with the Public Spending Code. However, at this stage the business case is an integral part of the procurement process and cannot be published at this time as it contains information which is commercially sensitive or could prejudice the outcome of the procurement process.\u00a0 This is a requirement to ensure all tender competitions are competitive.\u00a0 Making the Business Case, or associated financial analysis, available at this time could jeopardise not only the integrity of the process but tie our evaluators&rsquo; hands in striking the best deal possible for the Coast Guard and the taxpayer. There is a risk that even at a private hearing of Oireachtas Committees, discussions could breach EU principles on transparency, by virtue of the fact that the Department could be perceived to be influenced in its approach to particular tenderers by public representatives' representations. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may wish to be aware that my Department has already published a significant amount of non-financial and\/or non-commercially sensitive material which collectively provides a clear and comprehensive outline of the project, including the strategic rationale, options considered and the recommended procurement strategy.

I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence.<\/p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Emergency Scheme however,\u00a0the Government has provided for an excise duty reduction on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March. This saw a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel,\u00a0 proposed to last until 31 August 2022. On 11 April the Government extended the period of the reduced excise rates out to Budget Day. This measure is a benefit to all citizens and business to mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.<\/p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis.\u00a0Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we must continue the progress we have made to date on the implementation of climate policies which are critical\u00a0to ensuring we reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.<\/p>  <p>  In light of these last two factors, it is important that haulage and other businesses now engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their products and services to reflect the increasing costs.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measures, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600078#WRU03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600078#WRU03700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":1069,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600078#WRU03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1070,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[19327\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600078#WRU03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on a primary medical certificate appeal for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1071,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.<\/p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain charitable organisations.

However, in its recommendations, the Commission concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer of the child only. A feature of the One-Parent Family Tax Credit was that it could be claimed by multiple individuals in respect of the same child, resulting in an unsustainable position.<\/p><p>The One-Parent Family Tax Credit was replaced with the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit (SPCCC) from 1 January 2014. The current value of the credit is &euro;1,650 per annum. In addition to the credit, a qualifying claimant is entitled to an additional &euro;4,000 on the standard rate income tax band. <\/p><p>However, the credit is more strategically targeted, in that it will in the first instance only be available to the principal carer of the child, who has a qualifying child resident with him or her for the whole or greater part of the tax year and who satisfies the other conditions of the relief. To qualify as a single person for the purposes of the\u00a0SPCCC, the claimant must not be jointly assessed for income tax as a married person or civil partner, or be living with his or her spouse or civil partner. An individual can only receive one\u00a0SPCCC\u00a0irrespective of the number of qualifying children residing with him or her. <\/p><p>If both parents have equal custody (by court order) and the child resides with each parent for an equal part of the tax year, the primary claimant is the parent who is in receipt of\u00a0Child Benefit\u00a0from the Department of Social Protection. However, it should be noted that this &lsquo;tie-breaker&rsquo; test is only relevant for the purposes of determining a primary claimant for this credit in the unusual situation where the child resides with each parent for an equal amount of time. <\/p><p>A primary claimant can relinquish entitlement to the\u00a0SPCCC\u00a0to a secondary claimant. The secondary claimant can then claim the credit if he or she qualifies as a single person and the qualifying child resides with him or her for at least 100 days throughout the tax year. Detailed information on the SPCCC can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website at link: www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-41.pdf which may be of interest to the Deputy.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the SPCCC in its current form is targeting limited State resources to where they are most needed.

The Programme for Government contains commitments to: <\/p><p>- Review\u00a0the policy framework within which credit unions operate;  <\/p><p>- Enable\u00a0and support the credit union movement to grow;\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Support credit unions in the expansion of services, to encourage community development; <\/p><p>- Enable the\u00a0credit union movement to grow as a key provider of community banking in the country.<\/p><p><b>Review of the Policy Framework<\/b><\/p><p>With regard to fulfilling the commitments in the Programme for Government for credit unions, the Review of the Policy Framework has been completed following a recent\u00a0engagement session with all the credit union representative bodies. The proposals arising from the Review received broad support from the representative bodies and will go to Cabinet shortly for approval to draft legislation.\u00a0\u00a0The proposals being considered\u00a0aim to\u00a0better position credit unions to grow as a key provider of community banking.<\/p><p>In developing these proposals Minister of State Sean Fleming TD has met the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers Association, the National Supervisors Forum, the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the CEO Forum, collaborative ventures and many individual credit unions. In total, Minister of State Fleming has held over 40 stakeholder meetings with the credit union sector and well over 100 proposals were considered.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I will refer specifically to the creation of a regulatory and legislative credit union policy committee. Both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank already have a very substantial programme of engagement with the representative bodies. One example of this is the Credit Union stakeholder roundtable chaired by the Department, which facilitates dialogue between all the representative bodies, the Central Bank and the Department.\u00a0 The proposals will seek to support engagement between credit unions, the Department and the Central Bank, whilst respecting the Central Bank&rsquo;s independence.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The proposal to establish a business model taskforce is not being progressed as there is no legislative barrier for credit unions to create such a taskforce at present. It would also not be appropriate for Government to have a role in setting the business model for credit unions, which are owned by their members.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In terms of supporting the sector to provide essential financial services to local communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to grow and fulfil a role in relation to community banking.\u00a0 <\/p><p><b>Lending and Investment<\/b><\/p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years\u00a0reviewed both the lending and investment frameworks for credit unions.\u00a0New lending regulations were introduced on 1 January 2020.<\/p><p>Credit unions can provide 7.5% of their assets to mortgage and SME lending - approximately &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0Credit unions have the capacity to lend an additional &euro;1.1 billion in mortgage and SME loans. Further additional lending capacity is available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>As of December 2021, credit unions had\u00a0a combined mortgage and SME loan book of\u00a0circa &euro;408 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year. \u00a0<\/p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). Three credit union backed funds have\u00a0received approval from the Central Bank.\u00a0Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will\u00a0subsequently\u00a0lend\u00a0to AHBs.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>SME Lending\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>Nineteen credit unions\u00a0were approved in early 2021 for\u00a0participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further, in November 2021 five credit unions were announced as participants in the\u00a0Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). <\/p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 9.5% year on year to end\u00a0December 2021.\u00a0 Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. <\/p><p><b>Other Services<\/b><\/p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must receive approval from the Central Bank.\u00a0 <\/p><p>69 credit unions\u00a0are approved to\u00a0provide current accounts.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank has commenced a public consultation seeking views from stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600079#WRV01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1102,"content":"<p>Question No. 479 answered with Question No. 478.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1103,"content":"<p>Question No. 480 answered with Question No. 478.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600079#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1105,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[19548\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600079#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the details of the name, salary, position and roles of persons who are being paid for by his Department for secondment to another public, private or semi-private entity in tabular form following the announcement that the salary of a person (details supplied) being seconded to Trinity College, Dublin will be paid by the Department of Health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1606","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1106,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are currently six employees of the Department of Finance seconded to other organisations who continue to be paid by my Department.<\/p><p>These employees are seconded as follows: <\/p><p>-<b>Department of Foreign Affairs <\/b><\/p><p>- London Embassy <\/p><p>- Assistant Secretary x 1 <\/p><p>- Finance Attach&eacute; (Assistant Principal - AP) x 1 <\/p><p>- Berlin Embassy <\/p><p>- Finance Attach&eacute; (AP) x 1 <\/p><p>-<b>EU Commission <\/b><\/p><p>- Seconded National Expert (AP) x 2 <\/p><p>-<b>OECD <\/b><\/p><p>- Economic &amp;amp; Finance Attach&eacute; (AP) x 1<\/p><p>These employees have remained on the payroll of the Department as the roles they occupy remain directly in the purview and strategic interest of the Department of Finance.

MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is proportionate to the carbon dioxide emissions of the fuel concerned and is commonly referred to as carbon tax. The non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. <\/p><p>The Deputies will be aware that the 2020 Programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030. I followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in Finance Act 2020 to provide for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of carbon dioxide by 2030. This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. Carbon tax increases are scheduled to apply to petrol and diesel on Budget night and on all other mineral oils on 1 May each year to 2030.<\/p><p>Diesel used for certain purposes, for example in agricultural machinery, may qualify for a reduced rate of MOT. Such diesel must be marked with prescribed fiscal markers and is referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO), green diesel or farm\/agricultural diesel. The current reduced rate of MOT that applies to MGO is &euro;120.55 per 1,000 litres. This is considerably less than the standard rate of MOT on diesel used as a propellant which is currently &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres.<\/p><p>In March this year, in response to the global fuel crisis, I introduced cuts to MOT rates on petrol, diesel and MGO. I intend to introduce a further cut to the MOT rate on MGO from 1 May to run until 11 October this year.  This rate cut will be applied to the non-carbon component of MOT to fully compensate for a scheduled increase in the carbon component. The rate of MOT on MGO will be almost 30% lower from 1 May than the rate that would have applied had I not provided for relevant cuts. As a result of the measures I introduced, all MGO users will benefit from a cut of more than 5 cents per litre inclusive of VAT from 1 May until 11 October. The table below provides the current MOT rate, broken into its carbon and non-carbon components, along with the pre-cut rate and the rate to apply when the temporary reduction period ends.  <table>    <tr>       <th>MOT   rate on MGO from<\/th>       <th>MOT   non-carbon<\/th>       <th>MOT   carbon<\/th>       <th>Total   MOT<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-21<\/td>       <td>&euro;47.36<\/td>       <td>&euro;90.81<\/td>       <td>&euro;138.17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10-Mar-22<\/td>       <td>&euro;29.74<\/td>       <td>&euro;90.81<\/td>       <td>&euro;120.55<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-22<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;111.14<\/td>       <td>&euro;111.14<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12-Oct-22<\/td>       <td>&euro;47.36<\/td>       <td>&euro;111.14<\/td>       <td>&euro;158.50<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>In addition to benefiting from the enhanced, reduced MOT rate on MGO (farm\/green diesel), farmers and agricultural\/forestry contractors may also claim a tax deduction for expenditure incurred on MGO (including any MOT charged) in computing their taxable profits. In computing their taxable farming profits, farmers may also benefit from a relief provided under Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This relief allows a farmer to claim an additional deduction for MGO which amounts to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline). <\/p><p>The relief under section 664A is available to any person carrying on a trade of farming in the State. Agricultural\/forestry contractors are not entitled to this relief as they are not carrying on a trade of farming which, as defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, requires the occupation of farmland. However, as outlined above, such contractors may claim tax deduction for expenditure incurred on fuel costs when calculating their taxable profits.<\/p><p>It is also worth mentioning that MOT law provides for a relief from the carbon component of MOT for biofuels that are made of biomass of animal or vegetal origin. This means that a fuel that is entirely made from biomass would be liable for the non-carbon component of MOT only.

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended) and this Act provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels. <\/p><p>The Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) was introduced in 2013 with the aim of providing support to road haulage and bus transport operators when the retail price of diesel is relatively high. The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 per litre excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. <\/p><p>The DRS operates as a State Aid under Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a0651\/2014, commonly referred to as the General Block Exemption Regulation. The DRS allows qualifying operators to benefit from an effective lower rate of MOT than other diesel users. While this application of a differentiated MOT rate on diesel for certain commercial uses is allowed under Articles 7.2 and 7.3 of the ETD, the ETD minimum rate, currently &euro;330 per 1,000 litres, must still be complied with. This means that the effective MOT rate is what is considered in terms of compliance with ETD minimum. The effective MOT rate is determined by reducing the actual MOT rate by the maximum DRS repayment rate. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that a repayment under the DRS may only be made to licensed road haulage and bus transport operators who purchase diesel in the State for use in qualifying motor vehicles. Operators established in the State must hold either an international operator&rsquo;s licence or a national operator&rsquo;s licence issued under the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006. In addition operators must provide proof of tax compliance; either a valid Tax Clearance Certificate issued by Revenue or written proof of tax compliance in the form of a letter from the tax authority of another Member State where the operator&rsquo;s road licence was issued. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in March this year, in response to the current fuel crisis, I introduced a significant reduction of 15 cents inclusive of VAT on MOT for diesel. I will shortly bring forward legislation to extend this rate cut until 11 October. \u00a0A further reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT was applied from 1 April and this will also run until 11 October. <\/p><p>This means that the current rate of MOT, &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres, is &euro;75.38 over the ETD minimum rate of &euro;330 per 1,000 litres. However, when the DRS is taken into account the effective MOT rate is only &euro;0.38 per 1,000 litres above the ETD minimum. It is for this reason that I have no scope under EU law to make any further material cuts to the MOT rate on diesel. Recent MOT rate changes are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons between actual and effective MOT rates and the ETD minimum rate. <\/p><p>The Government has also provided an &euro;18m package of emergency support measures for licenced hauliers to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. This targeted and temporary grant scheme will provide a payment of &euro;100 per week for every heavy goods vehicle (over 3.5 tonnes) as listed on a road haulage operator&rsquo;s licence. The scheme will operate for a period of 8 weeks and will be reviewed thereafter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading for question(s)  501","counter":1165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1166,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[20096\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":1167,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[20201\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will take action to ensure that a bank (details supplied) continues providing its graduate entry medicine student loan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":1168,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[20613\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a bank (details supplied) has decided to cancel its loans for graduate entry medicine students; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that this was the only source of funding for many students; if he has engaged with the bank on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1169,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 501, 505 and 520 together.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight, as Minister for Finance, I am precluded from intervening in commercial and operational decisions in any particular bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding.

However, with heat pump and electric vehicle adoption, this reduction is significantly abated to just a 0.2 per cent decline compared to the BaU scenario.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the work published by the ESRI finds that the combined policies contribute to a fall in economy-wide emissions of 21.6 per cent, when compared to\u00a0the BaU scenario.\u00a0 Specifically, the carbon tax is responsible for a 15.9 per cent reduction in emissions, or 8.3 million tonnes of CO2, when compared to\u00a0the BaU scenario. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the analysis undertaken by the ESRI, through the JRP, my Department has currently published updated estimates of the impact of inflation on energy prices over the medium term as part of the recently published Stability Programme Update 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1177,"content":"<p>Question No. 505 answered with Question No. 501.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1178,"content":"<p>Question No. 506 answered with Question No. 477.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Asset Management Agency","counter":1179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1180,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[20233\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the circumstances in which NAMA agreed to write of &pound;100 million debt owed by a company (details supplied); the reason NAMA was unable to recoup any funds from the sale by the company of the 146 apartments it was set up to develop; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1181,"content":"<p>By virtue of Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is legally precluded from disclosing confidential debtor information, including specific details relating to secured assets or confidential arrangements reached with debtors. <\/p>  <p>  While NAMA is legally constrained from providing detailed responses to the issues set out in the Deputy&rsquo;s query, NAMA advises that assertions contained in the query are misrepresentative of the factual situation.

This concluded that the introduction of such a model into the State would have impacts not only on insurance premiums, but also potentially on taxation and social security, as well as having constitutional, national and European ramifications, such as on EU insurance directives. It is therefore difficult to envisage a no-fault system as it exists in New Zealand being applied in Ireland in view of our current legal and constitutional framework. The Deputy should also note that introducing a no-fault model could have fundamental cost implications in terms of raising revenue in the form of direct and indirect taxation.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles, nor can I direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.<\/p>  <p>  In order to be as helpful as possible, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query. Insurance Ireland indicated it is not aware of any specific difficulties for private companies securing insurance cover for company owned electronic vehicles, nor has is received any queries through its Insurance Information Service in relation to this matter. <\/p>  <p>  Broadly, Insurance Ireland advised that its members do offer cover for these types of vehicles, whether company\u00a0 or individually owned and that in general the same standard acceptance criteria applies for electric vehicles as for fuel vehicles. However, Insurance Ireland noted that there can be differences between insurers, for example, whether such cover is only available through fleet insurance. I understand that this would be the same for all company cars, whether electrically or conventionally powered. <\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland highlights that different insurers can have different approaches to how this cover is offered for company owned vehicles and recommends that businesses should seek to get more than one quote. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), on its website, also recommends that consumers get quotes from a number of insurance companies, including their current one. I believe that this advice applies to businesses as well as individuals. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, work is continuing across Government to complete the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in order to improve the affordability and availability of cover for all groups, including motorists. Achievements to date include the creation of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market. The aims of the Office include working to further competition in the Irish market in order to increase the availability of cover, both by encouraging existing insurers to expand their risk appetite, and exploring opportunities for new entrants. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the Deputy to know that the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland is for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, and can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.

Health care is defined as the &ldquo;prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability&rdquo;. Expenses incurred in relation to the maintenance or treatment of an individual in a nursing home will qualify for income tax relief. This is subject to the requirement that the nursing home is one which provides 24-hour on-site care.<\/p>  <p>  Income tax relief available under section 469 TCA 1997 is due to the individual(s) who incur the relevant expense and is granted by way of a deduction, equal to the expense defrayed, from the individual&rsquo;s total income. The amount of income on which that individual is subject to income tax is therefore reduced and the relief is provided at his or her &lsquo;marginal rate&rsquo; of tax, being either 40% or 20%. <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual receives financial support under the Fair Deal Scheme, such amounts are not eligible for relief. Financial support includes both the payment made by the Health Service Executive (HSE) following an application for support to assist a person in meeting the cost of care services, and money advanced by the HSE by way of loan. Any excess contributions made by the individual towards nursing home fees will however qualify for income tax relief in the usual manner.<\/p>  <p>  Further details in relation to income tax relief for nursing home fees are set out on the Revenue website and in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-12, both of which may be found at the links below:<\/p>  <p>  - Revenue website: www.revenue.ie\/en\/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions\/health-and-age\/health-expenses\/index.aspx<\/p>  <p>  - Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-12.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Tax relief under section 469 TCA 1997 applies in respect of income tax only.\u00a0 Therefore, it does not extend to Universal Social Charge, Local Property Tax (LPT) or any other taxes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0proposals raised in the details supplied by the Deputy to create a fund from which fair deal expenses up to the taxpayers marginal rate of tax might be reimbursed in circumstances where income tax relief cannot be fully absorbed, would amount to a form of a refundable tax credit.\u00a0 Such proposals would raise broader policy and cost issues in respect of the\u00a0income tax system which are significantly beyond the question of tax relief for health expenses. <\/p>  <p>  Overall,\u00a0I am satisfied that income tax relief in respect of health expenses it in its current form is appropriately calibrated and there are no immediate plans to review or amend the relief.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, in relation to LPT it is worth pointing out that properties vacated by their owners due to illness can be exempt from the charge. This exemption applies to a property which was occupied by a person as his or her sole or main residence and has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity. An exemption may be available in situations where the property has been empty for less than 12 months, if a doctor is satisfied that the person is unlikely to return to the property. In both cases the LPT legislation currently stipulates that the exemption applies only where the property is not occupied by another person. However, the recently enacted Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021, modifies the above exemption so that from 2022 another person can occupy the property without the exemption being lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1197,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[20395\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if funding (details supplied) that has been allocated has been drawn down and spent; if there has been a follow up or appraisal on the funding given under the various programmes or headings; if any of the allocated funding has been recouped or unspent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department does not provide any funding to the organisation in question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Tax","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[20420\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a vehicle which was bought for commercial purposes in 2020 and was never deregistered due to Covid-19 could now be deregistered and reregistered as a 2022 vehicle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1202,"content":"<p>I understand from Revenue that the application process for the de-registration of a vehicle and repayment of the associated Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) continued to operate normally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>As explained on the Revenue website, if there are exceptional circumstances, then a vehicle may be de-registered and the VRT repaid provided that the following conditions are met:<\/p><p>- the circumstances arise within seven working days of the registration;<\/p><p>- the vehicle has not been licensed for use in a public place (i.e. road tax has not been paid); and<\/p><p>- an application for de-registration is made to Revenue within 21 days of the date of registration.<\/p><p>These statutory conditions help to maintain the integrity of the vehicle registration and VRT system, which gives assurance to purchasers that an unregistered vehicle is new.<\/p><p>In the particular case to which the Deputy refers, I recommend that the taxpayer should contact the National Vehicle Registration Tax Service (NVRTS) in Revenue to explain the details of their situation, which will allow Revenue to consider the case.\u00a0 The taxpayer can do this by using the MyEnquiries facility on the Revenue website.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Register","counter":1203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1204,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[20437\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600080#WRW05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether it is fair that a married couple who are separating and are restructuring their joint loans can have their individual credit ratings downgraded as a result of this considering they are not in arrears and that they are essentially just taking out new loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1205,"content":"<p>The Central Credit Register (CCR)\u00a0was established by the Central Bank of Ireland under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 (the Act).\u00a0 The purpose of the CCR is to ensure that credit providers will have access to the most accurate and up to-date information regarding a borrower&rsquo;s total debt exposure when considering an application for credit or when an existing loan is being restructured.

This is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan ambitions\u00a0to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. The annual breakdown of these receipts was provided in reply to PQ No.78 of 10 November 2021.\u00a0 Further details were provided to the Deputy in relation to this request in response to PQ No.172 of 18 November 2021 and PQ NO.68 of 24 November 2021 in relation to the methodology behind this calculation. <\/p>  <p>  As was previously noted, the projections for carbon tax receipts are based on a declining carbon tax base reflecting changing behaviour in response to the tax, amongst other factors. The projections were not based upon a 51 per cent reduction in emissions relative to 2018 levels. These estimates were based upon official projections from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published, in June 2021 which represented an independent assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions trajectory to 2030. Specifically the estimates are based on the EPA&rsquo;s non-ETS (EU Emissions Trading System) &lsquo;WAM&rsquo;, or with additional measures scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, which includes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a &euro;100 per tonne carbon tax by 2030. Currently, the EPA has not published an alternative emissions scenario that incorporates carbon tax changes in the manner that the Deputy has requested. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the impact on carbon tax receipts in a similar manner to previous calculations. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the rate of carbon tax, it is important to acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the carbon tax 2030 trajectory and to note that revenues raised from the additional ring-fenced carbon tax revenues will be used to fund Just Transition measures. <\/p>  <p>  For context, it should also be noted that changes to carbon tax rates are having a relatively small impact in terms of the rising energy costs being experienced by households and firms. Indeed, it is clear that the carbon tax is not the cause of current energy price inflation. Nonetheless, the Government recognises the difficulties such rising costs can create and has therefore taken a range of measures, such as the &euro;200 electricity credit and reductions in fuel excise duties, to support household incomes. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, over the medium to long term, the best way to protect the livelihood of citizens and our economic interests from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them. As set out in the CAP 2021, we will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600081#WRX02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":1230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600081#WRX02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1231,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[20705\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600081#WRX02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider the removal of VAT on period pants and on environmentally friendly period cups considering the fact that VAT has been removed for tampons and sanitary pads; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1232,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department are currently reviewing the options now available to Ireland in setting VAT rates.

An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis and so remains a priority aim of Government policy.

This paper details the specific allocation of carbon tax funds in line with the Programme for Government commitments and provides some detail on the programme areas that will receive additional funding. <\/p><p>In 2022, the carbon tax revenue available for investment is &euro;412m. This is comprised of the revenue made available in 2021 (&euro;148m) and 2020 (&euro;90m) and an additional &euro;174m in 2022.\u00a0<\/p><p>&euro;202 million of this additional carbon tax revenue has been allocated to residential and community energy efficiency in 2022. This funding has permitted the launch of a range of new and expanded supports for energy efficiency, including 80% grants for attic and cavity wall insulation and grant support of up to 50% for deep efficiency measures. More than half of these funds are also being used to provide free of charge energy efficiency upgrades to households in, or at risk of, energy poverty.\u00a0<\/p><p>A further &euro;174m of carbon tax revenues in 2022 are being spent on targeted social protection measures, such as increases in the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance, and the qualified child payment.\u00a0Analysis has demonstrated that this allocation to compensatory welfare measures means that the net impact of the carbon tax is progressive in 2022. Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset. Households in the bottom three deciles are better off as a result of the carbon increase and the compensatory welfare measures.\u00a0<\/p><p>The remaining revenues (&euro;36m) were allocated to fund the continuation of the 2020 and 2021 Carbon Tax Investment Programme.

My Department is also mindful of the need to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility built in to any revised approach so that higher education institutions can operate efficiently in making their staffing decisions, having regard to their overall expenditure allocations and other appropriate controls. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600084#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":1380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600084#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1381,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[20956\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600084#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the progress made by the OPW in developing the south Mayo relief scheme; the estimated cost of the scheme; when it is intended to proceed with the works outlined in the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":1382,"content":"<p>The Feasibility Report (September 2021) for these works was commissioned by Mayo County Council and funding for the report was approved under the OPW Minor Works Scheme, which is typically used for projects up to &euro;750,000 in value.

However, an underlying objective of the new system will be to ensure that\u00a0an adequate level of private rental accommodation can be provided, particularly in urban areas of high housing demand, and that such accommodation is not overly diverted to the short term letting sector at the expense of local people seeking long-term rental accommodation.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600085#WRBB05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":1474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600085#WRBB05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1475,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[19462\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600085#WRBB06000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the nature of approved housing body and rental accommodation scheme leases; the average cost of such leases; the length of such leases; the person or body that owns the properties at the end of the leases; and the number of such leases that are managed by the approved housing body the lease versus those in which the approved housing body will own at the end of the lease.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1476,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the leasing of houses and apartments.

AHBs can lease properties from private property owners using a long term lease arrangement for a period from 10 to 25 years.

Local authorities are required to evaluate that any social housing project, including those by AHBs, reflect housing need, that the properties comply with regulatory requirements and that the objectives of creating and maintaining sustainable communities are met.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, the main source of funding to AHBs for social housing delivery is through borrowings and support from local authorities through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and Payment and Availability (P&amp;A) programme.\u00a0AHBs enter into a P&amp;A agreement\u00a0with the local authority and make the relevant properties available for social housing. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Applications for P&amp;A-CALF funding are made by AHBs directly to my Department, following a consultation with the local authority. The application to my Department normally consists of a completed application form and a financial model for the capital cost, income and operational costs projected over the P&amp;A term.<\/p>  <p>  As with all Exchequer-supported projects, my Department as sanctioning authority assesses each project proposal for suitability as determined by the local authority, value for money and compliance with the various requirements of the funding programme. On the financial aspects of a CALF application, the Housing Agency undertakes an independent assessment to analyse the capital costs, projected income and projected expenditure against a standard set of assumptions agreed with the Department. The appropriate level of CALF is determined by reference to a projected minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR). Debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) is a measurement of the cash flow available to pay current debt obligations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Detailed approval, payment and performance monitoring arrangements are in place across all Departmental funding arrangements, including those supporting AHB activity. Following approval, letters of sanction include detailed terms and conditions relating to payments, and onward payments to AHBs are issued to the local authority and Approved Housing Body. In the case of CALF and P&amp;A supported projects, once approved, the local authority then enters into two agreements with the AHB, as follows:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - The P&amp;A Agreement that will cover the conditions under which the properties will be made available for the term of the agreement; and\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - A Capital Advance Agreement (CAA) that stipulates the terms and conditions on which the money is being made available from the State and also stipulates the repayment      conditions.<\/p>  <p>  All payments are made to AHBs by local authorities and my Department recoups these costs to local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Accelerated CALF payments may also be approved by the Department for projects including turnkey developments. The accelerated CALF can be applied to facilitate site purchases or stage payments to a developer, deposits for properties under construction or for sale and to facilitate the acquisition of homes requiring works. In such cases, the milestones may vary depending on the requirements of the project and will be set out by my Department in its approval letter. The local authority will seek an acknowledgement of the associated risk along with details on any mitigation measures to be taken by the AHB.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Social housing construction projects funded by my Department for local authorities under the Social Housing Investment Programme and for AHBs under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), must like all publicly-funded construction projects, comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability. To ensure alignment with the CWMF, these projects progress through a four stage approval process as part of the broader pre-construction process undertaken by the local authority.\u00a0 The four stages are:<\/p>  <p>  Stage 1 &ndash; Capital Appraisal submission to establish the business case;<\/p>  <p>  Stage 2 &ndash; Pre-planning submission and cost check;<\/p>  <p>  Stage 3 &ndash; Pre-tender approval and cost check;<\/p>  <p>  Stage 4 &ndash; Tender approval.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities also operate a single-stage approval process for construction projects up to &euro;6m in value, while Design and Build approaches are also used which can save time in relation to design, procurement and construction. The majority of local authority public housing projects are developed using public works contracts.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities also acquire social housing through a turnkey arrangement with developers through funding under the Social Housing Investment Programme. The Department&rsquo;s approval procedure for turnkeys is generally a single stage evaluation and approval with submissions being made by way of a Capital Appraisal. Unlike the public works contract for a CWMF construction project, a turnkey contract can be a simple &lsquo;Contract of Sale&rsquo;. However, there are general procurement principles which apply and, in particular, the local authorities must comply with obligations for transparency and equal treatment, as well as clarifying for my Department&lsquo;s assessment and approval, that the turnkey proposal meets housing need, is suitable in terms of typology and sustainable community principles, is compliant with regulatory requirements and represents value for money.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently published a new Design Manual for Quality Housing and also a Review of Pre-Construction Processes undertaken in cooperation with the local authority and AHB sectors. These recent initiatives are important in the work to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness and pace of delivery of social homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600086#WRCC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1488,"content":"<p>Question No. 614 answered with Question No. 613.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Schemes","counter":1489,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600086#WRCC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1490,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[19473\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600086#WRCC01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of social housing retrofits by local authority per year from 2016 to 2021; the average cost of the retrofit per home in each county for each year in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1491,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[20869\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600086#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of local authority homes that received an energy retrofit in 2021 by local authority; the average cost per unit in each local authority for the retrofit; and the average contribution from his Department per unit in each local authority for the retrofit in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1492,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 615 and 684 together.<\/p><p>My Department launched the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme (EERP) in 2013 with the aim of funding the retrofit of social homes requiring insulation and energy upgrade works.

Submissions made during the public consultation period will be reviewed and where appropriate and necessary, amendments will be made to the published Draft. Thereafter, the draft guidelines will be submitted to the Minister for approval. The final Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  <\/p>  <p>  The Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS), was jointly launched by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government in 2013.

The manual is mandatory for urban roads and streets within the 60 km\/h urban speed limit zone (with some limited exceptions). The proposed Sustainable &amp;amp; Compact Settlement Guidelines, will be concerned with the delivery of compact and sustainable forms of urban development more generally.  However, due to the interrelated nature of the guidance the DMURS guidance will be reflected in the updated Sustainable &amp;amp; Compact Settlement Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600086#WRCC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":1526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600086#WRCC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1527,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[19642\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600086#WRCC03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he intends introducing a means-tested housing repair grant similar to the housing aid for older people scheme for persons living in private houses who are under 65 years of age to assist in refurbishing substandard housing or building an extension in cases in which the house is overcrowded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1528,"content":"<p>My Department provides Exchequer funding to local authorities to support the Housing Adaptation Grant for Older People and\u00a0People with a Disability schemes.

There is a commitment to enhance family support and prevention and early intervention services for children and their families through a multi-agency and coordinated response, and\u00a0the dissemination of innovative practice.\u00a0There is also a commitment to identify and provide enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to families experiencing long-term homelessness to help them exit from homelessness and maintain their homes.\u00a0These actions are being delivered with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Cooperation through joined-up policy and action are key to addressing all forms of homelessness.\u00a0 A key initiative that I have put in place is the National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC), which I chair and which meets on a quarterly basis. NHAC is a cross-governmental and inter-agency oversight group with membership drawn from key Departments, State agencies and bodies involved in addressing homelessness. The overarching objective of NHAC is to drive delivery of homeless actions, including those under the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All plan. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at the local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, with additional supports, including the provision of family\u00a0supports,\u00a0provided to families by Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as such, applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. Lone parents are entitled to access all of the housing support delivery mechanisms on an equal basis with all other citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The increases in family homelessness seen in recent months are a serious concern for my Department and for the Government.\u00a0We are acting to address this &ndash; in the short term and strategically over the months and years ahead.\u00a0Over 5,200 adults and their dependant children exited homelessness\u00a0in 2021.\u00a0All of these exits were to homes with tenancies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to prioritise responses\u00a0for all families, including lone parents, experiencing homelessness and this is being reflected in both strategic policy and in specific actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600089#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":1731,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600090#WRHH00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1730,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600090#WRHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1731,"qnumday":700,"qnumall":"[19203\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600090#WRHH00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will review a passport application by a person (details supplied);

These sanctions are only effective in so far as they are properly implemented. Ireland, along with EU partners, is working to ensure that EU sanctions are fully implemented and enforced, including through full and effective application of the asset freezes and prohibitions on making funds available to those individuals and entities included on the Ukraine-related sanctions list.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Financial institutions report funds frozen under EU sanctions to the Central Bank of Ireland, and details are in turn notified to the European Commission. The total value of funds frozen to 22 April is approximately EUR 1.2 billion. It is expected that more notifications will be received as financial institutions complete due diligence procedures, and to reflect ongoing additions to the sanctions list. Given its confidential nature, the Department is not in a position to provide more detailed information on the frozen funds.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The three national competent authorities for sanctions in Ireland are the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Central Bank of Ireland. The competent authorities are empowered to issue authorisations to derogate from EU sanctions regimes, where this is provided for in the relevant EU legal acts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  EU sanctions regimes normally include provisions to allow listed individuals and entities to apply for derogations to sanctions in very specific circumstances, such as to satisfy basic needs such as payments for food, rent or medical treatment, or to pay legal fees or bank fees.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the Department of Foreign Affairs has received an application from one entity for an authorisation under Council Regulation (EU) No 269\/2014 of 17 March 2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, as amended. The Department is not in a position to provide any further details on this authorisation request. The Department understands that the other competent authorities have also received applications for authorisations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  EU sanctions require that the assets of listed individuals and entities be frozen, so that the sanctioned individual or entity cannot benefit from them economically. This is a fundamental principle of sanctions, which are temporary measures that aim to incentivise changes in behaviour or policy and which are not intended to be punitive. However, some Member States have proposed that assets frozen in the context of the situation in Ukraine could be seized, and used for purposes including the rebuilding of Ukraine. I have expressed openness to this proposal. However, it requires extensive further discussion in order to ensure a robust and clear legal basis, as it would be a departure from current practice.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In March 2022, the European Commission created the &lsquo;Freeze and Seize&rsquo; Task Force, to ensure coordination among Member States on the implementation of sanctions related to Ukraine. A particular focus of the Task Force is the identification and freezing of assets belonging to Russian and Belarussian oligarchs in the EU. The Task Force is also considering the interplay between sanctions and criminal law measures, with a view to possibly seizing the assets of those included in the sanctions list where their activities may also breach criminal law. As Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Task Force is led by the Department of Justice, that Department would be better placed to provide more information on its work.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1904,"content":"<p>Question No. 764 answered with Question No. 763.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1905,"content":"<p>Question No. 765 answered with Question No. 763.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1906,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1907,"qnumday":766,"qnumall":"[20481\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason for the delay in processing a passport application by a person (details supplied) that was received in August 2021; the correct process for this application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1589","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1908,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service regrets the delay with this application and has contacted the applicant's parents directly in relation to the application.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1910,"qnumday":767,"qnumall":"[20511\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied) will be reviewed; the steps that his Department is taking to alleviate the pressures being felt on the ground regarding this system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1911,"content":"<p>The Passport Service is proactively managing the current demand for passports and has put in place resources and structures to address the estimated significant increase in demand for passports in 2022 in this essential citizen service.<\/p><p>The vast majority of online applications are processed within the turnaround times outlined below.\u00a0 <table>    <tr>       <th>Online application type<\/th>       <th>Current average turnaround time<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Simple renewals<\/td>       <td>10 Working Days<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Complex renewals<\/td>       <td>15 Working Days<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>First time applicants<\/td>       <td>30 Working Days<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>In addition, 45% of adult renewal online applications are issued within one working day of receipt.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Last week, the Passport Service reduced the average turnaround time for first time applications from 35 working days to 30 working days. This followed an initial reduction in processing time from 40 working days to 35 working days which was made last month, and is a direct result of the staffing and resources the Department has invested in the Passport Service.\u00a0<\/p><p>There are currently over 167,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.<\/p><p>Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. <\/p><p>In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. <\/p><p>In cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct. Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required, adding to the processing time.<\/p><p>Of the total number of applications currently in the Passport Service system, 42,600 are first time child applications. 15,000 (35%) of these first time child applications are incomplete. This means that the applicant has either not sent any documentation after they applied online or additional documentation has been requested by the Passport Service.\u00a0The Passport Service cannot process applications that are not complete.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services:<\/p><p>- The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.<\/p><p>- A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021. <\/p><p>- The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.\u00a0<\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.<\/p><p>- In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. <\/p><p>- A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants. <\/p><p>- A new Passport Service site in Swords, Co. Dublin opened in November 2021 and accommodates 140 staff. Works on expansion of the Passport Service site in Balbriggan began in January 2022 and it is anticipated that this will be completed in the autumn of 2022.  This will accommodate 175 staff.<\/p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year. <\/p><p>- There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.\u00a0<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1912,"content":"<p>Question No. 768 answered with Question No. 702.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":1913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1914,"qnumday":769,"qnumall":"[20572\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600093#WRNN04700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position in relation to an application by a person (details supplied) which was submitted on 26 August 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1915,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for citizenship by descent through the Foreign Births Register under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  The processing of Foreign Birth Registration (FBR) has resumed and will be gradually scaling up in line with the recruitment of additional resources.

The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s aims were to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they could move on to their planned educational placement for the start of the next school year along with their peers.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time ever, all schools (primary and-post primary) were encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria was extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion, summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools.   Overall, 37,977 pupils participated in the 2021 summer programme across both home and school-based elements, which represented an increase of 65% on participation in the 2020 programme.<\/p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s programme is building upon 2021&rsquo;s increased participation figures and in this regard, there will be extensive engagement with stakeholders and promotional material published to promote this year&rsquo;s programme. <\/p>  <p>  Summer programmes in post primary schools were provided for the first time in 2020, the number of schools who participated increased by over 37% in 2021 and it is hoped building upon last year&rsquo;s success and with increased awareness of the new programme, will see a further increase in the number of schools who are prepared to offer such programmes this year. <\/p>  <p>  A key objective of this year is to support schools   in offering the summer programme to their students.

Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department&rsquo;s projections of school place requirements.

A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil permanent school building for the school is underway. The\u00a0building project for Carrigtwohill campus will accommodate two primary schools and a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school building for Carrigtwohill Community College and is being delivered under the Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme.\u00a0This delivery programme uses a professional external Project Management team to progress the project through the stages of architectural planning, tendering and construction.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Letter of Intent (LOI) issued on\u00a0the 15th of February 2022\u00a0to the preferred tenderer. \u00a0This allows the preferred bidder to put in place the Bond, Insurances and confirmations of all legal arrangements required under the Contract.\u00a0\u00a0Following receipt of all the necessary documentation, the Department will be in a position to issue the Letter of Acceptance (LOA), which will allow the contractor to mobilise on site.\u00a0My Department will advise the Board of Management when the Letter of Acceptance\u00a0issues.<\/p>  <p>  Once the successful contractor is appointed, the Department&rsquo;s project manager will liaise with the contractor to ensure that the Community College is prioritised and delivered as early as possible within the Contractor&rsquo;s Programme of Works for the campus.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, additional accommodation has been approved for Carrigtwohill Community College for September 2022 which includes 6 general classrooms, a home-economics room, SEN Class and ancillary accommodation. This accommodation is being delivered by Cork ETB.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s school building programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. <\/p>  <p>  An extension\u00a0at St. Colman's Community College, Midleton has recently been completed to cater for up to 1,000 pupils. A number of other\u00a0large scale school building projects are also in train to cater for similar pupil numbers. This includes expanded capacity at Christian Brothers Secondary School and St. Mary's High School in Midleton.

My Department is fully committed to ensuring that wellbeing is at the core of the ethos of all schools in Ireland, and that this is done through the implementation of the Wellbeing Policy Statement. The approach proposed in the Wellbeing Policy Statement is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:<\/p><p>- build core social and\u00a0emotional skills and competencies<\/p><p>- experience supportive\u00a0relationships within the school setting<\/p><p>- be part of a school\u00a0environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically\u00a0safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness,\u00a0that their voice is heard, and they feel supported<\/p><p>Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. <\/p><p>Since the wellbeing policy was published, work has taken place to realise the vision set out in the Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy by the Department&rsquo;s support services and agencies.\u00a0 Following an action research project involving thirty schools, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) has developed Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to support schools as they engage in a wellbeing promotion process. This national rollout of CPD commenced in March 2022 and is available to all schools. <\/p><p>This CPD will be supplemented with a parallel resource for schools developed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), offering a series of webinars on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools, including on trauma-informed approaches.The approaches outlined in the webinars are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. \u00a0<\/p><p>NEPS provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist. <\/p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children\/young people with social\/emotional\/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include the FRIENDS<b><\/b>programmes. These are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence.<\/p><p>A dedicated wellbeing portal has been developed and is now available, bringing together all the wellbeing supports and resources that have been developed by the Department and the Department&rsquo;s support service together and these are available on the gov.ie website.<\/p><p>Active School Flag (ASF) is a Department of Education and Skills initiative supported by Healthy Ireland, and part of the National Physical Activity Plan.<\/p><p>My Department funds the Active School Flag (ASF) and this initiative is also supported by Healthy Ireland.

It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600098#WRSS06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions","counter":2259,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600098#WRSS06600"},{"type":"question","counter":2260,"qnumday":894,"qnumall":"[20117\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600098#WRSS06700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount to be paid by each religious institution into the residential institutional redress board scheme, in tabular form; and the amount that has been paid to date by each of the religious institutions.","asker":"1468","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2261,"content":"<p>The 18 religious congregations involved in the management of most of the residential institutions in which child abuse took place have made contributions towards the costs incurred by the State in responding to that abuse under two rounds: the legally binding 2002 Indemnity Agreement and the voluntary offers made in 2009 in the aftermath of the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the &ldquo;Ryan Report&rdquo;).

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022\/23.\u00a0 This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. <\/p><p>The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.\u00a0 Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.<\/p><p>The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.\u00a0 In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer\/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.<\/p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile.

A ballot was undertaken and the result was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.\u00a0 I am very pleased to hear of this overwhelmingly positive result on what has been a long running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for these staff under grant schemes, and that where a school employs a staff member to\u00a0support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for\u00a0terms of employment rests with the school.\u00a0 On that basis, there has been extensive engagement between my Department and school management bodies to work towards a resolution. I would also like to acknowledge the willingness of F&oacute;rsa and in particular the school secretary representatives for their constructive engagement in this process, and to recognise the support of Minister McGrath and his officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at all stages of the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,\u00a0 moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.\u00a0 Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The final element of the package will introduce standardised arrangements in respect of annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.<\/p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement will include a complex process of assimilating each individual secretary to the new terms and conditions which will vary depending on individual circumstances. The Department will expedite this process and will communicate further as the work progresses.<\/p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff.

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022\/23.\u00a0 This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. <\/p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.\u00a0 Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.\u00a0 In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need.

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs. \u00a0Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.\u00a0 SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Where\u00a0circumstances change during the course of the 2021\/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that\u00a0the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the\u00a0existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. \u00a0Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published\u00a0on the NCSE website\u00a0ncse.ie\/for-schools  <\/p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching (SET) allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools based on a diagnosis of disability.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model. The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>A process\u00a0is available where schools can\u00a0seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.\u00a0\u00a0Detailed information on the NCSE review process is published\u00a0on the NCSE website\u00a0ncse.ie\/for-schools  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the school as outlined in the details supplied and in regards to their SET allocation,\u00a0the\u00a0re-profiling for the 2022\/2023 school year has been completed and the school has been advised in writing by the NCSE of a significant increase in their SET allocation from the start\u00a0of the next school year (September 2022),\u00a0details of the new allocation is also available on the NCSE website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":2395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06200"},{"type":"question","counter":2396,"qnumday":940,"qnumall":"[20835\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when construction will commence on a new school (details supplied) in Roscrea.","asker":"1610","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2397,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved for delivery to Tipperary Education and\u00a0Training Board (TETB). <\/p><p>The ETB\u00a0is currently in the process of procuring\u00a0a Design Team for this project and the Department understands that this process is nearing completion.<\/p><p>The Design Team will ensure that the project progresses through the design stages, obtains the necessary statutory planning permission, and moves onward to tender and construction in due course.<\/p><p>It is not possible to provide a timeline for completion of the project at this early stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":2398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06500"},{"type":"question","counter":2399,"qnumday":941,"qnumall":"[20840\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of Ukrainian students who have enrolled in schools in Ireland, by county, from 1 January 2022 to 15 April 2022 in totals of both primary and secondary schools, by county, in tabular form.","asker":"1610","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":2400,"qnumday":942,"qnumall":"[20841\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of Ukrainian students who have enrolled in each primary and secondary school in County Tipperary from 1 January 2022 to 15 April 2022, in tabular form, by primary school and secondary school.","asker":"1610","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":2401,"qnumday":943,"qnumall":"[20844\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600100#WRUU06800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of Ukrainian students who have enrolled in fee-paying schools in Ireland from 1 January 2022 to 15 April 2022, in tabular form, by county and within each county, the details of each school and in which a school has not taken any.","asker":"1610","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2402,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 941 to 943, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 3,800 students from Ukraine have enrolled in schools to date.

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school.\u00a0 Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. My Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA)\u00a0to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus\u00a0of the work of the NCCA has been\u00a0on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE\/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way. This work is progressing well and sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE JC Short Course and SC SPHE Framework) have now\u00a0been published.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA online SPHE toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address issues of consent, gender and sexual discrimination and violence, and related topics within the SPHE classroom. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum is progressing. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.\u00a0\u00a0A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council by the summer, with a public consultation to follow when schools return in September. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in schools from September 2023.\u00a0The Senior Cycle updated syllabus will be rolled out in schools in September 2024 followed by the update at Primary level.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this,\u00a0I have recently announced my Department's intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE\/RSE.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This programme will provide a pathway for progression for post-primary teachers interested in developing their skills in teaching SPHE\/RSE and in so doing build capacity and leadership within the teaching profession in relation to the teaching of SPHE\/RSE.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The intention to provide teachers with access to a new postgraduate course to be developed for teachers in post-primary schools teaching SPHE\/RSE.

The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the students in their school and care and safety should be at the centre of all policy and practices. Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions and to provide training for teachers to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school. \u00a0Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. <\/p>  <p>  The availability and provision of health-related supports, including therapy services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, and matters in relation to the provision of health-related services should be directed to that body or to the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  Nursing support for children with complex needs in school is provided directly by the HSE or through a HSE funded provider.

Psychologists work within a regional and local office structure serving the needs of schools in their immediate vicinity. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require further support are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.<\/p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children\/young people with social\/emotional\/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include the FRIENDS<b><\/b>programmes. These are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence.<\/p><p>NEPS have developed a series of webinars on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools, including on trauma-informed approaches. The approaches outlined in the webinars are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600101#WRVV05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Council for Special Education","counter":2460,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600101#WRVV05700"},{"type":"question","counter":2461,"qnumday":962,"qnumall":"[21206\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600101#WRVV05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 105 of 6 April 2022, if she will request the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to provide a response given that none has issued to date.","asker":"1628","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2462,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that officials from my Department will follow up with the NCSE to request that\u00a0a response issues as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600101#WRVV05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"St&aacute;das Scoile","counter":2463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600101#WRVV06000"},{"type":"question","counter":2464,"qnumday":963,"qnumall":"[21214\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600101#WRVV06100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"i bhfoirm t&aacute;bla ainmneacha na scoileanna iar-bhunoideachais ar fud na t&iacute;r a bhfuil st&aacute;das &ldquo;Scoil Bheag&rdquo; acu agus an lion scol&aacute;ir&iacute; i ngach scoil acu; an bun&uacute;s faoin ar bronnadh an stadas sin orthu; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1575","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2465,"content":"<p>Foils&iacute;tear na criteir a &uacute;saidtear chun m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; a leithdh&aacute;ileadh ar scoileanna go bliant&uacute;il ar shu&iacute;omh Gr&eacute;as&aacute;in mo Roinne (is &eacute; 0024\/2022 an ciorclan abhartha)<\/p><p>Cuireann mo Roinn buis&eacute;id p&aacute; agus neamhph&aacute; ar f&aacute;il do gach Bord Oideachais agus Oili&uacute;na (BOO) chun tac&uacute; lena scoileanna BOO aonair, col&aacute;ist&iacute;, ceannoifig agus ionaid oideachais eile.

This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. <\/p>  <p>  While the caring requirements of carees may be different, this does not affect the rates of the allowance, which is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.    <\/p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash and capital.  It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure.

needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).\u00a0<\/p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance\u00a0provides immediate\u00a0assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.\u00a0<\/p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.\u00a0 The scheme

scheme,\u00a0a\u00a0supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.\u00a0 In addition,\u00a0officers can make a single exceptional needs payment\u00a0(ENP)\u00a0to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.\u00a0 Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.<\/p><p>Statistics are maintained\u00a0on\u00a0the number of applications awarded\u00a0under the SWA scheme.\u00a0 Statistics are not maintained on the number of

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key conditions of Core Funding will be the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability effects of the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme. Core Funding will also include conditions in relation to quality improvements in services and transparency in relation to operations.<\/p>  <p>  Extensive information has been communicated to the sector, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services.\u00a0A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery. Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out.<\/p>  <p>  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same. An estimated 1% of services will be caught by the funding guarantee. All other services will see increases in funding, and most substantial increases in funding.\u00a0 Those services that are affected by the funding guarantee are those that are in receipt of the highest levels of public funding - between &euro;110 and &euro;120 per hour of provision with two staff required to be employed.<\/p>  <p>  City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at\u00a0myccc.ie\/where-is-my-nearest-ccc\u00a0and providers\u00a0can reach out for support at any time.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This sees the funding for the employment of graduates more fairly distributed across the ELC system.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher.

They are also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45\u00a0hours per week.<\/p><p>- Income Assessed Subsidies\u00a0are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on your individual circumstances. Your rate will vary depending on your level of family income, your child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in your family.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 announced a number of changes to the NCS which will be rolled out this year. The first change will\u00a0remove the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. The second change will extend the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefiting up to 40,000 children. Full year estimates of these changes have been factored into the costs below but the impact of these changes will not be fully known until Q.4 2022.<\/p><p>The estimated costs based on the scenarios presented are derived from current levels of usage and expenditure and informed by SWITCH, the ESRI tax-benefit model. These individual estimates are based on no behavioural change and should be interpreted with caution. It should be noted that changes to subsidies may result in changes to patterns and levels of usage by families. These changes are likely to be more pronounced at higher rates of increase. <\/p><p>In addition, although the question refers to children under 3 years old, as noted above from September 2022 universal will available for children under 15 and the costs have been assessed on an under-15 basis<\/p><p>Based on the above, the follow\u00a0estimated costs have been extrapolated and rounded:<\/p><p>Cost of increasing the\u00a0universal subsidy for children  by each of the amounts:<\/p><p>- 50 cent\u00a0 - &euro;50 million<\/p><p>- &euro;1 - &euro;105 million<\/p><p>- &euro;2\u00a0- &euro;210 million<\/p><p>- &euro;5 - &euro;480 million<\/p><p>Cost of increasing each of the NCS rates by: <\/p><p>- &euro;1 - &euro;145 million<\/p><p>- &euro;2 - &euro;290 million<\/p><p>- &euro;5\u00a0- &euro;730 million<\/p><p>- &euro;10\u00a0- &euro;1.45 billion<\/p><p>Cost and the estimated number of families who would benefit from\u00a0increasing the maximum reckonable family income of &euro;60,000 under the national childcare scheme by: <\/p><p>- &euro;2,500 - &euro;6 million benefiting approximately 4,500 children<\/p><p>- &euro;5,000\u00a0- &euro;12 million benefiting approximately 5,200 children<\/p><p>- &euro;10,000 - &euro;24 million benefiting approximately 12,500 children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600107#WRBBB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2856,"content":"<p>Question No. 1098 answered with Question No. 1097.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2857,"content":"<p>Question No. 1099 answered with Question No. 1097.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":2858,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600107#WRBBB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2859,"qnumday":1100,"qnumall":"[19331\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600107#WRBBB04000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will re-examine the issue of core funding for providers; if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2860,"content":"<p>In December 2021, Government adopted the 25 recommendations contained in an Expert Group report,\u00a0Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC).<\/p>  <p>  The new funding model will support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key conditions of Core Funding will be the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability effects of the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme. Core Funding will also include conditions in relation to quality improvements in services and transparency in relation to operations.<\/p>  <p>  Extensive information has been communicated to the sector, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services. A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery. Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out.\u00a0 Indeed in the correspondence referred to, the service in question will see a substantial percentage increase in income by the provider's own calculations.<\/p>  <p>  City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at\u00a0myccc.ie\/where-is-my-nearest-ccc\u00a0and providers\u00a0can reach out for support at any time.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This sees public funding for the employment of graduates in ELC more fairly distributed across the system .<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed in this way based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding. In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2021, I also launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028.\u00a0Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nurturing Skills commits to the provision of\u00a0part-funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for Early Years Educators working in the sector. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed.\u00a0This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave.<\/p>  <p>  In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including many of those highlighted in the correspondence detailed,\u00a0such as\u00a0the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, additional information relating to Core Funding is now available at\u00a0first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/core-funding. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600107#WRBBB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":2880,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600107#WRBBB06100"},{"type":"question","counter":2881,"qnumday":1107,"qnumall":"[19514\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600107#WRBBB06200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of children in one-parent families who availed of the national childcare scheme universal subsidy in each year between 2020 and 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2882,"content":"<p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) provides financial support to help parents meet the cost of childcare and to support better outcomes for children.<\/p><p>There are two types of supports available under the Scheme:<\/p><p>- The\u00a0Universal Subsidy\u00a0is available to all families with children under 3 years.

Individual departments and agencies continue to hold primary responsibility for their own statutory schemes and funded programmes in this context.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group is comprised of representatives of relevant departments, agencies and stakeholders, including members of the Disability Stakeholders Group, experts by experience, and Disabled Persons Organisations.\u00a0At its January meeting the Group agreed to conduct a \"stock taking\" exercise to assess the current state of transport supports. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the operation of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme is the responsibility of the Minister of Finance, who established that Scheme by Statutory Instrument under the provisions of the Finance Acts. These regulations include the criteria for primary medical certificates, and any alteration to same would ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Finance to pursue via Statutory Instrument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":2899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2900,"qnumday":1113,"qnumall":"[19623\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC00900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of persons employed by his Department and bodies under the aegis of his Department with a rate of pay below the living wage of &euro;12.30; the role that those persons occupy within his Department or relevant body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2901,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, any adjustments to the salaries of civil and public servants are set out in BUILDING MOMENTUM - A new public service agreement, 2021-2022.<\/p><p>A suggested living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour would equate to an annual salary of &euro;23,747, based on a standard civil service net working week of 37 hours.

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision. <\/p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers. <\/p><p>Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.<\/p><p>One of the key conditions of Core Funding will be the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability effects of the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme. Core Funding will also include conditions in relation to quality improvements in services and transparency in relation to operations.<\/p><p>Extensive information has been communicated to the sector, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services.\u00a0A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery. Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out. <\/p><p>City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at www.myccc.ie\/where-is-my-nearest-ccc\u00a0and providers\u00a0can reach out for support at any time.\u00a0<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This distributes public funding in respect of graduate staff more fairly across ELC provision.<\/p><p>Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed in this way based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding. In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme.<\/p><p>In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including many of those highlighted in the correspondence detailed,\u00a0such as\u00a0the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, detailed information relating to Core Funding is now available at www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/core-funding. \u00a0<\/p><p>The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.<\/p><p>I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seekers","counter":2905,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2906,"qnumday":1115,"qnumall":"[19661\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC01500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the reason the Reception and Integration Agency ceased publishing detailed monthly reports regarding direct provision and asylum in Ireland which were routinely published from 2004 to 2018; if there are plans to make such detailed information reports available at any point in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2907,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) was replaced by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) in 2019.\u00a0 This change of structures and the demands of the Covid pandemic created delays in the publication of information.\u00a0 However, information that would previously have been contained in RIA&rsquo;s annual reports is now made available by IPAS on the Gov.ie website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":2908,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2909,"qnumday":1116,"qnumall":"[19696\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600108#WRCCC01800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"when he plans to make medical cards available to all survivors of mother and baby homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2910,"content":"<p>I am acutely aware of the sense of urgency surrounding the establishment of\u00a0the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme.

Examples include a break-down in placements; lack of suitable placements; complexity of the young person&rsquo;s needs, including psychological or mental health issues; criminality; substance abuse or concerns for their safety. As the operating environment for such placements is dynamic, and numbers fluctuate on a daily basis, on average between 9-11 young people are referred for such emergency placements per month. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla further stated that such placements are considered short-term, transitional and exceptional. By way of example, in 2021, Tusla received 72,762 referrals. At the end of January 2022 there were 5,850 children in care.  Of the children in care, 90% are in Foster Care, 8% are in residential care and the remaining 2% are in &ldquo;other&rdquo; care placements, including supported lodgings, at home under a care order, other residential centres (e.g., disability) or a detention centre. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla further advised that it is currently developing an Alternative Care Strategic Plan to ensure that it continues to improve services for children, young people and their families. The Alternative Care Strategy incorporates a specific plan for Residential Care Services, Foster Care and Aftercare. <\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Residential Care Strategic Plan 2022-25 was approved by the Tusla Board on 25th March.

of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the plans that are in place to increase the fostering allowance for foster parents in line with escalating costs particularly for the over ten-year-olds.","asker":"1499","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2990,"content":"<p>The Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, stipulates that the allowance payable to foster carers and relatives shall not be less than an amount specified by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance was last increased on January 1st 2009. Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.\u00a0 Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.\u00a0 Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.\u00a0\u00a0 Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.\u00a0The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.\u00a0 A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter, which will then be considered by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation foster care will form part of this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":2991,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2992,"qnumday":1145,"qnumall":"[20633\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his Department can reimburse a service provider (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2993,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that a payment has issued to the service provider on foot of an invoice and related supporting documents received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":2994,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2995,"qnumday":1146,"qnumall":"[20636\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of staff within his Department who availed of a secondment from January 2019 to date on the basis that it was not the intention of the staff member to return to his or her position within the Department.","asker":"1466","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2996,"content":"<p>My Department operates the guidelines in relation to secondments which are set out by DPER and approved by the Civil Service Management Board and can be found at hr.per.gov.ie\/en\/corporate-pages\/career\/mobility\/secondment\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":2997,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":2998,"qnumday":1147,"qnumall":"[20684\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the details of all youth services in Dublin 1, 3, 7, 9 and 11 under the remit of his Department, including the name, location, amount of funding and number of young people engaged in each programme, in tabular form.","asker":"1568","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2999,"content":"<p>My Department provides a range of youth funding nationally through the\u00a0Education and Training Boards (ETBs), acting as a funding intermediary for my Department.

The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.\u00a0 Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.\u00a0 Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager. Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.\u00a0The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.\u00a0 A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter, which will then be considered by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate.

Government priority.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, significant increases in State investment in early learning and childcare has given rise to a substantial growth in the numbers of children participating in these services. More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain\u00a0areas, and in certain\u00a0age groups.<\/p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%. <\/p>  <p>  As part of ongoing efforts by my Department to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, Pobal, using the data captured as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected national vacancy rates in February 2022. These projections revealed an estimated fall in national vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates projected to have fallen from 21% to 19%. <\/p>  <p>  Pobal has commenced the new data collection as of 4 April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity\u00a0and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.<\/p>  <p>  Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on\u00a0www.myccc.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600110#WREEE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":3049,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600110#WREEE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3050,"qnumday":1164,"qnumall":"[21229\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600110#WREEE01800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if a piece of surveillance technology (details supplied) is being used by his Department or any agencies under his remit in view of the fact that there are security and privacy concerns associated with the use of same; the data protection policies on the use of artificial intelligence with respect to instances in which this technology is being used; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":3051,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department operates from 2 offices:<\/p><p>1.

Whilst presently, the RPL and RPQ systems are working as designed SOLAS will increase its monitoring of applications and any issues arising. In this approach, SOLAS is operating in line with QQI guidance.<\/p>  <p>  Where a profession is unregulated, there is no formal barrier to prevent someone from continuing to practice their profession in Ireland. However, where a profession is regulated, an individual wishing to continue to practice their profession in Ireland must engage with the relevant Irish competent authority or professional regulator in order to seek the recognition of their qualifications. I would urge any Ukrainian citizen who wishes to practice a regulated profession in Ireland, to engage with the relevant Competent Authority with responsibility for that profession to seek the recognition of their professional qualifications. A list of all of the regulated professions in Ireland, their corresponding competent authority and the relevant contact information for each authority is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/pdf\/?file=https:\/\/assets.gov.ie\/123679\/f3dc868b-f95a-42fe-87b3-531983e3bd1f.pdf#page=null.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been providing support to the work of our national Competent Authorities by sharing best practice material supplied by the European Commission in relation to the recognition of Ukrainian professional qualifications. In addition, these Competent Authorities have been advised of further information resources which are available to support their work from NARIC Ireland. My Department will continue its work with the European Commission and other Member States in relation to the recognition of professional qualifications of Ukrainian people to ensure an EU-wide appropriate response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600110#WREEE05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":3089,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600110#WREEE05700"},{"type":"question","counter":3090,"qnumday":1177,"qnumall":"[19713\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600110#WREEE05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for reviewing fees at third level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":3091,"content":"<p>I am commited to the progressive implementation of measures to address costs as a barrier to education, within the overall context of Government policy towards costs of living and other relevant strategies including those related to access and participation in education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0is important\u00a0to highlight the very substantial financial support, currently\u00a0well in excess of half a billion euros, provided by the taxpayer towards\u00a0tuition fees\u00a0and the student contribution for students in higher education.<\/p>  <p>  This comprises State funding of tuition\u00a0costs\u00a0amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 156,000 eligible higher education students.\u00a0 It also includes\u00a0&euro;190m paid by the Exchequer\u00a0under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits\u00a0over 65,000 eligible students.<\/p>  <p>  The level of financial support\u00a0highlights the\u00a0Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting\u00a0the costs of higher education\u00a0and to obtaining higher education\u00a0qualifications which the evidence demonstrates will assist them in securing more sustainable\u00a0and higher\u00a0paid employment than\u00a0those in the labour force who do not benefit from such\u00a0qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that students, like so many others in society, face as a result of the increased costs of living.\u00a0 For students and their families this includes not just costs such as accommodation and food but also education-specific costs such as tuition fees and the student contribution.\u00a0The Government as a whole is committed to addressing issues related to the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  I have already taken significant steps to support learners and their families.\u00a0 Effective from the start of the next academic year the rate of grant will be increased by &euro;200 for all SUSI recipients, I have widened the thresholds to allow more people to apply for student grants and I have changed the distance thresholds to reflect the increased costs for those who live further away from their colleges.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have also put significant additional resources into the Student Assistance Fund, including an additional &euro;1.3 million recently announced, which brings the fund to &euro;18.5m for the current academic year.<\/p>  <p>  However, the SUSI scheme clearly does not cover everybody, and there are many families who must pay out significant amounts of money each year to continue in third level education.<\/p>  <p>  There are different options to address the costs of education, including adjusting the student contribution or increasing SUSI thresholds, but fundamentally these are decisions which must be made in the context of the annual Estimates process.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The student contribution costs as shared between the students and the state is a significant element of the overall income of our higher education institutions.

In academic year 20\/21 the state contribution was &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.<\/p>  <p>  Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600111#WRFFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":3121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600111#WRFFF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3122,"qnumday":1188,"qnumall":"[20126\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600111#WRFFF01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the budget line under which mental health supports in higher education are currently drawn; if recent increases will be put on a more permanent footing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":3123,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department allocates mental health and well-being\u00a0funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA)\u00a0for direct disbursement to the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of their student services, the employment of counselling staff, and the procurement of counselling and mental health services are a matter for the individual institutions.<\/p><p>In 2021, &euro;5 million was allocated to the higher education institutions to support student mental health and wellbeing. This funding allocated by the HEA included &euro;2m delivered through the Recurrent Grant Model to HEIs, along with an additional &euro;3m secured as part of the 2021 Covid-19 response package.<\/p><p>HEIs were requested to allocate funds towards student-facing services such as:<\/p><p>- Recruitment of additional Student Counsellors;<\/p><p>- Recruitment of additional Assistant Psychologists;<\/p><p>- Head of service posts for those HEIs employing more than 2 FTEs;<\/p><p>- Training of HEI staff to enable them to support and refer students to appropriate services;<\/p><p>- Raising awareness among students of mental health and wellbeing services available, including through student outreach activities;<\/p><p>- Implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework; and<\/p><p>- Implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs; Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive: Ending Sexual Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions.<\/p><p>HEIs were advised that the additional funding allocations\u00a0were intended to enhance rather than displace existing provision of student supports in the areas of mental health and wellbeing. HEIs were also advised to make provision for the sustainability of any supports funded under this allocation.<\/p><p>The HEA has advised my Department that the impacts of the funding has led to:<\/p><p>- increased capacity for students to avail of mental health services, especially in the provision of one-to-one sessions, and also, access to psychologists and in some institutions, to\u00a0psychiatrists;<\/p><p>- additional and significant provisions offered, including webinars, group sessions, online forums and the development of regular newsletters and e-zines, as well as increased social media presence;<\/p><p>- innovative outreach events and workshops in the areas of\u00a0consent, suicide prevention and addictive behaviours;<\/p><p>- HEIs developing systems and structures for improving services and other activities. For example, in larger institutions, case management and triaging processes have been implemented; and<\/p><p>- HEI staff\u00a0being able to avail of training sessions on mental health, thereby, raising the profile internally within HEIs of what services and supports are available for students.<\/p><p>A number of National Projects have also been implemented with funding provided for Mental Health and Wellbeing. These have produced dedicated tools, focused research and professional collaboration, which will support staff, augment policy-making and the effective targeting of resources across the sector to achieve the high standards set by the respective student well-being, consent and suicide prevention frameworks.<\/p><p>One such project is the 'Speak Out reporting tool' which was created as part of the implementation of the Framework for Consent, which I launched on 19 October 2021. The tool allows HEIs to understand staff and student experiences of sexual harassment and violence and assists institutions, the HEA and my department in making evidence-based policy decisions in this area. Most importantly, it raises awareness of the supports available to students and staff and encourages them to seek help if they need it.<\/p><p>In late 2020,\u00a0I launched the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. It recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support them\u00a0and respond through working proactively. The Framework provides clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties.<\/p><p>The HEA has established a cross-sectoral &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo; working group to support the implementation of the Framework. This group meets regularly to consider progress on the national framework and will identify examples of good practice for further sharing across the sector.<\/p><p>My Department will, in consultation with the HEA, consider the future funding needs of mental health services in higher education as part of the next estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600111#WRFFF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":3124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600111#WRFFF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":3125,"qnumday":1189,"qnumall":"[20127\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600111#WRFFF02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the drop-out rate of clinical counselling and educational psychologists and psychotherapy in each of the years since 2011, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":3126,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not held by my Department.

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes. Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA).

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes. Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In academic year 20\/21 the state contribution was &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":3230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG06000"},{"type":"question","counter":3231,"qnumday":1228,"qnumall":"[21129\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG06100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his Department&rsquo;s position on the delay in having electrical apprenticeships completed within the normal four-year term due to Covid; if the issue will be addressed in which phase seven is being completed approximately at four years and five months which is creating a backlog and delays in the qualification of much-needed electricians.","asker":"1491","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":3232,"qnumday":1230,"qnumall":"[21207\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG06200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department will examine the electrician apprentice scheme whereby serious delays in advancing are of concern to participants, for example, the advertised four years is becoming six years in certain cases, since the call to phase 2 advertised as being at six months has persons waiting 18 months and facing possibly 24 months in practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":3233,"qnumday":1232,"qnumall":"[21245\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG06300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if apprenticeship trades in the construction sector can be extended beyond the timeframe in which they are advertised to be completed; and his plans to remedy cases as outlined (details supplied).","asker":"1489","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":3234,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1228, 1230 and 1232 together.<\/p><p>Significant progress is being made in realising the ambition for apprenticeship set out in the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025<\/i>. The further development and mainstreaming of apprenticeship in Ireland through the creation of a single unified apprenticeship system has a key role to play in meeting Ireland's skill needs in a manner which presents a valued proposition for apprentices and employers alike.<\/p><p>The <i>Action Plan<\/i>sets a target of 10,000 annual apprentice registrations by 2025. In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006 figure of 8,306.<\/p><p>In 2021, 6,955 registrations were in craft apprenticeships, and largely in the construction sector, which will be vital for realising the ambition set out in <i>Housing for All<\/i>. There were 1,652 registrations on the newer, post-2016 programmes. At the end of 2021, the overall apprentice population was 24,212.<\/p><p>Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the COVID-related shutdown of on-site learning activity over the last two years had a significant impact on the ability of apprentices to access off-the-job training. Other apprenticeships have not been delayed in this way but may have had disruption to recruitment in, for instance, hospitality.<\/p><p>For the electrical apprenticeship in particular, while SOLAS endeavours to process apprentices in as timely a manner as possible, the overall duration of this apprenticeship is a minimum of four years for all phases to be successfully completed.<\/p><p>The waiting list is tackled in order of those apprentices who have been waiting longest.<\/p><p>A detailed and comprehensive emergency plan to tackle the apprentice waiting lists has been underway across further and higher education since August 2021 when some training facilities started to reopen. At that point 11,859 apprentices were delayed in their training.<\/p><p>Capital funding of &euro;20m was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade craft apprenticeship facilities across further and higher education institutions. Classes that were running at half capacity under COVID 19 measures are now back at their full intake of 14-16 apprentices since last September.<\/p><p>Additional funding of &euro;17m was provided under Budget 2022 to further facilitate the SOLAS and HEA&rsquo;s response to the backlogs. &euro;6m is being invested in additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved.<\/p><p>Changed delivery structures for Phase 2 off-the-job training, facilitating a third intake of apprentices per annum have been introduced. In December, an opt-in rapid employer assessment at Phase 7 (on-the-job) was completed for apprentices who had finished Phase 6 and spent more than four years in their apprenticeship <\/p><p>More than 8,400 apprentices, or over 70% of those who were delayed in their training by COVID, have now progressed in their off-the-job phases. This includes over 700 final year apprentices who have been fast-tracked to complete their qualification. There has been an increase of over 50% in the number of training places available, via additional workshops and 100+ additional staff. <\/p><p>As of end March 2022, 7,875 craft apprentices were waiting for access to phase 2, 4, or 6 off-the-job training.<\/p><p>My Department, SOLAS, and other apprenticeship partners are continuing to work actively on further measures to ensure that waiting times are resolved as speedily as possible, enabling apprentices to progress through their apprenticeship as quickly as is feasible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research Funding","counter":3235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG06500"},{"type":"question","counter":3236,"qnumday":1229,"qnumall":"[21171\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600112#WRGGG06600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the breakdown of Irish Research Council funding provided to each higher education institute and research-performing organisation in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":3237,"content":"<p>The Irish Research Council (IRC) is an associated agency of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, under the aegis of the HEA.

It offers a blended service of room based, telephone, and online video mediation, depending on the needs of the clients.

The Government has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of a range of legislative measures.<\/p><p>This includes\u00a0the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted and will provide, among other matters, for an increase in the penalty for conspiring to commit murder and soliciting to commit murder from a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<\/p><p>I consider a maximum sentence of life imprisonment to be appropriate given the seriousness of the offences in question. The Deputy will appreciate that, ultimately, the Judiciary is best placed to decide on the appropriate sentence in any given case. The impact of all violent crime spreads far wider than the victims alone and it is vital that the powers available to the Judiciary are such as to provide an appropriate deterrent for conspiring to commit the most heinous crime of taking a person's life.<\/p><p>Work is continuing on the drafting of this Bill based on the General Scheme and further legal advices. I hope to be in a position to publish these provisions in the second quarter of this year.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government\u00a0has in place the National Drugs and Alcohol Strategy, &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025&quot;. The Strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach\u00a0- reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at\u00a0reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use.\u00a0While this strategy supports the\u00a0vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, using advanced analytical and intelligence methods. Garda&iacute; target dangerous criminals and organised criminal groups through the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units and agencies such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.<\/p><p>The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely\u00a0with international law enforcement partners.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m and &pound;142,520 (UK) was forfeited to the State in 2021.<\/p><p>I can further inform the Deputy that on 2<sup><\/sup>July 2021,\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy,\u00a0Operation Tara,\u00a0which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. <\/p><p>Recent successes of Operation Tara include:<\/p><p>- &euro;1.75 million seizure of cocaine in Clondalkin on Friday, 15 April 2022.<\/p><p>- Approximately &euro;160,000 of suspected cocaine during the course of a search in County Wexford on the evening of 8 April 2022.<\/p><p>- &euro;580,000 in suspected cannabis herb and\u00a0a man arrested following a search operation in the Castleblayney area of Co. Monaghan on 8 April 2022.<\/p><p>- &euro;140,000 worth of diamorphine and \u00a0a man arrested following a search operation in Clondalkin on 30 March 2022.\u00a0<\/p><p>- &euro;700,000 of suspected heroin and one man arrested following a search operation in Co.

Only a minority of those experiencing domestic violence and engaging with support services need to access a refuge. In general terms, the need for provision of the current refuge model of service for men or transgender people on an extensive basis has not been a feature of Tusla engagement with stakeholders to date.<\/p>  <p>  However, Tusla recognises the importance of having available and responsive DSGBV services for people of all genders, with the need to consider access to safe accommodation for men fleeing domestic violence. To begin to address this, Tusla is focusing on developing pathways to safe accommodation for men. Access to designated safe supported domestic violence accommodation for men is being established in 2022 in the Dublin area initially, but it is expected that this type of initiative will be extended once an effective approach can be established.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tusla funds two organisations to provide dedicated supports to men who are dealing with domestic violence, Men&rsquo;s Aid and the Men&rsquo;s Development Network. Increased funding has been provided to both of these organisations since 2020 to extend their services.<\/p>  <p>  Both of these organisations can provide support, information and signposting for men who may need safe accommodation. Men (and their children, as relevant) who need to access accommodation because of domestic violence can be supported to access accommodation through Housing Authorities, and the Domestic Violence pathway to Rent Supplement introduced by the Department of Social Protection in 2020 is available to all victims, regardless of gender.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla published a review of accommodation for victims of domestic violence in February 2022.

Partners, work colleagues and friends should have these difficult conversations.<\/p><p>Over the past number of years, my Department been working to raise awareness generally about how we, as a society, need to stop excusing unacceptable behaviour.<\/p><p>The No Excuses campaign, for example, highlights this determination to challenge people and the culture, prejudice and values that allow any form of sexual harassment or sexual violence. As a society we all have a role to play in preventing sexual harassment and sexual violence and the No Excuses campaign underpins the message that sexual violence and harassment will not be tolerated and reminds people to take action when it is safe to do so.<\/p><p>Under the Third National Strategy, the Government will continue to work with our partners on raising awareness of DSGBV and on changing attitudes to it. As part of this we are developing an awareness campaign on the meaning and importance of consent in healthy relationships.<\/p><p>I am also focused on strengthening legislation to combat all forms of DSGBV and I recently secured Government approval to draft legislation to make stalking and non-fatal strangulation standalone offences.<\/p><p>While both stalking and non-fatal strangulation are already crimes, I am proposing a number of changes to make the law in this area clearer and stronger.<\/p><p>These new provisions, which will be included in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, will:<\/p><p>- Amend section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to introduce a standalone stalking offence, and amend the existing harassment offence<\/p><p>- Empower the courts to issue orders restraining stalking behaviours without a criminal prosecution<\/p><p>- Strengthen procedural protections for alleged victims of stalking during the court process<\/p><p>- Introduce a standalone offence of non-fatal strangulation<\/p><p>The evidence is that when a specific stalking offence is introduced, it leads to a greater awareness of the crime and an increase in the number of crimes reported and ultimately prosecuted.<\/p><p>In the summer, I will publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender. This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.<\/p><p>For other crimes, where there isn&rsquo;t a dedicated hate-aggravated offence, the new legislation will require the court to take misogyny into account where there is evidence that this was the motivation, to reflect that fact in the sentence, and to reflect the fact that the crime was aggravated by this form of prejudice in the formal record. <\/p><p>Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill which will introduce important changes including:<\/p><p>- Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims<\/p><p>- Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public<\/p><p>- Legal representation for victims <\/p><p>Separately, I will seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill within months which will strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600115#WRKKK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":3421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600115#WRKKK04000"},{"type":"question","counter":3422,"qnumday":1292,"qnumall":"[20365\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600115#WRKKK04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 606 of 1 March 2022, if her Departments review of the new scorecard system for persons who have recently turned 18 is finalised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":3423,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the review is due to be finalised shortly and the updated scorecards are expected to issue in the coming weeks.

I fully appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to our pets and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that theft offences already apply to this crime, and can carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.<\/p><p>When imposing sentence, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet &ndash; the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be, and is, taken into account where appropriate. However, I acknowledge that the existing offence considers the offence as being one against property rather than a person or an animal and I am committed to examining the options to address the issue, including, if necessary, making legislative changes.<\/p><p>From an enforcement perspective, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes this issue very seriously and has conducted several important actions against those responsible. Garda&iacute; have also disseminated information through the national Crime Prevention Officer Network regarding keeping animals secure and preventing these forms of theft. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website.<\/p><p>I would like to also emphasise the importance of microchipping. Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth (Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015), and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals&rsquo; welfare, and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped and it is an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at vets and by Garda&iacute;. They are by far and away the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs.<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture have also made regulations covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pets Regulations) 2019.<\/p><p>I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na record and investigate any report of the theft of a dog in line with their crime recording and investigation policies.

I am advised that this will be achieved through the following measures;<\/p>  <p>  - Allocating overt beat personnel to Luas, DART and Bus services to perform high visibility patrols to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour and public order offences.<\/p>  <p>  - Reducing opportunities for anti-social behaviour while dealing proactively and professionally with any public order issues through a zero tolerance approach.<\/p>  <p>  - Acting to prevent and detect crime, preserve the peace and minimise disruption to Luas, DART and Bus services.<\/p>  <p>  - In partnership with partner agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deployed on duties under Operation Saul will achieve a common goal of making this service safe. <\/p>  <p>  - Improve the quality of day to day life for local stakeholders, businesses and commuters of Luas, DART and Bus services.<\/p>  <p>  - Issuing Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO) where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  - Issuing Fixed Charge Penalty Notices (FCPNs) in respect of certain offences, where detected and appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  - Effecting arrests in appropriate circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  - Record all patrols under Operation Saul with Superintendent, Communications Centre on CAD incident number.<\/p>  <p>  Each Chief Superintendent in the DMR ensures regular collaboration under Operation Saul with partner agencies in order to ensure the success and sustainability of the initiative. Central to the success of this initiative is maintaining a strong partnership with transport partner agencies. Quarterly, if not more regular, meetings are required to take place between appropriate members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in each Division in the DMR to examine any issues and review existing approaches and to inform partner agencies on upcoming plans, operations and advancements in the area of managing these issues in the public transport sphere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600116#WRLLL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":3469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600116#WRLLL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":3470,"qnumday":1309,"qnumall":"[21079\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600116#WRLLL02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps that she is taking in relation to homophobic assaults and violence.","asker":"1525","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":3471,"content":"<p>I strongly condemn the actions of the small minority who subject others to abuse or attack resulting from their own prejudice.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We live in a diverse and welcoming country and our law and values should reflect this. Work is ongoing as a priority to legislate for hate crime and hate speech, to ensure that Ireland is a safe and secure place for all.<\/p>  <p>  A hate crime occurs where an offence is committed (for example assault or criminal damage), but where the victim is targeted because of their association, in the mind of the perpetrator, with a particular identity characteristic, e.g. sexual orientation or ethnicity.<\/p>  <p>  Hate crimes are signal crimes. They tell the victim that they are not safe simply because of who they are. They send the disgusting message to victims that they, and people like them, are somehow lesser than the rest of us which is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  These crimes are motivated by prejudice. They make victims feel afraid for their future, their friends and their families. They lead to a divided society, where whole communities can feel unsafe and angry. It&rsquo;s important that we recognize the true harm of these crimes and ensure that our legislative framework can tackle them.<\/p>  <p>  On 16 April 2021 I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021. Following its publication, the General Scheme was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny, which took place on 17 November 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I recently published Justice Plan 2022 and in it I have committed to advancing this work and to publishing the Hate Crime Bill in quarter 2 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. The aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty, compared to the ordinary offence, and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.<\/p>  <p>  It may also interest the Deputy to know that Ireland&rsquo;s first National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022 was published on 28 November 2019 and complements the National LGBTI Youth Strategy published in June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Inclusion strategy was developed in partnership with the LGBTI+ Community through a number of consultations and workshops across the country. A Strategy Committee is in place to oversee implementation of the Inclusion Strategy. This Committee is chaired by Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, T.D.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy contains a number of actions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deepen the LGBTI+ awareness among frontline officers and increase the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to the needs of victims of hate crime and to have an improved understanding of the LGBTI+ community in general.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ongoing national response to Hate Crime, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) provide assurance to members of the public in relation to reports of hate-based occurrences. This includes daily monitoring of all recorded Hate Crimes \/ Incidents on PULSE and Social Media, advising investigating members, supporting investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that in response to recent alleged homophobic incidents, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit have provided direct on the ground support to investigators and to the LGBT+ community<\/p>  <p>  A new, non-emergency Online Hate Crime reporting mechanism was launched in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of Hate Crime. It is available via the garda.ie website and provides a safe and secure environment for victims, who may previously have been reluctant to report in person to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  To increase confidence and provide support and direction to Garda members in identifying, recording, investigating and prosecuting Hate Crime, a Policy Document - Responding to Hate Crime and Non-Crime Hate Incidents was developed and published in 2021. Additional procedures, aide memoire and information sheets have been provided to all Garda personnel and published on internal platforms.<\/p>  <p>  A number of publicity campaigns have been held in support of the launch of the Online Hate Crime Reporting System, which included publicity and explanatory videos on garda.ie (script in 19 languages); and a Hate Crime information campaign with the publication and distribution of Hate Crime leaflets in 19 languages.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Internal communication platforms were utilised to run in conjunction with public campaigns. A further Hate Crime publicity campaign is planned for 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Following a full independent review of the Garda Diversity Training in January 2020, a new organisational approach to training is in the final stages of development and will be delivered throughout 2022. The training programme will increase Garda confidence in dealing with reports of Hate Crime.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that Garda Diversity Officers (GDOs) are Garda&iacute; and Sergeants, trained, developed and supported to actively engage with and attend to the concerns of minority, diverse and hard to reach communities - providing reassurance, building trust and extending the accessibility of the Garda Service.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 331 GDOs throughout the country in every Garda division, who are supported by a Divisional Diversity Inspector. An up-to-date list containing the locations and contact details of GDOs is published on the Garda website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600116#WRLLL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gangland Crime","counter":3472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600116#WRLLL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":3473,"qnumday":1310,"qnumall":"[21100\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600116#WRLLL02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to improve legislation tackling gangland crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":3474,"content":"<p>Tackling organised criminal activity is a key priority for the Government and an ongoing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including operational matters and the deployment of resources. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is currently being drafted and will provide, among other matters, for an increase in the penalty for conspiring to commit murder and soliciting to commit murder from a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  I consider a maximum sentence of life imprisonment to be appropriate given the seriousness of the offences in question. The Deputy will appreciate that, ultimately, the Judiciary is best placed to decide on the appropriate sentence in any given case. The impact of all violent crime spreads far wider than the victims alone and it is vital that the powers available to the Judiciary are such as to provide an appropriate deterrent for conspiring to commit the most heinous crime of taking a person's life.<\/p>  <p>  Work is continuing on the drafting of this Bill based on the General Scheme and further legal advices. Justice Plan 2022 commits to the publication of these provisions in the second quarter of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Justice Plan also commits to working to break the link between gangs and the children they seek to recruit. In 2022, we will progress draft legislation to outlaw the grooming of children into a life of crime. In parallel, we will continue to roll out a community intervention programme &ldquo;Greentown&rdquo; which seeks to break the link between children who are engaged or at risk of engaging with a criminal gang.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These new measures will build on legislative measures which have already been taken in recent years, such as:<\/p>  <p>  - The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016, which provides additional Garda powers for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of;<\/p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, providing for the establishment and operation of the DNA database providing Garda&iacute; with links between people and unsolved crimes;<\/p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including potential intimidation of juries.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strengthened its capacity to tackle organised crime in 2015, through the creation of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), which is headed by a Detective Chief Superintendent reporting to Assistant Commissioner, Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime. The role is to proactively, via intelligence led investigations, target top tier Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) impacting on this jurisdiction.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This is achieved through effective collaboration with all sections of Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime, and other sections within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through partnerships with other law enforcement agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service, and partnerships developed with international law enforcement agencies globally.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m and &pound;142,520 (UK) was forfeited to the State in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that on 2\u00a0July 2021,\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy,\u00a0Operation Tara,\u00a0which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.<\/p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year.

Cardiac rehabilitation is considered an essential component of secondary prevention for patients with cardiovascular disease due to the rigorous and extensive evidence base supporting its clinical effectiveness and is of importance for patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure.<\/p>  <p>  Cardiac Rehabilitation is specifically tailored for those with established CVD, and patient outcomes are highly dependent on the quality of CR service delivered. Cardiac Rehabilitation is delivered through four phases, from the initial cardiac event in hospital to phase four in the community. The number of patients (5,063) accessing CR in 2019 increased by 25% from 2010.\u00a0 There are also ever-increasing referrals of more complex, older and frail patients with multiple comorbidities to cardiac rehabilitation programmes which, while bringing additional challenges, can result in tremendous individual gains in health and wellbeing for those patients.<\/p>  <p>  Recent Irish Heart Attack Audit data suggest a 71% referral rate to cardiac rehabilitation programmes.\u00a0 There are at least 36 centres in Ireland providing cardiac rehabilitation services nationally. Recommendations from &ldquo;Changing Cardiovascular Health National Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010 &ndash; 2019&rdquo; recognised a need to establish or redirect services to address effectively the common rehabilitation goals of all cardiovascular patients. Increasing participation in chronic disease self-management programmes is central to Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 under the Chairmanship of Professor Phillip Nolan and a Steering Group formed from nominations of interested stakeholders representing medical, professional\/technical staff, nursing and patient representatives.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Cardiac Services Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive, by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme and includes cardiac rehabilitation services in its work.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report with the next meeting planned for May 2022 The implementation process for the National Cardiac Services Review is also being developed as part of the process to finalise the Report.

They encourage the sharing of experience and learning across the public sector and provide excellent development opportunities for civil and public servants to better serve the public interest.<\/p><p>My Department does not comment on specific contractual matters for individual employees but as of 25th April 2022, 14 of the Department&rsquo;s employees in various grades from Clerical Officer through to Principal Officer are seconded to other organisations. The duration of these secondments varies between six months and five years, with some having provision for renewal if agreed between the Department, the host organisation and the secondee.  These arrangements include the National Economic &amp;amp; Social Council, Department of Defence, Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Education, Central Statistics Office, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  There are a variety of ways in which secondments out of the Department arise.  Some arise from advertisements by host organisations, some (e.g. the secondment of Department of Health staff to the Permanent Representation in Brussels) are a matter for the Department to determine through its own internal processes.  In some situations, arrangements will be made for individual employees with particular skills and experience to second to another Department by agreement between the two Departments concerned.  <\/p><p>  Where an individual is seconded to another civil service organisation, in line with the secondment policy for the civil service they would normally transfer to the payroll of the host organisation for administrative efficiency reasons.  Some specific schemes such as NEPT placements with the EU institutions and coordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, would involve the Department covering the payroll and associated costs of an employee working temporarily with the EU.<\/p><p>  Secondees retain the term and conditions of their employment including pension rights.  No person currently seconded out from the Department has formally relinquished their employment within the Department and would therefore be expected to return to a role in the Department when their secondment is complete.  It is not unusual, however, for secondees to secure a promotion or move to new employment while seconded out which means they do not ultimately return.<\/p><p>  There are a large variety of arrangements, some long-standing, for those seconded into my Department.  At the present time there are 53 people seconded into the Department of Health from other organisations. These can be on the basis of an advertisement of the available secondment to the civil or public service, in particular the health service, as appropriate.  In some cases they arise from long-standing arrangements (e.g. with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Central Statistics Office) for the placement of staff with the Department based on specific required expertise, or where specific health service employees are seconded in to work with the Department on particular projects. <\/p><p>  Secondees into the Department are from a range of organisations including the Departments of Finance, Justice, Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and Transport; other civil service organisations including the Central Statistics Office, Office of the Attorney General, the Revenue Commissioners, Office of the Information Commissioner, the Courts Service, the National Shared Services Office and the Office of Government Procurement; various bodies under the aegis of the Department including the HSE, various section 38 bodies funded by the HSE, a number of health sector regulatory bodies and other public sector bodies such as Tusla.  <\/p><p>  For those seconded in, payment arrangements generally involve a recoupment by the Department of the pay and pension costs involved to the parent organisation or in respect of the civil service, by the transfer of the individual to the Department&rsquo;s payroll.  In some cases, where a specific project requires the individual to work closely with the Department&rsquo;s staff to advance a particular policy on a partnership basis, no recoupment to the parent organisation is being made.  <\/p><p>I have asked the HSE to collate the information and respond directly to the Deputy in relation to its own employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600119#WROOO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3715,"content":"<p>Question No. 1387 answered with Question No. 1386.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3716,"content":"<p>Question No. 1388 answered with Question No. 1386.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":3717,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600119#WROOO04600"},{"type":"question","counter":3718,"qnumday":1389,"qnumall":"[19412\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042600119#WROOO04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current acute inpatient and critical care bed capacity by bed type, for example, intensive care unit, high dependency unit, inpatient acute, sub-acute and any other, at each model 2, 3 and 4 hospital on 1 April 2022, including for each section 38 public voluntary hospital in which the information must be requested, in tabular form;
