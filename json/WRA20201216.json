The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November\u00a02019 with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).<\/p><p>I\u00a0appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. It will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>  Further details are available on specific areas within Counties Westmeath and Longford through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises\u00a0as works\u00a0commence. I am aware\u00a0that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network\u00a0and I am advised that\u00a0NBI is working\u00a0to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.<\/p><p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of\u00a010 December 2020, over 145,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company.\u00a0Surveys have been completed in County Westmeath in the areas of Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown and Athlone.\u00a0Surveys have been completed in County Longford in the areas of\u00a0 Drumlish, Ennybegs, Moat Farrell, Cullyfad, Longford Town, Newtownforbes, Cloondara, Stonepark, Ardagh, Moydow and Kilashee. The next step is for NBI to develop network designs to deliver the new fibre to the home network to these premises, followed by pre build and build works. I understand that surveys are due to commence in the locations referred to by the Deputy between Q4 2021 and Q4 2022 and NBI will publish target build dates on completion of survey work. <\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.\u00a0As of 4 December, 217 sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education for schools. 59 publicly accessible BCPs across the country are now live. BCPs locations installed\u00a0in Westmeath include Streete Parish Park and Community Hall, Whitehall Community Centre, Milltown Emper Community Centre\u00a0and Ballycomoyle GAA Club which are due to be connected \u00a0in the coming months. BCP locations installed in Longford include\u00a0Ballymore Shamrocks GAA Club, Mullinalaghta Community Centre, Colmcille GAA Club, Corlea Heritage Centre and Aughine Community Centre which are due to be connected in the coming months.\u00a0Further details can be found at https:\/\/nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride in Co Westmeath is connected for educational access as part of this initiative.

An interactive map showing ESB charger locations and their status\u00a0can be found at www.esb.ie\/ecars.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;10 million has been committed\u00a0from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network and this has leveraged\u00a0a further\u00a0&euro;10 million investment from ESB.

The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs.\u00a0In terms of cost to the Exchequer this scheme would potentially require in the region\u00a0of &euro;4.5 million to support the installation of 900 charge points. However, overall costs for installing any given charge point will also be influenced by type of charger, location and\u00a0scope of civil and electrical works\u00a0to be carried out which can very significantly from site to site. It should also be noted that several private\u00a0entities are operating in this space however information relating to the costs associated with these sites would be commercially\u00a0sensitive\u00a0and therefore not publically available. <\/p>  <p>  Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will be key in helping to\u00a0sustain and\u00a0 support the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads.\u00a0Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging\u00a0in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cost effective\u00a0form of charging. To support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my\u00a0Department, administers an EV\u00a0home charger grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit. Again in terms of costs to Exchequer the cost of providing\u00a0support to\u00a0install 900 of these home chargers would be in the region of &euro;540,000 but again the full costs of installation will depend on location, type of charger being installed and specific site characteristics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600094#WRC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600094#WRC04300"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[44020\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600094#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the current budgets in his Department for social media advertising for 2021; and the campaigns behind each budget line in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>My Department is currently finalising programme budgets for 2021, which will include any budget requirements for specific communications campaigns, including social media requirements.<\/p><p>Expenditure on communications, press and public relations falls under the Department's various administrative and programme budgets and is not profiled as a single expenditure item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600094#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600094#WRC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[44078\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600094#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the steps he will take to explore the potential for offshore wind farms in north County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to producing a plan setting out a path to achieve 5GW of offshore wind by 2030 as well as a long term plan setting out how we will take advantage of the significant potential of offshore energy on the Atlantic Coast, in particular taking advantage of a potential of at least 30GW of offshore floating wind power in the Atlantic.

However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the issue highlighted in the question, I would first of all recommend that the individual in question ought to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover including flood insurance, at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.  In addition, the person has the right to make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.<\/p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  - Investing almost &euro;1 billion to flood relief measures over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027. <\/p>  <p>  - Implementation of flood relief management plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW), and;   <\/p>  <p>  - Maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in affected areas.<\/p>  <p>  The above approach is underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and industry representatives Insurance Ireland, who meet on a quarterly basis to help implement this initiative. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should in turn provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas. <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, some householders are still experiencing difficulties. This is particularly the case for households in areas with demountable flood defences.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the challenges of property insurance and flooding as part of the action points for my Department under the Climate Action Plan. Over the last year it launched a public consultation on Climate Change and Insurance and subsequently met with interested parties. The key themes that arose from the consultation related to (i) the lack of data on flood insurance coverage and (ii) the challenges of obtaining flood cover in areas with demountable defences. My Department is now meeting with key stakeholders such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the OPW, Irish Public Bodies, and the State Claims Agency to further review the issues raised and assess a feasible way forward.  This review is in progress and my Department will continue to provide updates on this work stream to the Climate Action Delivery Board.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to proactively engage on all aspects of insurance reform including flood insurance issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600096#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600096#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[44095\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600096#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has had discussions with the banks about the State purchasing houses that may be unoccupied and owned by the various banks at this time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[44096\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600096#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of unoccupied houses owned by the banks in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 87 together.<\/p><p>I presume that the Deputy is referring to properties which are in the possession of financial institutions arising from a default on a mortgage loan. <\/p><p>The Central Bank has supplied me with the table below which provides a summary of properties held by both bank and non-bank entities as at end September-2020. The collected data does not provide details on whether the property is currently occupied or not. The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Residential Mortgage Arrears, Restructures and Repossession Statistics provides further data in relation to the number of repossessed properties held by both banks and non-bank entities and this is available at: <\/p><p>. <\/p><p><b>Repossessions: Residential properties in possession, as at end-September 2020<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>PDH<\/th>       <th>BTL<\/th>       <th>Total<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Banks<\/td>       <td>629<\/td>       <td>302<\/td>       <td>931<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Non-Banks<\/td>       <td>172<\/td>       <td>89<\/td>       <td>261<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>801<\/td>       <td>391<\/td>       <td>1,192<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>It should be noted that the financial institution does not 'own' the properties in its possession following a mortgage default; instead its purpose is to realise the security for the purposes of repaying the mortgage loan and with any surplus remaining from the sale going to the mortgagor\/owner.  In fulfilling this sale function the lender is obliged, as far as is reasonably practicable, to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the property.  <\/p><p>The decision to repossess a property as the result of a mortgage default is ultimately a commercial decision for the lender to make considering all the relevant factors, including that all legal requirements are met. For example, in the case of a mortgage secured on a Primary Dwelling House, the provisions of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears will apply and the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) will have to be followed.  <\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme, which was introduced in 2012, is targeted at those households in mortgage arrears who are eligible for social housing support whose mortgage has been deemed unsustainable by their lender under the MARP and who have very limited options, if any, to meet their long-term housing needs themselves.  The scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body or Private Company to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage from a lender and which will also enable the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  The scheme is part of the overall suite of social housing options and is an important part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.<\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, advises me that up to the end of November 2020, 884 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 884 households in the scheme represent 1,493 adults and 1,399 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently 1,296 active cases being progressed under the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600096#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600096#WRE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[43673\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600096#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason an organisation (details supplied) has not been facilitated for the employment wage subsidy scheme for September 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the introduction of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).

The Regulations apply on a geographical basis and the premises must be located in the relevant geographical area. <\/p><p>For the purposes of CRSS a business premises is defined in the legislation as being &ldquo;a building or other similar fixed physical structure from which a business activity is ordinarily carried on&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The legislation further requires that &ldquo;applicable business restrictions provisions prohibit, or significantly restrict, members of the public from having access to the business premises in which the relevant business activity of the person is carried on&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  It is also not sufficient that a business is experiencing a reduction in demand for its goods or services because of Covid-19.

There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.<\/p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme was introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes. The scheme is particularly targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs is met upfront with a capital loan from the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB) up to a maximum of &euro;60,000. This allows the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement with a local authority or an AHB for a period of time that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum lease period of 5 years. Up to end 2019, a total of 165 homes had been brought back into use under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A similar measure entitled the Buy and Renew Scheme supports local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the suitability of a property for social housing. Important considerations in this regard include the location of a property in relation to housing need and demand; the design, scale and suitability of a property for social housing use; and the costs and practicality of acquiring and remediating a property.<\/p>  <p>  The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  As a complementary initiative to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, it provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners of the properties concerned. Up until end June 2020, local authorities delivered over 585 new social homes under the scheme.  Activity in this regard is largely delegated to local authorities so they can respond flexibly to all opportunities to provide new social housing.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of Social Housing, my Department can provide full funding to local authorities for sites on which they bring forward suitable new social housing construction projects, including sites acquired by compulsory purchase orders for instance. I am keen to see our local authorities expand their ownership of suitable sites for new social housing and with the record funding levels we have secured for new social housing delivery in 2021, we are in a position to support new projects including the associated site costs. It would be important for local authorities to engage with my Department directly and through the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office on this important issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.<\/p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Sites Levy and the Vacant Sites Levy increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600098#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600098#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[43645\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600098#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":" if minutes should be kept at preplanning meetings in local authorities.","asker":"1504","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>Provision is made under section 247(5) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, that the planning authority shall keep a record in writing of any consultations or request for consultations under this section that relate to a proposed development, including the names of those who participated in the consultations or request for consultations. <\/p>  <p>  It is further required that a copy of such record shall be placed and kept with the documents to which any planning application in respect of the proposed development relates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600098#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Increases","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600098#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[43734\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600098#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to instances in which landlords are increasing the rental price on their properties that are inside rent pressure zones by storing personal belongings in same; if he will provide a schedule of exemptions to the rules on price increases on properties for rent inside rent pressure zones (details supplied).","asker":"1489","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020, to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.

The annual rent increase restriction applies to both new and existing tenancies, irrespective of a change of landlord.<\/p><p>Not all properties in RPZs are subject to the 4% restriction. <\/p><p>An exemption applies to the first rent setting of a tenancy of a dwelling where:<\/p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling during the two years immediately prior to this current tenancy beginning;<\/p><p>or<\/p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling where the dwelling is a protected structure, or is in a protected structure or is a proposed protected structure during the 12 months immediately prior to the current tenancy beginning.

My Department supports fire authorities through general policy-setting and preparing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.<\/p>  <p>  Roscommon County Council provides its fire services from fire stations at Roscommon town, Elphin, Boyle, Ballaghdereen and Strokestown.

It also runs both statutory and community fire safety services. <\/p>  <p>  My Department was informed by Roscommon County Council in February 2017 that, due to a particular local circumstance, Castlerea fire brigade was being stood down.

Although the report found that the Defence Forces regime appears to be capable of meeting statutory requirements, it makes a number of observations; including in relation to documentation, health surveillance, and exposure monitoring.

The report of the independent reviewer was provided to the individuals who made the protected disclosures and it was also published on the Department of Defence website. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016 by the HSA, the Air Corps had continued to work with the HSA to improve its health and safety regime.

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, importantly, in consultation with parents and having regard to the ethos of the school. Curricular provision for Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and RSE across primary and post-primary level is aimed at ensuring that topics are covered in an age appropriate manner. The teaching of RSE is mandatory up to and including Senior Cycle (Leaving Cert).<\/p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) supports the personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them create and maintain supportive relationships. RSE forms a key part of this. RSE has been a compulsory part of the primary and post-primary curriculum since the late 1990s. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, then Minister for Education and Skills Mr. Richard Bruton asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The review originated from the June 2017 report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the 8th Amendment to the Constitution and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the 8th Amendment&rsquo;s report of December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA is the body which has statutory responsibility to advise the Minister on the contents of curriculum. It conducted a thorough and transparent review, including consideration of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the 8th Amendment&rsquo;s report and published its report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo; in December 2019. This report was developed on foot of extensive consultation which was conducted between June 2018 and March 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA were asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum, in particular the importance of consent and what it means. Other areas looked at included, but were not limited to: developments in relation to contraception; healthy, positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet; the role of school ethos: and, LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. These include primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and SPHE in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE\/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised. <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work until recent months due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. Both the primary and post primary development groups have met, first on the 20th of October and a further two times since. Further meetings are scheduled for 2021 at a similar pace.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has worked collaboratively with the teacher professional development support services and other relevant groups in completing an audit of current teaching and learning resources relevant to SPHE\/RSE and compiled a comprehensive resource list which will be published as part of an online toolkit for SPHE\/RSE. This will provide a single, online access point for up-to-date resources. <\/p>  <p>  Further recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE are being considered by my Department with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600100#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600100#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[43713\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600100#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a refund or credit will be extended to pupils whose school bus tickets have been issued only in recent weeks and who have been charged for the full term up to the Christmas break.","asker":"1596","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.   <\/p>  <p>  In the 2019\/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.

Schools have put significant measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to\/within the school and significant funding has been provided to support schools in this respect.  The evidence to date from a public health perspective is that schools are safe.  The approach to Covid-19 in schools is led by the advice and guidance of the HSE Public Health.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the measures promoted by HPSC.<\/p>  <p>  The advice outlines the view of public health that given current knowledge about COVID-19 disease in children, it is difficult to justify cocooning in most children with underlying conditions. Long-term cocooning of children with complex medical needs is likely to adversely affect them and may outweigh the potential risk of infection. <\/p>  <p>  The HPSC advice goes on to advise that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members.

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;37,692.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).<\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.  This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.<\/p>  <p>  On 10 December 2020, draft proposals on a new public service pay agreement were agreed following formal discussions between DPER and the Public Services Committee of ICTU, with consultation and input from the sectors including my Department. These proposals will now be considered in detail by the various unions and their members. There is a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. This builds on the series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through the various pay agreements. It shows the benefits that continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions can bring.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the percentage of teachers that are post-2011 entrants to the teaching profession, of the teachers paid from my Department&rsquo;s payroll 29.8% are categorised as post-2011 entrants at Primary level and 29.1% at Post-Primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600101#WRK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600101#WRK04300"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[44085\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600101#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a contingency plan will be published for students of the leaving certificate 2021.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and which led the decision not to run the state examinations this summer.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the return to schools of students for the 2020\/21 academic year my Department published a range of documentation and support material as part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, which is available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. That schools have remained open throughout level 5 restrictions has been very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019\/20 and may occur in 2020\/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. <\/p>  <p>  It is my firm intention to operate the conventional 2021 state examinations, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations<\/p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.  It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.  These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and my Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service. The group met for a second time on 14 December.<\/p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 981,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2020 is &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the free travel scheme is to ensure that older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community.  The Free Travel Scheme was never intended as a targeted support for people with severe mobility issues.  The Free Travel Scheme was also never intended to provide additional transport options to travel pass holders but to allow them access to existing services available from transport providers who participate in the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key aspects of the free travel scheme is that the service provided is via open, publicly available services.  Wheelchair accessible taxis are private hire vehicles and any decision to allow free travel pass holders to use their free travel passes on a category of private hire vehicles would lead to similar requests from other groups that provide private hire vehicles.  It would lead to a fundamental change to the nature of the Free Travel Scheme and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide an estimate of the possible cost of extending the free travel scheme to allow persons with a disability to travel by taxi as the cost would be determined by such factors as the number of such journeys undertaken by each free travel pass holder, the length of each journey and also if the journey is undertaken with a companion\/companions.  However, it would be expected that the increased cost to the free travel scheme would be very significant and would also have to include increased administrative costs to deal with the fundamental adjustment in the administration of any such complex scheme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does provide an annual funding contribution of &euro;1.5 million from the Free Travel budget provision towards the Transport for Ireland Local Links Programme, which is administered by the National Transport Authority under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Programme provides services to people whose travel needs are not met by existing bus or train services.  The Programme aims to enhance and sustain nationwide accessibility through community based participation, particularly for those at risk of social exclusion.  Services provided include door to door services on certain routes.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme supports may be available to assist with necessary travel costs. The support can either be on a once-off basis as an exceptional needs payment or as a supplement where there is an ongoing need.  There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.  At the end of 2019, 141 persons were in receipt of a Travel Supplement.

This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.<\/p><p>The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of COVID-19 and for up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  Certification by a registered medical professional is required to support any claim for the special COVID-19 Illness payment.  There are no waiting days in respect of the enhanced illness benefit payment.  Only one contribution is required in the four weeks before the claim, thereby making the payment more accessible.<\/p><p>Where a medical practitioner advises a person to remain away from work because an underlying medical condition means they are unable to work safely, then the standard Illness Benefit payment may be made, subject to the conditions of the scheme being satisfied. <\/p><p>It should be noted that employers are asked to facilitate remote working where possible &ndash; in this situation people should remain on full pay from the employer.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).<\/p>  <p>   A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021 to allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services in mid- 2022. In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan that anticipates the commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.  In tandem with this work, progress is also being made to finalise the amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to streamline the processes envisaged under the 2015 Act and to support the DSS to become operational.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600103#WRM04387","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600103#WRM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[43674\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600103#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the rules and regulations attached to the placement of children in foster care; his views on whether many of the restrictions placed upon children in such care may actually be having a negative rather than the hoped-for positive effect upon the health and well-being of the child (details supplied); his plans to order a review of such restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":615,"content":"<p>Since public health restrictions were introduced Tusla has demonstrated a strong commitment to ensuring children in care, where it is assessed as in their best interests, have contact with their families.

These payments will be backdated to the start of their placements from September 2020.<\/p><p>I am not aware of any lack of desirability to undertake the educational processes necessary to graduate from nursing or midwifery degree courses, or wider healthcare courses.  <\/p><p>A large number of students apply for places in healthcare courses each year through the CAO. Health and welfare is the most popular category of courses, with 15,300 CAO applicants placing a Health and Welfare course as their first preference choice on the CAO. However only 5,800 of these were successful in gaining a place in a health and welfare course, as entry to these courses is highly competitive and there is consistently high demand.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: CAO First preferences and acceptances by subject area, 2019<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Subject Area<\/th>       <th>First   Preferences<\/th>       <th>Acceptances<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Welfare<\/td>       <td>15287<\/td>       <td>5815<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Business, administration and law<\/td>       <td>12450<\/td>       <td>7278<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Arts and Humanities<\/td>       <td>11673<\/td>       <td>9006<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Engineering, manufacturing and construction<\/td>       <td>6678<\/td>       <td>3767<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Natural sciences, mathematics and statistics<\/td>       <td>5920<\/td>       <td>4362<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Social sciences, journalism and information<\/td>       <td>5445<\/td>       <td>2835<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Education<\/td>       <td>5285<\/td>       <td>2452<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Information and Communication Technologies<\/td>       <td>3967<\/td>       <td>2390<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Services<\/td>       <td>2360<\/td>       <td>1070<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Agriculture, forestry, fisheries and veterinary<\/td>       <td>1837<\/td>       <td>706<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>All Courses<\/td>       <td>70902<\/td>       <td>39681<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>This is particularly true in the case of nursing and midwifery.

The Government has always sought to acknowledge and address the legitimate needs and expectations of victims&rsquo; families and survivors of Troubles-related attacks in this jurisdiction. <\/p><p>A substantive measure in this regard was the establishment of the Remembrance Commission in 2003, to administer a Scheme of acknowledgment, assistance and remembrance for victims of the Northern Ireland conflict, and their families, in this jurisdiction. The Commission continued in this work until 2008 and administered Acknowledgement payments, Economic Hardship payments, Displacement payments and Medical payments for victims&rsquo; families and those who were seriously injured in Troubles-related incidents in this jurisdiction. The Remembrance Commission also funded memorials such as the one in Belturbet.<\/p><p>On the conclusion of the Commission's term of appointment, special arrangements were put in place to ensure that victims resident in the jurisdiction who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the Troubles may have these costs reimbursed through the Victims of Crime Office of my Department. This scheme continues to this day.  <\/p><p>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal makes awards to people who have suffered an injury sustained within the State on or after 1st October, 1972. The tribunal considers applications from people who suffer a personal injury or death as a result of a crime of violence. Ex gratia compensation may be awarded on the basis of any vouched out of pocket expenses, including loss of earnings experienced by the victim or, if the victim has died as a result of the incident, by the dependents of the victim. <\/p><p>The Reconciliation Fund, operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, was established in 1982 to support civil society organisations in creating a better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland, and also between Ireland and Britain.  One of the key thematic pillars under which funding is awarded is the <i>repairing of those issues which lead to division, conflict, and barriers to a deeply reconciled and peaceful society.<\/i>In that context, the Reconciliation Fund provides grant support to organisations working with victims and survivors of the Troubles, where it is considered that proposed projects have the potential to promote reconciliation in line with the particular eligibility criteria of the Fund.  <\/p><p>Irish Departments have also provided co-funding for projects under the PEACE III programme (2007-2013), and, currently, under the PEACE IV programme (2014-2020).  The North South PEACE IV Programme is co-funded by the EU and Government Departments in Ireland and Northern Ireland and it aims to support peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland.  Funding of &euro;17.6m under PEACE IV is provided for the Victims and Survivors Service project which aims to improve the health and well-being of victims and survivors and to support marginalised individuals and communities that that have suffered as a result of the Troubles. This action is delivered by the Victims and Survivors Services in Northern Ireland which provides funding supports to organisations to employ Health and Wellbeing Case Managers, Health and Wellbeing Caseworkers, Advocacy Case Managers, Advocacy Caseworkers for victims and survivors irrespective of their place of residence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600104#WRN04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600104#WRN05000"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[43629\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600104#WRN05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when payment will issue in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1602","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that the payment direction in relation to this application was sent by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal secretariat to the Department&rsquo;s Financial Shared Services Unit on 11 December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  It will be processed by the Department&rsquo;s Financial Shared Services Unit in line with the standard procedures in place for payments of this nature and the payment is expected to issue to the payee within the next seven days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600104#WRN05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Social Behaviour","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600104#WRN05300"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[43614\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600104#WRN05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider publishing media advertisements in the run-up to Christmas regarding the dangers of illegal scrambler use; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that I view the illegal use of scramblers, as well as mopeds and quad bikes, as a very serious matter, especially over the Christmas period.

This collaboration has resulted in an awareness campaign being rolled out in the lead up to Christmas, with the campaign ads asking parents not to buy scramblers or quad-bikes as presents for their children and highlighting the dangers involved with these vehicles. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised my Department that Garda&iacute; respond to all reports of anti-social behaviour and conduct operations on an ongoing basis to target the anti-social activities of persons using scramblers, mopeds and quads in parks and greens, and have also highlighted the dangers associated with the use of these vehicles through various media and social media platforms. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles this behaviour from a number of fronts, with targeted enforcement in areas with high activity, working with petrol stations to prohibit the sale of fuel to persons who are using these vehicles, as well as community outreach. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are committed to carrying out enforcement with increased visibility in areas which are most affected by the issue, and this will continue.  <\/p>  <p>  For example, in the Finglas area last year on Christmas morning, a major Garda operation was put in place, involving members attached to Regular Policing Units, District Detective Units, Specialist Units and Divisional and Regional Traffic.

The reasons for a judge's decision not to release records would be pronounced in open court and could be included in any order that is handed down. <\/p><p>The court may turn down an application for a recording or transcript where the person making the application is unconnected to the proceedings.  However, if they have legitimate grounds to access the information, it is issued to them.<\/p><p>If an application for court recordings has been granted by the judge, the applicant may have to pay the transcription costs (unless the judge directs otherwise). The payment of the fee for the transcript is typically only levied in civil matters and the cost of producing a transcript of a recording is approximately &euro;200 per hour of audio recording. Where a transcript is already prepared for a criminal trial judge, the party seeking the transcript would not be asked to pay a fee. <\/p><p>The Courts Service does not record the length of time between an application being lodged, the date of the court application and the release of a record of proceedings.

The NPHET reviews international developments as a component of their overall examination of the evolving epidemiology of the COVID-19 and are informed by the international scientific evidence, and guidance by international bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). WHO and ECDC guidance is formulated in the context of considered appraisal of the international experience and accumulating scientific evidence in relation to COVID-19. <\/p><p>The aim of face coverings is to reduce the spread of infection by acting as a source control to stop the spread of infection by the person wearing the covering (including those who do not know they are infected, such as those with no symptoms) or to protect the wearer from droplet splashes or inhaling airborne contaminants including small (aerosol) and large particle droplets. <\/p><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the advice we are giving is that the use of face covering by persons going out in public has been recommended by an increasing number of countries. In Ireland, cloth face coverings are recommended in situations where physical distancing may not be possible, in crowded workplaces, places of worship and in busy or crowded outdoor spaces where there is significant congregation. Face coverings are also mandatory on public transport, including in taxis, as well as in bus and rail stations and in shops and other retail outlets. In restaurants, you should wear a face covering on your way to and from your table.<\/p><p>The wearing of face coverings is also recommended when visiting the homes of those who are over 70 years of age or who are medically vulnerable, by people who are being visited in their homes by those who are over 70 years of age who are medically vulnerable, and if you are travelling in a vehicle with someone you don't live with.  <\/p><p>The relevant regulations in relation to face coverings are outlined below and can be viewed at:- <\/p><p>- Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid19) (Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020 (S.I.

It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Strategy <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19<\/i>, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.<\/p><p>The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.  Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. <\/p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The numbers of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Plan are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is currently at level 3 of the Plan.

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.<\/p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (the NCPE).  They use a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving an application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  When there is a proposed decision by the HSE not to support reimbursement of a medicine, there is an extension in this timeline.  This is due to the requirement of the HSE to issue a &ldquo;notice of proposal&rdquo;, and to allow 28 days for manufacturers to make representations to reconsider their decision. The HSE must then consider those representations and make a formal decision.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible, but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, Ireland joined the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy.

It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600107#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff","counter":811,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600107#WRQ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":812,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[43780\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600107#WRQ01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there will be an increase in pensions for retired nursing staff given that this group have not seen an increase in pension rates in over ten years.","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":813,"content":"<p>The treatment of increases to certain public service pensions is provided for in the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform Circulars 20\/2017, 2\/2018 and 19\/2019.<\/p><p>Under these circulars, a pension increase is applied only in circumstances where the current rate of pay for a serving employee exceeds the pay rate on which the retired staff member&rsquo;s pension is based. <\/p><p>The HSE has been working to ensure that, where increases are due under the circulars, they have been applied at the correct point of pay restoration. <\/p><p>I have requested the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy providing timelines in relation to the processing of pension increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600107#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":814,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600107#WRQ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[43828\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600107#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if consideration has been given towards lifting the restrictions on maternity services throughout Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":816,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the visitor restrictions in our maternity hospitals, which were introduced because of Covid-19, are particularly difficult for expectant women and their partners.

That will provide a clearer picture of the obligations arising under the Convention and the Optional Protocol.  Ireland has recently submitted its first national report, and our appearance before the UN Committee is likely to take place in mid 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the provision of Personal assistance services for people with Disabilities, the Deputy will be aware that the area of disability services is a priority area for this Government. To support people with a disability, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services, and the Government has ensured that an additional &euro;100 million is being provided for new disability measures next year under Budget 2021. These measures will include an additional 80,000 personal assistant hours.  The 2020 national service plan details that the HSE is seeking to deliver 1.67m hours of Personal Assistant Hours to over 2,550 people.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is working to ensure that People with Disabilities be allowed to live an independent life of their own choosing, the same as any other person, and this is consistent with the disability reform policy - &ldquo;transforming lives&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant (PA) services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.<\/p>  <p>  Personal Assistance Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff. Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.<\/p>  <p>  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available. It is important to note that the level of service delivered is varied to ensure that each client&rsquo;s needs are reflected. Therefore there is no average agreed number of PA hours per person. PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.<\/p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, the HSE provides Personal Assistant Services that are person-centred, equitable and transparent to people with a physical and\/or sensory disability. <\/p>  <p>  People with disabilities are now living longer and living with a range of complex needs. In line with national policy implemented under Transforming Lives, the focus in recent years has been to enable people with disabilities to live lives of their choosing. The provision of Personal Assistant hours is an essential component of this.<\/p>  <p>  The PA works on a one to one basis, in the home and the community, with a person with a physical or sensory disability. A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the service user in planning and agreeing the type and the times when support is provided to them. Supporting independent living must enhance the person&rsquo;s control over their own life. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in March 2018 as a process of progressive realisation of the rights that people with disabilities hold under the Convention. Significant progress has been made on key aspects of the CRPD, including enabling most children with disabilties to participate in mainstream education, providing supports for people with disabilities into employment, implementing a policy of decongregation and reforming the law on decision making capacity. <\/p>  <p>  Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that<\/p>  <p>  - disabled people should live where they wish and with whom they wish;<\/p>  <p>  - they should enjoy a range of community support services including personal assistance;<\/p>  <p>  - they should enjoy community life and its opportunities on an equal basis to non-disabled people; and<\/p>  <p>  - they should not be subject to isolation or segregation.<\/p>  <p>  The PA service provided by the HSE adheres to these principles. The Programme for Government, cognisant of these principles, agreed to deliver further increased Personal Assistance hours.<\/p>  <p>  In the normal course of service delivery, an individual's requirements are constantly reviewed to ensure services meet changing need.  An individual&rsquo;s Personal Assistant hours may be adjusted following a service review where demand can result in one individual&rsquo;s hours being reduced in order to address priority needs of other people with disabilities within that community. <\/p>  <p>  This much needed flexibility gives local Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) the freedom to target Personal Assistant hours to maximum effect within their area. <\/p>  <p>  Beyond the clear policy and operational arrangements, which I have outlined, and which facilitate the availability of appropriate and growing levels of Personal Assistant support, I have no plans for additional legislation governing the rights, entitlements and operations associated with this service at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600107#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental

Samples are taken by healthcare professionals in healthcare settings, community test centres, workplaces or in the patient&rsquo;s home.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to conduct the type of testing the Deputy describes. It should be noted that testing for Covid-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason, for example, that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person. <\/p>  <p>  I have been informed that Covid-19 testing has recently been offered at a third level institution. This was done in response to an ongoing outbreak in the student population there. A Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) was undertaken, and it was recommended to provide an opportunity for students to self-refer for Covid-19 testing. The decision to provide a similar testing facility at any other third-level educational institutes would be based on the undertaking of an appropriate risk assessment. The risk assessment applied in educational settings may be dynamic and change as new information becomes available, and the testing strategy may evolve as information unfolds. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is pursuing a robust testing strategy under the guidance of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. <\/p>  <p>  The testing strategy in use in Ireland remains under consideration by NPHET on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[43962\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if disability functions will be transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; and if so, the timeline for same.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":882,"content":"<p>Following the Government's announcement in June regarding the establishment of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability and Integration, arrangements are underway for the transfer of disability services to the new Department.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of factors to be taken into consideration in planning for this transfer of functions.

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.<\/p>  <p>  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.<\/p>  <p>  The functions and powers of the Chief Inspector are set out in Parts 7, 8 and 9 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended).  The Statutory powers include the cancellation of registration under section 51 of the Act and the urgent action under section 59 of the Act to attach, vary or remove a condition of registration or cancellation of registration.  <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, the primary responsibility for the provision of safe care and service to nursing home residents rests with individual nursing home operators.  If the Chief Inspector cancels a registration under section 51 and the cancellation takes effect, or if the Chief Inspector obtains an order to cancel a registration in accordance to section 59 and the cancellation takes effect then under section 64 of the Act the Chief Inspector notifies the HSE of the cancellation of the registration and of the date on which this takes effect.  The HSE must make alternative arrangements, as soon as practicable for residents where registration has been cancelled and closure orders have been secured by HIQA.  Pending these alternative arrangements, the HSE, either with the consent of the registered provider or by order of the District Court shall take the charge of the designated centre. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that HIQA would usually ensure that the HSE is aware of the proposed cancellation of a service, noting that the HSE may be required to take over operation of the designated centre.

In both cases, there was a serious risk to the health or welfare of persons resident in the nursing home because of an act, failure to act or negligence on the part of the provider. Applications for cancellation were made to the District Court under section 59 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended) . The District Court granted the cancellation of registration under section 59 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended)  and the Chief Inspector notified the HSE to assume responsibility of the nursing home under section 64 of the act.  <\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to any nursing homes it took operational responsibility for outside of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR03900"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[43993\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to have an orderly resumption of day services for persons with a disability in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>All day service locations with the exception of those being utilised as COVID-19 Isolation or testing centres have reopened since August. <\/p><p>There are currently 7 day service locations nationally that are being used for COVID-19 isolation or testing centres: one in CHO1; two in CHO2; one in CHO3 and three in CHO9. <\/p><p>Service users that usually received their supports from these locations are now either receiving supports at another location or receiving outreach or home-based supports.

All of the recommended vaccines used in Ireland are licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority. They are licensed for use only when they have been shown to be both safe and effective.<\/p><p>  Due to the urgency posed by the pandemic, unprecedented efforts are ongoing to develop COVID-19 vaccines and make them available as soon as possible. Unprecedented levels of scientific research and collaboration, investment and early and proactive engagement between vaccine developers and regulators has helped speed up development and ensured that quality, safety and effectiveness are not compromised.<\/p><p>  Vaccines are a proven, cost-effective intervention to protect public health; second only to the provision of clean water. Worldwide, they save at least 2-3 million lives each year &ndash; and many more from crippling and lifelong illnesses.<\/p><p>  Certain priority groups will be vaccinated first. For example, frontline healthcare workers and people who are most at risk from serious infection if they catch COVID-19. Once these priority groups have been vaccinated, the vaccine will be available to the rest of the population.<\/p><p>  While a vaccine is to be welcomed, no vaccine is a silver bullet.

The first is preparing for the vaccine, emphasising the safety and regulatory processes that are taking place in Ireland, Europe and across the world, engaging with people who have genuine hesitancies around the vaccine and communicating the Government Plan from acquisition to prioritisation to distribution. <\/p><p>  The second objective will focus on the implementation  of the vaccine programme &ndash; encouraging the public to get the vaccine, informing who will administer it and where, identifying people of trust to act as ambassadors for the vaccine. <\/p><p>  The communications strategy will build on the public trust the ongoing COVID-19 communications campaign has generated through open and transparent communication led by experts, ongoing understanding of public sentiment, clear and consistent communication to empower the public and collaboration between my Department, the HSE and the HPRA.<\/p><p>  Key learning from the recent HPV campaign shows the importance of listening to the public, acknowledging and addressing their fears, delivering clinical advice with empathy and ensuring that the vaccine is logistically and financially easy to access. <\/p><p>  Understanding, reacting and responding to public sentiment had been a core element of the COVID-19 and HPV campaign to date through a weekly quantitative Tracker for my Department, prepared by Amar&aacute;ch, a fortnightly qualitative tracker utilising focus groups and in depth interviews and the work of the Behavioural Research Advisory Group.<\/p><p>  Active expert participants in the campaign will come from my Department,  the HPRA, and the HSE, ensuring clear and consistent communications from a trusted source, while the messaging will move from the yellow &lsquo;alert of the COVID-19 campaign, to a blue for hope and control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":914,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR05400"},{"type":"question","counter":915,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[44007\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the orthopaedic clinic in St. Vincent's University Hospital is open; if not, when it will resume; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":916,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600108#WRR05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":918,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600109#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":919,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[44008\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121600109#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on indemnity cover for Covid-19 vaccines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":920,"content":"<p>Ireland is currently involved in an EU Procurement Exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure a portfolio of suitable, safe and effective vaccines, in sufficient quantities, to combat COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the exercise, Ireland has already opted into an Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with AstraZeneca (partnering with Oxford University); Janssen (Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson); BioNTech \/ Pfizer; CureVac and Moderna.<\/p>  <p>  The content of the Advance Purchase Agreements, including with regard to liability \/ indemnity, are negotiated with vaccine suppliers by the European Commission and its negotiation team acting on behalf of Member States.
