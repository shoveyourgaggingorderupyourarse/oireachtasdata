We will hold all of it together for a separate discussion and deal with the other correspondence received first, but I want to give members an indication of the volume of material that has been sent to the committee as a result of our questioning at a previous meeting.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 1943A and 1958 are items of correspondence received from Mr. Peter McCarthy, CEO of Enet, providing briefing material and an opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The second category is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers as a follow-up to requests made at Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  <\/p> <p>  No. 1932B is a letter received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee on the Government banking service contract in respect of the service being provided by Danske Bank.  Mr. Watt does not provide specific details, but he mentions the fact that there are up to 50 million transactions, mainly involving the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which accounts for some 43 million of them.  Mr. Watt says the service delivery and relationship management aspects of the contract are primarily managed by Danske Bank's Dublin based team supported by the head office in Copenhagen in Denmark.  It had a pre-existing arrangement with An Post for cash and cheque transactions, etc.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1937B is correspondence received from Dr. Des Fitzgerald in the University of Limerick, providing information requested by the committee.  We asked for the total number of subsidiary companies; a breakdown of the staff and the board membership, as well as the most recent financial statements for Plassey Campus Centre.  All of the information is provided, with a list of all the companies over which it has control and the financial statements for Plassey Campus Centre, a company limited by guarantee, formerly known as Plassey Campus Centre Limited.  I note that the company which is controlled by the University of Limerick has a turnover of &euro;37.168 million and revenue reserves of &euro;36.273 million.

Ms Sinnamon confirms that Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;1.59 million in the project and received &euro;4.5 million from the proceeds of the sale.

There has been much debate about returns to the State.  It is clear that on an investment of &euro;1.59 million by Enterprise Ireland, it received &euro;4.5 million in return.  That helps to complete the picture on the matter.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1939B, correspondence received in connection with the national children's hospital.  As we have a large volume of items in that regard, we will note and discuss the correspondence with all of the other correspondence received on the national children's hospital.  No. 1940B is also correspondence related to the national children's hospital.<\/p> <p>  No. 1942B is correspondence, dated 7 February 2019, received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing follow-up information requested by the committee at an earlier meeting.  What is provided includes information requested from the Irish Prison Service.  There are three items outstanding which the secretariat will be monitoring.  I will make a brief observation and know that other members wish to comment.  There has been much public criticism of us by another Oireachtas committee asking these questions, but I wish to put in context the reasons we are asking them.  There is a complication as the issues are within the remit of the justice committee, but equally they are within the remit of this committee.  Some committees of the Houses believe that if a matter is within their remit, it cannot come within ours, but there are matters that fall within the remit of more than one committee.  We must deal with that issue.  If a topic falls within the remit of a line committee, it should not necessarily be excluded from the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will not get into the detail as I know members wish to comment on the issue.<\/p> <p>  We followed up with the State Claims Agency on the matter of medical negligence and the cost of claims against the State.  There are approximately 1,685 such claims against the Irish Prison Service from current and former prisoners which may bring a serious cost to the State.  We were acting within our remit in inquiring about the background and matters such as how prisoners were dealt with while imprisoned.  There are also concerns about potential medical claims, which is why we asked about the medical service.  We asked about the level of prisoner injury and compensation claims.  The reply from the Department of Justice and Equality is that the information is awaited from the State Claims Agency.  The fact that the agency is dealing with the matter is proof that it is very much one within our remit.  We also asked about cases being taken against the State on the issue I mentioned.  That request is with the State Claims Agency.  We asked for details of compensation paid in cases where prisoners had harmed themselves.  Again, the Department is awaiting information from the agency.  We asked for information on compensation payments related to protected disclosures.  Again, information is awaited from the agency.<\/p> <p>  We were concerned about the health of prisoners as if the State was not providing adequate medical services, it might well lead to compensation claims against it.  We want such matters to be dealt with.  I was shocked by the response to one of the questions asked.  We asked about the number of prisoners with mental health or drug dependency issues, including the percentage of prisoners who passed through the system every year on medication or prescriptions.  The reply states: \"Information on the level of mental health conditions in the prison population is derived from studies done in 2003 and 2005\".  If information is based on 15 year old studies, it is utterly unacceptable and possibly on the negligent side of things.  That is if this is the most up-to-date information available.  The reply also states the rate of prescribing in the Irish Prison Service is \"currently\" - the letter dates from last week - 63% of the total number of prisoners in custody.  They have an active prescription which indicates that serious issues may arise at a later date.  The reply gives the cost of maintaining a prisoner in a high security prison, a medium security prison and an open prison.  The average cost was &euro;68,535 in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>There is much detail included in the correspondence.  As a committee, we requested a number of pieces of information.  The correspondence indicates that there are three elements that will be responded to at a later date, but as there may be more, we might liaise with the clerk on the outstanding requests.<\/p><p>The first point made in the reply is related to surveillance and is mind-boggling because of the way it is written.  One has to read it two or three times in order to understand it.  It states: &quot;In relation to the request by the committee for an information note on any costs for surveillance in any of the prisons or any prison offices over the past five years, the Irish Prison Service has no information to suggest that any authorised covert surveillance of a prison officer has been undertaken by the Irish Prison Service&quot;.  That relates to authorised, not unauthorised, activity.  The reply continues:<\/p><blockquote>Companies were engaged by the Irish Prison Service operational support group.  Records show that one company was paid a cumulative total of &euro;9,586.59 in 2011 and &euro;8,641.68 in 2012.  A second company was paid a cumulative total of &euro;10,774.12 in 2011.  It is not possible from the information available to determine if these payments relate to the surveillance of prison staff.<\/blockquote> <p>Effectively, the Irish Prison Service does not know why the money was paid.  The executive summary states money has been spent, but the service has no idea why it was spent.  It is mind-boggling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#C00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>It is a comprehensive set of documentation, on which I agree with most of the Chairman's observations.

In general, if I may explain how a framework agreement works, the Office of Government Procurement or a large organisation puts a framework agreement in place.  They look for contractors who are capable of providing a class of service.  They pre-qualify them and put them on this framework arrangement.  Normally, when an organisation then wants to avail of the framework, it will go to a number of the contractors and run what is called a mini-competition.  It will state specifically what it needs and ask for prices, running a constrained competition.  Some people refer to a framework agreement when what they mean is a draw-down contract, whereby there is an arrangement for a certain amount of service to be provided but where more of the service can be drawn down.

Next is correspondence No. 1949B from Martin Whelan, head of public affairs at the National Treasury Management Agency, providing a note on the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is part of the NTMA, and its investment in the Irish infrastructure fund, IIF, which, although it sounds similar, is a completely different organisation.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is part of the State under the NTMA.  The second last paragraph of the letter states that one of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's investments is in a privately managed Irish infrastructure fund.  While the abbreviations are similar, they are distinct and different entities.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is a State-owned fund and the IIF is a privately managed fund.  There is a bit of confusion about the names out there.  Investors in the privately managed IIF purchase their investment via unit holdings.  This is common practice in fund-based investments.  Consequently, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund does not own shares or have a shareholding in the privately managed IIF but does have a commercial interest via unit holdings.  The letter further states that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund holds 49.5% of the units in the privately managed IIF and has a commitment of &euro;250 million to the privately managed fund.  A chart is provided showing that there are 27 investors in the IIF who have control of 50.5%, while the State involvement is 49.5%.

There is a push in a particular direction.  For example, I would immediately think of climate change.  Some infrastructure projects may make us more vulnerable to climate change.

When a board spends more than &euro;25,000 it is supposed to put the contract on eTenders but because this organisation has devolved procurement to different areas, individual schools or training centres were making purchases from the same supplier.  These were in areas such as school books, arts and crafts material, coach hire, document storage, disability service providers, merchant banking services, school food provision and managed print services.  These contracts should be available to anybody who can supply them.<\/p> <p>  In another area, there were purchases of goods and services where the tender was extended beyond the specified contract period, for which the total cost incurred in 2017 was approximately &euro;1 million.

One can clearly see that we will hold to account the boards of the education and training boards or whatever the organisations are.  As we did in the case of the non-provision of accounts in a timely manner, we might end up having to bring four or five organisations before the committee, which will send out a clear message.

That was fairly substantial.  There are a number of issues and, in some cases, it is a matter of small organisations not having the expertise or capacity.  Some of the explanations are benign while others are not, and some of the issues cost the State money while others do not.  The one constant is a note in the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit opinion but, as far as I can see, there is no sanction for organisations that do not comply with the rules.

It looks particularly at the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and specifically the reporting obligations of directors of State bodies.  I draw attention to the legal basis of State bodies.  The point I made was that most of them were set up under statute - either specific Acts or statutory instruments.  However, in some cases State bodies are set up as companies under the provisions of the Companies Act.  If they are set up as companies, they must observe all the requirements of the Companies Act.  In addition, there may be requirements, in terms of reporting and so on, imposed by the line Minister or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  It is probably worth bearing in mind that the legal basis for a State body is not synonymous with the depiction or the designation of the body as commercial or non-commercial.  For example, Pobal is established as a company, but is classified as a non-commercial State body, while the ESB is established under an Act of 1927, but is classified as a commercial State body.  There is a bit of greyness around what applies in the code of practice because of those differences in designation.<\/p> <p>  The code of practice deals with fiduciary duty obligations on board members in general terms, but the terminology used relates to the interest of a company.  So there is a bit of ambiguity there as to whether the same principle should apply to any public body.  The specific bullet points that are included in the code are lifted more or less from the Companies Act.  It would seem to suggest that is specific to State companies as opposed to bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#H01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>To clarify, it is possible to have a State company that is a company and a State body that is just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#H01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550134800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>That is not a company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#H01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>There is a big distinction between the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#H01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550134800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Yes.

This requires the Minister to be notified without delay where: there are serious weaknesses in controls that have not been addressed despite being drawn to the attention of the board or the chairperson; there is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body that is not being addressed; or there are serious concerns about possible illegality or fraud occurring in a State body.

At the previous meeting, I asked who was protecting the public purse and various colleagues, notably Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, took up the issue, which was very helpful.  The chairperson of the board did not seem to know who on the board was protecting the public purse or representing the ordinary person.  It subsequently emerged from, I think, the Department of Health that the gentleman who was named was the nominee on the board but that was not clear.  I cannot remember what answer was given about his reporting duties.  The circular has provided some clarification that has particular significance for this board.  It also has a wider significance in terms of appointments to various boards generally and who protecting the public purse and acts as the voice for the public.  There is the specific issue of the hospital board and then generally.  This is just the beginning in clarifying where accountability lies.  The 2010 circular, which was issued eight years ago, refers to contributing to greater accountability in non-commercial State bodies.  Everything set out in the circular was good but it did not happen.  That is my comment on the matter.

My issue is that we had the Secretary General of the Department before us on this issue.  We were dealing specifically with the processes and procedures around procurement and the spend of taxpayers' money in respect of the national children's hospital.  We had to drag information out of the Department in respect of the cost overruns.  From the &euro;983 million to the &euro;1.4 billion to the &euro;1.7 billion, we spent the entire morning getting that information.  We eventually got a breakdown, which we should have had before the meeting started.  How in God's name did the Department not give us the Mazars report in advance of those witnesses coming in?  To be fair to Mazars, its report nails many of the issues.  It is a very good report.  It outlines the 57% increase in costs as soon as the project started.  In my view it is a damning indictment of the work of the design team and the implementation board.  It is a damning indictment of the reporting relationship between the board and the Department.  There was very poor oversight.  We talk about reporting lines in respect of civil servants sitting on boards.  The reporting lines between the board and the Department were very weak.<\/p> <p>  What we have now established from our work in the Committee of Public Accounts is that in April of 2018 the steering committee became aware of very significant cost overruns.  The Department was not informed until August and the Cabinet and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was not informed until November.  That is where we ended up but my point is that the Mazars report highlighted all of these weaknesses yet we were not given that report before the witnesses came in.  We were given it afterwards.  I believe that was disingenuous of the Department not to do that.  We had to go looking for that and when we got it, we saw that it answers many of the questions we would have wanted to put to them.  In my opinion it is a way of avoiding accountability because a report such as this one is done for a reason.  It is to identify where weaknesses exist and our job is to probe those weaknesses to seek improvements.  We are not here to do anything other than protect the taxpayer, make sure that if there are weaknesses in the system we can identify and highlight them and recommend changes and improvements.  That is our purpose.  We cannot do that if valuable and important documentation is not provided.  I cannot understand why that report was not given to us.  We got it on Monday with a mountain of other documentation that it is not possible for any member of this committee to go through.  I made the David and Goliath comparison earlier.  We are not the Goliath, and some people have their views about the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are doing a very difficult job with the mountains of correspondence that we get, and we cannot keep up with all of it.  I believe in this case it was a deliberate tactic by the Department not to give us that report because I think it would have been a very different meeting.  That is my point.

We had a preliminary discussion with the Department on it and we felt we could do with a broader understanding of the broadband issue, if the witnesses will pardon the pun.

I am director of wholesale for BT Ireland, and I am joined by my colleague, John O'Dwyer, head of regulation at BT Ireland.<\/p> <p>  BT is the main alternative provider of fixed line communications services in Ireland, employing more than 650 professionals throughout the country.  With a global network in 198 countries, our expertise lies in building and managing complex communications solutions for multinationals, public sector organisations and large domestic businesses.  We are Europe&rsquo;s largest telecoms services wholesaler by revenue and market share, serving more than 50 Irish communication providers, including Sky Ireland and Three.  We have invested heavily in building a high-capacity fibre network with nationwide reach, supported by sophisticated IT platforms and an expert in-house team.  We are in our 20th year of organising the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, Ireland&rsquo;s flagship science and technology platform for primary and secondary school students. <\/p> <p>  Our formal involvement to date with the national broadband plan, NBP, has been relatively limited so I will comment briefly on this before focusing primarily on our perspective on the opportunity presented by the metropolitan area networks, MANs, to improve broadband service provision throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the national broadband plan, as mentioned, BT Ireland provides national and international business, IT and communications services to corporate and public sector customers, alongside wholesale voice and broadband services to fixed and mobile telecommunications companies.  We considered entering the NBP bid process to roll out broadband access but we found that our business was better aligned with providing wholesale backhaul facilities and connectivity to service providers.  BT Ireland, therefore, offered to be a subcontractor to the Gigabit Fibre bid, which ultimately did not proceed past the pre-qualification questionnaire stage.  BT Ireland considers that high-speed connectivity to every home and business is an essential goal for Ireland, and one we actively support.<\/p> <p>  The metropolitan area networks were established using EU state aid to overcome limitations in the supply of fibre for entrant operators to invest into 94 provincial towns, such as Tralee, Wexford and Sligo.  The conditions of state aid approval sought to ensure that the MANs achieved the aim of stimulating investment and competition in regional areas on an open and transparent basis for all users of the MANs, for example, network operators such as ourselves which provide services directly or indirectly to homes and businesses.  We believe there is a considerable opportunity for some relatively straightforward enhancements to how the MANs are operated and monitored today.  Such enhancements could include the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment requesting the support of ComReg in the governance of the contractual obligations of the MANs managed services entity, MSE.  In doing so, we believe it is possible to ensure that its original purpose - equitable, open and transparent operation for all operators - is preserved, and will encourage further investment for more consumer-friendly solutions to homes and business throughout these provincial regions.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to speak to the committee.  My colleague and I would be happy to provide the committee with further information or to support it with any query members might have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Evans"},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Evans for his presentation.

We were concerned that the pricing, the levels of pricing and the discounting were not as transparent as we believed necessary in a public contract such as that for MANs.  We also believed that, in managing that contract, the Department would benefit from bringing in ComReg.  ComReg is the expert in telecommunications in Ireland and the expert regulator.  It understands cost models, pricing and competition.  We sought the bringing in of ComReg to provide a level of governance on that contract not only now, but on an ongoing basis.  We had a number of other concerns around the operation of the managed services entity.  Does the managed services entity own and run the MANs or is it a telecommunications operator itself?  The EU state aid rules make it very clear that it was not to be an operator, but it clearly is an operator today.  We believe that necessitated a level of separation between the company that manages the MANs and the company that runs the commercial organisation.  Some of that level of transparency between the two organisations is addressed in the Analysys Mason report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Evans"},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Irrespective of which company was running the MANs contract, if it had a wholesale element and a retail element they would have to be clearly separated.

That discussion in the UK is happening as we speak.  There is a debate.  The universal service is looking at 10 Gbps, which is lower than is being required here, although in practice a lot of the technologies would give one 30 Gbps or above anyway.  It is going down the road of this universal service approach to it.  One of the things which may be quite useful here is that BT has put forward a proposal in the UK to pragmatically look at the remainder.  One of the things that has happened is it has looked at introducing this from 2020.  It is saying that in 2020 it thinks it will be short of meeting the 100% coverage by approximately 600,000 premises - very similar to the numbers here, to be honest.  It thinks it will be short by that amount.<\/p> <p>  What BT, our parent company, has done is make a proposal.  It is in the public domain and is on the Ofcom website.  It has made a proposal, which is being discussed with the regulator as part of consultations, etc.  It has looked at it pragmatically.  It has said it is a lot of customers and has asked how it can do this quickly and pragmatically.  It said, \"Well, let us look at radio.\".  It has asked if 4G or 5G can help, because that can be rolled out very quickly and it has already got a lot of coverage, could work.   It reckons it could cover approximately 450,000 of that 600,000 with radio technology, like 4G and 5G.  EE, the company we also own, runs very good 4G.  It reckons it could get on average approximately 30 Mbps downstream, which, actually, is the specification for the NBP download speeds.<\/p> <p>  It said, \"Well, okay, that is the first 450,000.  Let us look at the next piece of it.  We are 150,000 short.\"  It asked what it could do now and it set a threshold.\"  It is &pound;3,200, or something of that order.  It asked what it could do within that.  In terms of a price range of &pound;3,200, it could pay for itself.  It said that it could probably do 40,000 and pay that itself commercially without too much of a hit and that it would recover that eventually.  It would then be down to 110,000.  At the moment, there is a discussion - it may not be arguing but debating - how do one deals with the 110,000.  It has taken a very pragmatic approach of chunking it to see what it can do rather than saying that it is just a big number, it is a big problem, let us break the problem down and see how we can split it up.

There was some debate at the time as to whether it was the correct sort of investment for state aid.  The European Commission issued a document, which is quite easy to obtain via Google, providing a set of conditions for that state aid.  In the concession agreement and the operation of the MANs, in my opinion, they have to comply with those conditions set as part of the state aid approval.

We are happy to be here and hope that we can help with the information on the telecommunications industry and market in Ireland.  I will begin by addressing Eir's current investment strategy, which is underpinned by strong support from our new shareholders, NJJ.  We are focused on further network expansion of both mobile and fixed services and plan to spend &euro;1 billion over the next five years.  That is on top of the &euro;1.5 billion that we have already spent, making Eir the largest investor in telecommunications infrastructure in Ireland in the last five years.  The European Commission states that Eir's &euro;1.5 billion investment moved Ireland from a position where 30% of the population had access to high-speed broadband to 90% today.  Earlier this week, we announced a &euro;500 million investment over five years to expand our fibre-to-the-home network, FTTH, beyond rural Ireland to a further 1.4 million premises.  That will cover 180 towns and cities.  When this project is complete, 75% of premises in Ireland will have access to fibre-to-the-home technology, which will move Ireland to third place in Europe for fibre to the home roll-out.  Every town in Ireland with 1,000 premises will be included in this roll-out.  Eir also contributes more than &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy annually.<\/p> <p>  In our material submitted to the committee and our discussions today, we are conscious of the ongoing national broadband plan process and our own engagement with the one remaining bidder, as a likely subcontractor to National Broadband Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to attend the committee and to be as helpful as possible.  However, there may be some specific questions about the process of the draft contract which we may not be able to discuss.<\/p> <p>  Eir's rural fibre investment, to pass over 300,000 premises, has attracted much public and political commentary and criticism.  When the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment approached all the network providers, we were asked to provide any future investment plans we had in the intervention area.  We faced a decision at Eir.  We were fast approaching the end of our fibre-to-the-cabinet investment programme, which brought high-speed broadband to 1.6 million homes and businesses in suburban and urban areas.  We put together a team of engineers, planners and contractors, to prove that we could roll out fibre quickly, efficiently and on budget.<\/p><p>We had to decide whether to dismantle that team and wait for the national broadband plan, NBP, process to conclude and possibly rebuild the team at that point or to keep that team moving forward and continue our fibre investment into the remaining commercially viable areas.  We knew we had a commercial business case for roll-out to another 300,000 homes in rural Ireland.  Eir decided to continue fibre investment into rural Ireland.  The specific 300,575 premises - identified by Eircode - were selected based on a number of criteria but essentially to provide the greatest number of premises which were commercially feasible that we could deliver within our &euro;250 million budget.  We needed to stay within that budget and we needed to see how many homes we could get passed for &euro;250 million.<\/p><p> In April 2017 we entered into a formal commitment agreement with the Department - at its request - and we shared with the Department an indicative deployment timeline.  I am pleased to say that as of last month, the programme is 76% complete and more than 228,000 of the specific 300,000 were passed.  We have also passed an additional 30,000 rural premises.  People refer to the 300,000 premises but these are not just statistics: 800 people have laid 22,000 km of fibre across the State from Drumcliff in Sligo to Rathmoylan in Waterford.  When we are completed in June this year, some 900,000 people in rural Ireland will have access to high-speed fibre broadband, as will 30,000 farms, more than 1,000 schools, 300 business parks and 50,000 small businesses.<\/p><p> Our rural fibre programme is an investment of &euro;250 million by Eir shareholders, connecting rural communities with high-speed future-proof technology.  We believe this is the single largest investment in fixed fibre technology in rural Ireland and is unmatched in scale and scope by any other operator.  I reiterate that our rural fibre to the home investment is Eir's own private capital.  It is not subsidised in any way by the Government.  Consequently, by June of this year more than 335,000 homes and businesses that originally required a subsidy under the national broadband plan will be able to avail of high-speed broadband without any contribution from the taxpayer.<\/p><p> As for the national broadband plan, as Eir began the rural 300,000 deployment we also remained a bidder in the national broadband plan and committed to securing the contract to deploy high-speed broadband to the remaining premises within the intervention areas.  We entered the national broadband plan process with only one goal, which was to win the NBP.  We invested more than &euro;7 million on our bid.  On 26 September 2017, we responded to the Department's invitation to submit a detailed submission, known as an invitation to submit detailed solutions, ISDS.  This included more than 3,000 pages of information, maps contained in 35 memory sticks and 52 lever arch files.  We actually had to make a wooden box to contain the submission.  The Department was aware that at that time, Eir had a range of commercial, regulatory and governance concerns about elements emerging in the procurement process.  We had raised these issues in August 2016 so the Department was well aware of our challenges.  We had decided, however, to remain in the process.  Even though there were three bidders remaining at that stage we were only one of two who submitted an ISDS.  It was a lot of work to put that ISDS together and submitting it.<\/p><p> In January 2018 my predecessor, Richard Moat, met the then Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten and the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Mark Griffin, to inform them of Eir&rsquo;s decision to regrettably withdraw from the bid process for the national broadband plan contract.  We confirmed this in writing on 30 January 2018.  Following protracted discussions we ultimately we came to the conclusion that the NBP framework would drive very substantial additional costs and delays to the roll-out of high-speed broadband to rural Ireland.  In our view the NBP framework resulted in duplication and inefficiency, adding to the ultimate cost to deliver high-speed broadband to non-commercial areas of rural Ireland.  We could not, therefore, accept it and we could not recommend it to our board.<\/p><p> There were specific requirements, such as ring fencing of funding, the creation of a wholly separate subsidiary company and the proposed restrictions on our existing wholesale division&rsquo;s ability to compete in the NBP areas.  These were all critical factors in our ultimate decision, as was the knock-on effect of NBP pricing and other decisions on our business outside of the intervention footprint.  This was a big consideration for Eir.<\/p><p> These challenges were unique to us because Eir is the only operator with an extensive wholesale division.  It was also looking as though Eir's infrastructure was the most likely to be built on.  There were processes and aspects that applied to Eir that did not apply to other bidders.<\/p><p> The committee has asked that we also refer to any other details we had on the metropolitan area networks, MANs.  The MANs did not form any part of our bid for NBP.  As we have a network everywhere there is a MAN, we do not use the MANs.  We did not have any communication with the Department on the MANs.  We had, however, been awaiting the launch of a re-tender of the MANs contracts and we expected to see it out in the summer of 2019.  We had planned to tender because, as I said, we have infrastructure everywhere there is a MAN and we thought there would be synergies there so we could probably put in a good bid that would save some taxpayer money.<\/p><p> The committee also asked for information on our mobile and 5G investments.  Recently we began a &euro;150 million mobile network upgrade and expansion.  This will grow our network by 25% with over 200 sites.  It will expand our 4G coverage to 99% population and geographical coverage.<\/p><p>It will also allow us to trial 5G later this year and to trial fixed wireless access as another potential mobile solution to rural broadband coverage.<\/p><p>  It remains a source of real regret for Eir, and for me personally because I was the managing director of Open Eir, which was heavily involved in putting together the NBP bid, that we ultimately found ourselves in a position where we could no longer remain in the NBP bid process.  I worked very closely on the process with a dedicated team of employees.  It was not a decision we took lightly.  We continue to engage extensively with the remaining bidder and we continue to support the Department in rolling out the NBP.<\/p><p> I am happy to take any questions that the members may have and will endeavour to be as helpful as possible, conscious of our obligations in respect of the communications protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#T02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lennon for her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019021400002#U00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1550134800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I wish the witnesses a good afternoon and apologise for the delay.
