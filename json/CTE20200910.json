I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Mary Dunnion, chief inspector of social services and director of regulation, and Ms Susan Cliffe, deputy chief inspector of social services.<\/p> <p>  In July, HIQA published a report on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on nursing homes in Ireland.  The report details the initial findings of our inspections and interactions with nursing homes and describes the experiences of residents, their relatives and staff.  The report outlines the significant level of activity that has occurred from March to the date of publication in July to ensure the safety and welfare of residents and to support service providers and staff.<\/p><p>This includes, for example, inspections of centres both with and without cases of Covid-19, the expedition of applications to open new nursing home beds, the receipt and review of a large number of mandatory notifications, and the opening of HIQA&rsquo;s infection prevention and control hub.  <\/p><p> Since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in an Irish nursing home on 13 March, HIQA has maintained regular and ongoing contact with the providers and managers of nursing homes and monitored their ability to protect residents and manage an outbreak of this nature.  These facilities faced substantial challenges in the initial phase of the pandemic for the following reasons: they are not hospitals - good nursing homes provide a social model of care and are integrated into their local communities; the prevalence of Covid-19 in the community; initial limitations in accessing Covid-19 testing and prompt notification of results; limited working knowledge initially of the symptoms of Covid-19 and the extent of asymptomatic spread; the absence in some facilities of comprehensive plans to deal with the outbreaks; challenges in replacing staff due to the requirement for quarantine and self-isolation; the scarcity of personal protective equipment, PPE, across the health sector; infection prevention and control processes that were not commensurate with what would be required to effectively manage a pandemic; the need to understand and apply frequently changing national guidance on the management of Covid-19; and the fact that 80% of nursing homes are privately managed with minimal formal referral pathways to the HSE.<\/p><p> A key element of our inspections is listening to the views of people who live in nursing homes.  On more recent inspections, residents who spoke to our inspectors expressed a range of emotions.  Some feared contracting the virus and worried about their family and friends, while others felt a deep sense of isolation and loneliness as a result of the visiting restrictions.  Without exception, residents were deeply grateful to staff in nursing homes for the care they provided in extremely challenging circumstances.<\/p><p> In the context of HIQA's role, Covid-19 has brought into sharp focus the need to immediately review and enhance the current regulatory framework.  In the long term, a reform of established models of care for older people in Ireland is required.  To this end, on 25 June, HIQA submitted to the Minister for Health a number of suggested interim amendments to the Health Act 2007 and the regulations for designated centres for older people, and adults and children with a disability.  <\/p><p> HIQA contributed to the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel report published on 19 August by the Minister for Health.  This report contains a range of recommendations aimed at safeguarding residents in nursing homes.  The report makes 86 recommendations, 24 of which are directly relevant to our role.  HIQA has been identified as the lead agency in four recommendations, and is one of a number of agencies that will contribute to the implementation of a further 20 recommendations.  A large number of recommendations require urgent implementation and-or planning for implementation to commence immediately.  This is to maintain the focus on supporting nursing home residents, ensuring that older people, especially those at high risk of infection, are at the centre of the ongoing response to Covid-19.  <\/p><p> Some of the recommendations involve enhancements to our current regulatory practice and schedule, such as an increase in the volume and frequency of on-site inspection activity to at least one inspection per centre per year and targeted Covid-19 preparedness inspections.  <\/p><p> In addition, these recommendations will require the implementation of additional regulations and legislation or the amendment of current regulations; the identification of a suite of quality assurance metrics and mandatory notifications; the establishment of a number of new registers; publication of the results of specific audits; and an increase in HIQA's capacity, including our ICT resources.  In addition, there is also a wide range of measures and actions to be undertaken that are the responsibility of individual nursing home providers.<\/p><p> I also acknowledge the publication of this committee&rsquo;s interim report on Covid-19 in nursing homes.  We agree with the statement made therein that the crisis has highlighted the need to move to a different model of care where older people are cared for in their own homes or their communities for as long as possible.  We welcome the recommendations made in the report and are working with the Department of Health to ensure that HIQA has adequate resources to progress both these recommendations and those of the expert panel.  A business case has been made to the Department of Health in this regard.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its attention this morning.  We look forward to answering any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020091000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599692400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn very much.

In one sense, HIQA is saying these issues are jumping out at us, such as the largely privatised nature of our nursing home sector and the care of our elderly being the subject of profits for lots of companies.  However, at no stage does the report point to that as a problem.  One of the starkest figures in everything I have come across is that 56% of all deaths during Covid took place in nursing homes while that setting represents only 0.65% of the total living population.  This alarming figure and the lack of pointing the finger at what has gone on means that we do need a public inquiry into everything that happened.  I have been adamant that I want that inquiry to take place into all the deaths and all the decisions taken in each case, particularly not to move residents to acute hospital settings.  In that light, I want to mention the grandmother of Florence O'Shaughnessy, who has written to us all.

That also happens to be the date it was first notified of a death from Covid in nursing homes.  It was said earlier by Ms Dunnion that everybody was learning about this pandemic and how we should handle it.  HIQA seems to have learned very quickly, on the same date that it got notification of a death, that that was the date not to go in and inspect nursing homes anymore.<\/p><p>If my understanding is correct, there were no inspections or monitoring taking place in March, April or May.  Looking at the graph showing unexpected deaths in nursing homes, it is clear how they spiked out of all control during that period.  It was startling and we are all aware of it through the news media reports and so on.  Why did HIQA take such a sudden, rapid decision to end all monitoring inspections of nursing homes on the first day it heard of a death in a nursing home?  That was inadequate and inappropriate.  Inspectors could have gone in dressed in PPE, or space suits if necessary.  We expected staff and others to go in and carry out their jobs with little or no PPE and with instructions that they should not wear masks until they were symptomatic.  We did not have the oversight of a body that the State depends on to ensure that everything was being done in a correct way.  The fact remains that those inspections did not take place and we now have hundreds of families left in distress, wanting to know exactly what happened to their loved ones.  They know they died but they do not know in what circumstances.  They do not know what was given to them for pain or distress relief.  They do not know whether they could have been transferred to a hospital.  We paid millions of euro for capacity in private hospitals, which were largely left empty during the pandemic, but we do not seem to have taken the care to shift elderly people to a hospital setting where they could at least have died with more dignity, less pain and less distress.  All of that needs to be investigated.  Since I am not allowed mention names or families, it takes from the strength of the evidence I wanted to give to try to raise the alarm with HIQA, the public and the Government that we absolutely need a public inquiry.<\/p><p> The second issue I would like the witnesses to comment on is the critique of the privatisation of the nursing homes sector.  HIQA states in its report that the issues relating to Covid in the private nursing homes sector throws into sharp relief the lessons we have to learn and the impact on nursing homes.  It states that this exposes a fundamental weakness in privatisation of the nursing homes but at no stage does HIQA draw conclusions from that.  The second conclusion that we need to start moving towards, which this committee is going to have to deal with sooner rather than later, is that the State needs to ensure that the provision of long-term care of our elderly is brought under public control and that oversight and legislation arming HIQA and others are required to end what is happening here and to develop a nursing home sector that is accountable and directly run by our health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020091000002#M01900","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599692400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>The Deputy is over time but I will allow the witnesses to respond given the importance of what she has raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020091000002#N00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599692400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

I am substituting for Deputy Matt Shanahan who is unable to be here today.  I have a number of specific questions.  The most frequently used word in all of the discussion I heard while I was listening to the proceedings is \"learning\".  We have been learning since this outbreak first occurred.  A number of issues have arisen in respect of which I would like to pose a number of questions.<\/p> <p>  First, temporary agency staff are employed in the residential care sector, often travelling between residences and thus creating disease transmission risk.  What is the status of employment in the sector and have full or part-time positions been created to reduce this sectoral need?  Second, the Government is considering the use of rapid testing to facilitate increased travel.  Does HIQA plan to offer such tests to the nursing home sector to identify potential caseload development and early warning of disease presentation? Third, a lack of isolation rooms or space was identified as an issue during the first wave of Covid.  In the event of a second wave, is HIQA satisfied based on its desktop analysis that all care homes have made adequate provision for isolation where needed?  Fourth, the movement of patients from hospitals to nursing homes without prior Covid testing was a significant infection point in the outbreak of the disease.  Is HIQA satisfied that the correct hospital protocols are in place to ensure this situation cannot be repeated?  Fifth, I know first hand from nursing homes in my own area, which are in the private nursing home sector and have done Trojan work, that when they sought PPE, all the orders had been secured and taken into the control of the HSE, which, for a number of weeks, left the private nursing homes without access to supplies.  Is HIQA satisfied that arrangements are in place to ensure that whatever is available is available to everybody and not taken prisoner by the HSE?  My final question relates to HIQA staffing levels.  Is the authority satisfied that it has sufficient resources to deal with the ongoing Covid-19 crisis?  It was mentioned that the authority has been given additional staff.  At the end of the day, we need to ensure that the authority is working proactively and that it has the resources to do so.  Can Mr. Quinn confirm that he is satisfied that the authority has sufficient resources or does it require further resources?  That is an important point.  <\/p> <p>  The report reflects on why people are in nursing homes and considers whether they could be facilitated at home if they had proper nursing care.  I would welcome a comment on that issue.  It appears to be the default position that people go into nursing homes because they cannot be cared for at home when it is much easier to care for people at home.  I accept this is not an area of responsibility for the HIQA but I would welcome a comment on it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020091000002#P00400","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599692400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I will respond to some of them and I will then hand over to my colleagues to provide some of the detail on other questions.<\/p> <p>  On rapid testing, the specific test used is the oral and nasopharyngeal swab test.  I understand that NPHET and the expert advisory group are currently considering additional forms of testing.  We are aware of, and support, the programme of serial testing within nursing homes that has been able to identify a number of positive cases and enabled the sector and public health departments to manage specific cases within nursing homes.<\/p><p> In response to the question on HIQA staff, I would say we do not have enough staff to deal with Covid-19 and the post-Covid-19 environment.  However, we welcome the recent announcement of nine additional staff.  I also acknowledge the very significant additional work that has been identified for us in the report of the expert panel.  As I mentioned, we have lodged a business case with the Department of Health, including a workforce plan which addresses several of those key issues.<\/p><p> Another question concerned the reasons people are in nursing homes.  We believe that as time passes, the regulatory environment should reflect the emergence of new models of care such as those described in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We fully support the premise that people should be cared for in or as close as possible to their homes for as long as possible.  The Deputy is right to point out that older persons' care in Ireland has been very heavily weighted towards residential care as a default.  If we embrace the principles and models articulated in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we believe those models would progress just as the Deputy has described.  I will defer to Ms Cliffe on some of the other issues the committee has raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020091000002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599692400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will start with the issue of temporary agency staff.  That is a key concern for all providers at the moment.  They are moving towards independently staffing their own centres where possible.  Where agency staff are in use, they tend to be allocated to one nursing home.  That has done a lot to minimise the crossover of staff between nursing homes.  The question of how to staff nursing homes safely is really exercising providers, whether they are publicly or privately funded.  Many nursing homes are also availing of alternative accommodation arrangements to secure their staff and ensure they are as safe as possible from Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of one nursing home in Cloyne that is currently participating in a trial of a rapid Covid-19 test.  Work is ongoing in the sector, but I am not aware of the results.  Isolation rooms continue to be an issue.  This does not pertain so much in the private sector, which has largely done the heavy lifting on improving premises.  It is a key issue in some centres with large numbers of multi-occupancy rooms.  We have worked with some providers on arrangements to offset the lack of isolation rooms, but other providers are essentially keeping rooms in their centres vacant to be able to afford isolation.<\/p> <p>  We spoke earlier about the contingency assessment planning framework we published towards the end of April.  This is the kind of information that fed into that.  As we engaged with providers during the 150 contingency assessment inspections we carried out, staffing and how to respond to a case or suspected case of Covid-19 emerged as key issues.  Some providers are challenged by this, particularly if there are large numbers of cases which must be isolated in different parts of the nursing home.  They are very cognisant of this issue and are drawing up a plan A, a plan B and a plan C to be able to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  People moving from hospitals to nursing homes are now largely tested prior to transfer.  About three versions ago, the HPSC guidelines required all residents admitted to a nursing home to be isolated for 14 days.  They had to be cared for separately to the rest of the nursing home residents on arrival.  That presents some difficulty for residents but it is deemed to be the safest way to manage this.  The risk is not so much the residents with Covid-19, because if the management knows a resident is coming who has or is recovering from Covid-19, precautions can be taken.  The risk comes from residents coming from the community and acute care facilities where infection has not been recognised.<\/p><p>The practice of isolating residents for two weeks on arrival in a nursing home has largely mitigated that risk.<\/p><p> Regarding the availability of PPE, when we started calling nursing homes on 13 March and we saw we could have the greatest impact as an interface between nursing homes and the HSE or the Department, PPE arose clearly as a key issue, meaning both access to PPE in the event of a diagnosis and security of supply as providers went through the process of caring for residents with PPE.  This interaction with the HSE at community healthcare organisation, CHO, level resulted in the setting up of the HSE crisis management teams, which did Trojan work once they were up and running.  Those crisis management teams have members for PPE, assisted payments, oxygen and anything else that has been recognised as an issue to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020091000002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Cliffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1599692400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

Fabulous work is going on there in difficult times.  Great thanks and praise are due for that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask the witnesses several questions and give them a chance to reply.  Why did HIQA not raise the issue of nursing homes with NPHET?  One member of NPHET states that the team's minutes show a member of HIQA to have been present for the first mention of nursing homes in March.  It seems to me that HIQA did not have a plan for this pandemic.  Perhaps the witnesses will correct me and say that it did.  I would like to know what plan was in place at that early stage when the country knew it was facing something very serious.<\/p> <p>  I note that the issue of community hospitals was raised during a previous hearing on 26 May.  The question of why they were not brought up to standard was asked.  I am not allowed to mention a certain community hospital in west Cork but I have looked at the HIQA reports.  For quite some time HIQA reports have referred to very serious issues in this hospital - not pertaining to staff, but to the hospital building.  This was outside the remit of those working in the hospital, but it was within the remit of the HSE to bring the hospital up to standard.  This was not done, which put the staff under phenomenal pressure.  Why were standards not upheld throughout these hospitals by the time of the first deadline in 2016?  Why has HIQA waited until 2020 to challenge the HSE in respect of the physical environment standards and the need to implement legislation equitably for all providers?<\/p> <p>  Why has HIQA continued to allow the HSE to operate in substandard accommodation in breach of care and welfare regulations?  I regularly visit hospitals with meticulous standards.  I know of many examples throughout west Cork.  However, I ask this question because some hospitals were in breach of HIQA's regulations for many years and nothing happened.

Has the number of inspections increased or decreased in the light of Covid?<\/p> <p>  In anticipation of a second wave, what would HIQA recommend and do differently, given that it has some time to plan this time around?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020091000002#U01300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1599692400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>There have thus far been three meetings with the Department of Health about the nursing home expert recommendations.  A structured meeting schedule and implementation action plan are now in place under the direct chairmanship of the Department.  An oversight committee is yet to be put in place.<\/p><p>That is in train.  There are some immediate actions that will be taken and others are scheduled over the next 18 months or so.  That is in place.  My colleague will give the actual numbers.<\/p><p> As a regulator, we have learned that we can only work within the legal framework that we have, which the members, as legislators, will understand.  We cannot work outside that framework.  The only decisions and judgments we can make relate to compliance with regulations.  We have, therefore, identified and outlined ten key regulations specific to Covid-19, which, if they were enhanced, would give us stronger oversight of the quality and safety of services in that regard.  <\/p><p> We have been asked about isolation facilities, etc.  By way of an example, if we register a nursing home that has 60 beds, the provider is registered to provide 60 beds to accommodate 60 residents.  If our inspectors find that there is an issue with the quality and safety of care and recommend that there should only be 50 residents in that nursing home, it will take 56 days before we are able to enforce that condition.  Included in the recommendations that we have suggested in writing to the Minister and Department is that the primary legislation needs to be looked at.  It needs two key changes, although I accept that there are much longer-term legislative and policy changes required.  There are two specific legislative changes in the area of primary care that would create a safety net for residents, providers, policymakers, the Government and the general public in the context of Covid-19.  The first is that we should be given powers to immediately place a condition on a nursing home's registration.  That would not negate a provider's constitutional right to an appeal but it would mean that a condition would be put in place while allowing the provider to appeal thereafter.  As a consequence of the evidence we would gather, it would allow us to do that.<\/p><p> The second change would be to have compliance plans.  The committee can already see that some regulatory authorities, such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, have such plans.  That would provide a strong assurance to the Government, members of the public, providers and residents.  As I say, that does not take away the right of appeal but allows an action to be taken before the completion of an appeal.<\/p><p> Those are some of the elements we have included in the ten regulations we have outlined.  They are very much focused on the issues we have talked about, including premises, healthcare, staffing, governance and management, infection control, risk management and all the elements a provider must have in place to assure the quality of the service.  It is important to remember that, in the legislation, the responsible entity for the provision of care is the registered provider.  HIQA, as regulator, is the third line of defence.  The first line is those delivering the care and the second is the person governing the care.  Professional and systems regulators, such as HIQA, then have a part to play.  <\/p><p> We have learned other lessons.  We will be provide webinars for all providers and senior staff across the nursing home sector.  As the Deputy said, there are 570 nursing homes in the country and 1,200 designated centres for adults and children with disabilities which also fall under our remit.  These adults and children are also a vulnerable group in the current pandemic and public health emergency.  We will provide webinars in conjunction with the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, to enforce and give direction and support to private and public bodies in the context of the provision of care.  As Mr. Quinn has outlined, 4,500 people have already used our online infection control and prevention training programme.  There is quite an amount that we have already done and identified and, as is the case with everybody else, there is quite an amount that we will hold up our hands and admit we have learned and to which we have adapted accordingly.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Cliffe, who will answer that question on quantum.

Separate to that, having issued the contingency planning assessment framework and guidance so that those centres that had not yet experienced Covid-19 could learn from it, we then carried out 150 inspections against the arrangements that were in place in the nursing homes against that guidance.

Unless it was a new centre, there would have been a follow-up inspection but what we have prioritised in these ongoing risk inspections are the regulations most pertinent to the current context of Covid-19 so it is about infection prevention and control, residents' rights, healthcare, management of behaviours, and the premises.  It is those kind of regulations.  Our inspections now, as the expert advisory group acknowledged, are quite labour intensive at the moment.  We have to send more inspectors into nursing homes than previously to accommodate for Covid-19 so the 106 inspections we have done since the end of May have quantified at approximately 267 inspector days.

Based on what I heard earlier in the back and forth between HIQA and other Deputies, I cannot but take that what they are looking for is what they have asked of Government which is a greater level of power and a framework in which they can operate.

For example, that would happen if a registration is to be renewed.
