The importance of wind and offshore energy has only grown with time.  It is vital that we harness these sources in the right way.  The climate action plan sets out a target of 5,000 MW of offshore wind electricity by 2030.  Events in recent years and months, such as the war in Ukraine and climate change, have highlighted the importance of utilising these sources of energy.  Ireland is particularly well placed, especially around the west coast, to avail of wind energy, and we need to take this opportunity so we can have a real and positive impact in achieving our climate action goals.  Job creation in this area is something we hope to see grow and prosper and I hope the witnesses can inform the committee about this.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased we have the opportunity to consider the matter further with the following representatives.  I welcome from Wind Energy Ireland Mr. Noel Cunniffe, CEO, and Mr. Justin Moran, director of external affairs.  I welcome Ms Vanessa O'Connell, head of Inis Offshore Wind and vice-chairperson of the offshore supply chain working group.

I am joined by my colleagues: Mr. Justin Moran, director of external affairs; Ms Vanessa O&rsquo;Connell, head of Inis Offshore Wind and vice-chairperson of our offshore supply chain working group; and Mr. Kieran Ivers, CEO of Green Rebel.  Wind Energy Ireland represents the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential part of our low carbon energy future.  It is important to emphasise that we represent the whole supply chain.  As might be expected, our members manufacture turbines, develop projects and operate wind farms.  They also include Irish engineering, transport, surveying and planning companies.  Together, our industry employs approximately 6,000 people.  For us, it is not enough that we develop the 5,000 MW of offshore wind energy set out in the climate action plan and the even greater potential in the deeper waters off our south and west coasts.  We want to see Irish wind farms creating jobs in Ireland, supporting Irish businesses, providing training and education opportunities for Irish workers, and growing a thriving new industry.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by briefly telling the committee the story of two countries, Ireland and Scotland.  Ireland&rsquo;s only existing offshore wind farm, Arklow Bank, became operational in 2004, nearly two decades ago.  It consists of seven wind turbines and, at the time, it was one of the largest offshore wind farms in Europe.  It was the first time a wind turbine with a generating capacity of 3 MW was ever installed anywhere in the world and it is still operating today.  I would ask members to consider this for a moment; at one time Ireland was at the cutting edge of offshore wind energy and then we stopped.  It was a full three more years before the first Scottish offshore wind farm started generating electricity but Scotland did not stop.  As of 2019 there were 4,700 people employed in Scotland&rsquo;s offshore wind sector and it contributed nearly &pound;1 billion to the Scottish economy.  Today, there is almost 2,000 MW of offshore wind operational in Scotland and another 8,400 MW in construction or advanced development.  It is no surprise that in 2020 renewable energy provided 97% of Scotland&rsquo;s power.  Put simply, in the 2000s we did not take advantage of an enormous opportunity and I am here today to ask for the support of committee members to ensure we do not make the same mistake again.<\/p> <p>  With climate change and the crisis in Ukraine there is an even more urgent responsibility to transform our energy system to one that is clean, secure and equitable, while protecting our marine environment and securing the confidence of fishing and coastal communities.  Offshore wind will deliver greater energy security; it is the key to our energy independence.  With the right approach - with Government, industry and coastal communities working together - we can build a new industrial sector, supporting regional development, creating thousands of jobs and driving sustainable growth.  Other European countries, like Poland and Britain, have put in place an industrial strategy and a sector deal between the domestic offshore industry and those Governments.  These bring together the offshore renewables industry and the relevant state agencies and Government departments to maximise the value of the industry domestically for clean growth, which includes a strong focus on building the domestic supply chain.  We want a sector deal for Ireland but first we need to ensure our port infrastructure is ready.<\/p><p> In May 2020, we published an analysis called Harnessing our Potential.  It was produced by the Carbon Trust, which is a leading UK-based consultancy.  Harnessing our Potential is still the most comprehensive analysis to date of Ireland's offshore supply-chain potential.  It included a thorough examination of Irish ports and harbours.  Ports have two key roles in supporting offshore wind energy.  They can serve as an operations and maintenance base for an offshore wind farm.  Larger ports with extensive infrastructure can provide construction or marshalling services.  Several Irish harbours are suitable as operations and maintenance bases.  Members of this committee may be aware that two of our members, namely, Codling Wind Park and SSE with its Arklow Bank Wind Park, have already announced that if their projects are successful that they will use Wicklow and Arklow harbours, respectively, as their bases.<\/p><p> Each base translates to approximately 80 full-time jobs.  Each base is normally accompanied by extensive investment in local services and port infrastructure.\u00a0 However, when it comes to construction and marshalling services, at present the only port on the island of Ireland can do this, which is Belfast Harbour.  The facilities at Belfast are first class but we will need much more.  We cannot deliver our offshore energy ambitions from a single port.<\/p><p> It is important that members appreciate that if projects cannot find suitable available ports in Ireland, they can, and will, build from ports on the west coast of Britain, from France and even from the Netherlands.  Some of these ports already engage with our projects.  Irish wind farms could create jobs in Cherbourg and support businesses in Rotterdam.  As we stated in May 2020, strategic investment must be directed urgently into Irish ports to enable them to build the infrastructure needed to support the construction of offshore wind energy.  We are currently carrying out a new analysis of existing port infrastructure and the expansion plans to meet the needs of offshore renewables that a number of these ports are bringing forward.  We will complete this analysis over the summer and I look forward to sharing it with the committee then.<\/p><p> As well as an infrastructure gap, we face a skills gap.  For example, we will need hundreds of new wind-turbine technicians.  Right now, with the support of Skillnet Ireland, we train between ten to 20 people every year with our partners in Green Tech Skillnet.   In addition, a turbine technician apprenticeship programme in Kerry awaits validation but these initiatives will not be enough.  Already we have seen our members and State bodies struggle to recruit ecologists, marine biologists and planners.  We will literally need thousands of civil, electrical and marine engineers.<\/p><p> I spoke to colleagues from the British and Scottish offshore wind energy industry at an Enterprise Ireland event last week.  I was struck by how they too have identified a shortage in skills and personnel as one of their most significant challenges.  Last year, the expert group on future skills needs published the Skills for  Zero Carbon report and I will highlight a small number of its recommendations.  The report recommended co-ordinated planning for training within the renewable energy sector through partnerships between Government, industry and training providers, the prioritising of training for jobs in renewable energy that are set to be in high demand, including marine planners, turbine technicians, hydrogen specialists and other technical roles, the expansion of existing maritime training to meet demand from the offshore energy sector and engagement with the fishing community to give people with experience working at sea the option to transfer into the offshore wind sector.  The report concluded by noting \"Given the urgency of meeting Ireland&rsquo;s climate action goals, it is crucial that ... these recommendations are prioritised ... and are centrally driven by Government ... working in close collaboration with industry and the education and training system.\"  We fully endorse the report and urge the committee to support the establishment of this implementation group, as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> It is important to acknowledge several significant recent positive initiatives that have been taken by the Government.  Late last year, the Department of Transport published an updated policy statement that set out a strategy for commercial ports to facilitate offshore renewable energy.  The Department also worked successfully with other EU member states to amend the Connecting Europe Facility criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for offshore wind.  This initiative has enabled some Irish ports to apply for that funding to expand for servicing offshore wind energy but not all.   The Department has also established a port co-ordination group to discuss issues around port <\/p><p> We would like to welcome the establishment of the cross-departmental offshore wind delivery task force, which will include a focus on supply-chain issues.  Our industry would welcome the opportunity to join the task force and work together to ensure that there is a determined focus on maximising the economic benefits of offshore wind energy to Ireland.  Finally, I commend the efforts of Enterprise Ireland in particular, which last week launched an Irish offshore wind supply-chain cluster called the Gael Offshore Network.  The network consists of more than 65 Irish companies, including many of our members.<\/p><p> Irish businesses are already getting ready for Ireland's offshore renewable energy potential and some are starting to compete internationally.  We have enough offshore wind power to power this country and export energy as both electricity and green hydrogen.  The need is there and the potential is there.  If Irish ports and businesses are not able to take advantage of this opportunity, then there is no doubt that others will step in.  The chance to develop a skills base and an industry that can compete internationally in a rapidly growing global renewable energy market will be lost.  This is the time for Ireland to seize the opportunity, and bring together industry, policymakers and communities to ensure these multi-billion euro investments in zero-carbon generation create thousands of skilled jobs at home, and regenerate coastal communities right around the island.  We need to unite industry, Government, the relevant State agencies, and our fishing and coastal communities behind a shared vision for true energy independence and the creation of a thriving offshore renewable energy industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunniffe.

I am happy to share a copy of the report with members after the meeting.  We represent a large number of members with commercial interest in floating wind energy projects.  Many of these projects are developing to compete for 2030 and deliver as part of the phase 2 process for Government.  Phase 1 will be an initial phase of offshore wind energy development, which will include five projects located off the east coast and one project off the west coast.<\/p> <p>  Floating wind energy is a huge opportunity for Ireland's south and west coasts.  We believe that in order for floating wind energy to develop during this decade then there will need to be specific pot within the second renewable electricity support scheme auction for offshore renewables.  At the moment this has not yet been decided upon.  There was a Government consultation on that a few months and we expect to hear the results very soon.  The reason that this sector will need its own pot in the middle of the decade is that floating wind energy this decade will not be able to compete directly on price with fixed-bottom offshore wind energy, which will be the predominant technology that will be developed off our coasts this decade.  We believe that despite not being able to compete economically just yet, they will become economically competitive in the 2030s.  For Ireland, particularly off our west coast, there is an enormous potential for floating offshore wind energy as we transition to overall energy independence.  So we feel that it would be a worthwhile investment by the State to invest and allow some floating offshore wind energy projects to connect by 2030 in order that we can take those learnings and start to bring in the supply chain and develop that within Ireland.  While this is nascent technology in many countries around Europe, the supply chain is not yet there so we have not lost that opportunity yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This technology then is specifically for the west and south coasts of Ireland and it will be fixed-bottom wind energy for the east coast.

For the west coast potential, generally speaking there are limited areas that are suitable for the development of fixed-bottom turbines so it will be floating offshore wind off our west coast.

He will understand that people on the coast have an interest in how close a wind farm will be to them.  It is my understanding that fixed-bottom wind farms can be located so far out that they will not impinge on the view, but there is also a belief that, since they have to be closer in than floating wind farms, it would be better to wait until the floating technology was ready.  I do not agree, as the time for this is now, but the view has been expressed to me that we should perhaps wait until the floating technology is a little more developed.  Is it correct to say that fixed-bottom technology is fairly developed, is in place elsewhere and can be located far offshore?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#B00600","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Exactly.  There are approximately 25 GW of offshore wind energy deployed in the world right now, and almost all of it is fixed-bottom.

Even off the east coast, Irish waters get very deep very quickly.  As such, deploying fixed-bottom technology is the right approach to take.<\/p> <p>  We represent floating wind energy members as well as fixed-bottom wind energy members.  The floating wind energy community says that we need to establish a supply chain in Ireland and get offshore wind going right now so as to harness and take advantage of the floating wind energy opportunity fully.

The challenge is that it is our members that are developers rather than our members that are ports that will be setting out the specifications for what they would like to see in a port, for example, pier length and water depth.  There is something that we can bring to the table in terms of discussing our needs and readiness, which is one of the reasons that we commissioned the report that Mr. Cunniffe mentioned in his opening statement.  In that all-island report, we identified 13 ports north and south of the Border and investigated what port infrastructure existed right now to construct and marshal an offshore wind farm.  It also considered what could be in place in two or three years' time if ports like Rosslare and Shannon Foynes delivered on their infrastructural development plans.  We have been happy to support those plans in terms of their applications to the Connecting Europe Facility.  I hope that, when we bring the report to members of this committee, we will have a much clearer understanding of what is in place and what needs to be in place.

They are not just people who are installing the turbines, but also planners, hauliers and the entire supply chain, including people working in financial institutions across the country.  We have commissioned a report, entitled \"Harnessing our potential: Investment and jobs in Ireland's offshore wind energy\", which I referenced in my opening statement.  It examined Ireland's old target for offshore renewable energy, which was 3.5 GW.  We have since increased that to 5 GW.

I was involved in development, construction and operations.  Something that I saw that was a success and that has since become a platform for growth of offshore wind and ensured that the benefits of offshore wind energy are harvested for the UK was a sector deal that was signed in 2019.  Effectively, it was a partnership between the British Government and industry.  It was a handshake whereby industry and the British Government were committing to actions in terms of delivering offshore wind energy in the UK.  At the time, the target was to deliver 30 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.  That target has since been accelerated to 50 GW.  In terms of the industry, part of that was to be 60% local content.  This was not a mandatory target, but a vision that the industry committed to working towards together.<\/p> <p>  There is an opportunity in Ireland that is not just about the green electrons, but about creating a whole new industry that can benefit the people of Ireland and generate many jobs.

In terms of working together, we welcome the offshore wind energy task force that has been established by the Government, but let us bring the industry to the table and work together in collaboration more frequently.

They are all coming forward with proposals, ideas and plans and the cost of each of them will vary because some ports have different levels of infrastructure in place.  In terms of a ball park figure, we are talking about tens of millions of euro but the actual figure will vary from project to port to port.

We hope to start construction in 2025 or 2026 at the outside so the question for us is whether ports other than Belfast will be ready then for those projects.  Belfast will be able to take some of that work.  It is a first-class facility but it cannot build six Irish offshore wind farms at the same time.  If those ports are not ready, those projects will be looking to other ports and other infrastructure opportunities to provide the construction marshalling services.

They are landed there and taken to the wind farms.<\/p> <p>  We are not here to pick a port winner.  There will be enough work in the development of offshore wind energy in Ireland to provide opportunities for every significant port in this country.  Even for some smaller ports and harbours, there are opportunities for them to be operations and maintenance bases.  When we look at the west coast in particular, and as the Senator noted, the wind speeds out there are fantastic, it is not just about the opportunity to construct, marshal, operate and maintain those projects.  We can be innovators and leaders out there because we will be developing offshore wind energy in some of the windiest parts and deepest waters of the world and we can take the skills we develop there, and I do not know if Mr. Ivers would like to come in on this because I know it is an area in which Green Rebel has worked, and take them around the world and compete internationally.  One of the things we want to get across here is that if we can build an Irish supply chain to support Irish offshore wind farms, there is no reason those Irish companies will not be building wind farms off the coast of China, the US or Africa in 15 or 20 years time or less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Green Rebel has quite a lot of scientists.

There could be a situation where a main port is being used for marshalling services and a nearby port is also involved in taking on some of that work.  There can be multi-port opportunities.  The facility at Belfast Port is fantastic.  If the committee members ever get the chance to visit it, I highly recommend it.  It is an example of what first-class facilities for construction and marshalling look like.  With the best will in the world, you cannot build 5,000 MW of offshore wind simultaneously in five different projects from that facility.  Either you put them in a queue, basically, and do them as quickly as possible to get through the work, or you find other port facilities or infrastructure.  With Shannon Foynes, there is enormous potential for the port to be a hub not just for the construction of offshore wind farms but as a place where we can bring power onshore and create green hydrogen, which is one of the real exciting export opportunities for Ireland.

We are now aiming for an 80% renewable figure.  It is important to put the issue in context and it is worth saying that Scotland is different.  That brings me to the following question.  With capital and construction capacity scarce for public investment in Ireland, the organisations represented today are urging the Government to do more and to put more of its money into accelerating offshore wind beyond what it is already anticipating.  I want to tease that out.  Are the organisations' higher ambitions conditional on export?  Is that really the context, rather than greening our existing grid?  Will it require additional interconnection and the development of the green hydrogen sector?  There are obviously different phases to the work, and different elements have higher priority at a time of constrained resources, a housing crisis and all of the other issues.  The challenge facing the Government is choosing which of these things are most urgent.  How do the organisations represented assess that urgency in the context of other issues, as well as the fact that it requires the development of a hydrogen sector that is still relatively underutilised?  There needs to be a hydrogen strategy here that gives us a context for that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have stated that there the water off the west coast is extraordinarily  deep, conditions are harsh, and will still be difficult to work in.  Should this be more of a European infrastructural play than simply an Irish play?  Should we be looking to the longer-term global context in which the Atlantic resource will be tapped into?  Does that alter the view of the witnesses on how this opportunity should be developed?<\/p> <p>  I am also interested to know what the successful elements of the Scottish strategy were, and what mistakes were made so that we can perhaps learn from them.  I know that the Scottish project is different.  Scotland has a bigger connection and a bigger demand source on its doorstep.  Those are my questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#E00900","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I might refer to my colleague, Ms O'Connell, to respond to the Deputy's question on the Scottish strategy.  I agree with the Deputy that the target that we have to deliver 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030 is extremely ambitious.  We definitely think it is deliverable but in order for that to happen, a lot of things need to fall into place in terms of our planning system, our grid system and our route to market.  We appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action a few months ago.  We stated that we have a 50:50 chance of achieving the 5 GW the target for offshore wind energy specifically.  We are not here to say that we need a higher target for offshore wind.  We are saying that we really need to double down and focus on delivering that 5 GW of offshore wind energy.  That said, we want the highlight the opportunity that that target presents for the domestic supply chain.  It is true that capital and resources are scarce but those projects will be built.  The question that we would like to highlight today is whether they will be built from Irish ports and by Irish companies.  That is why the establishment of a delivery task force on supply chain to try to produce an action plan is critical, so that as much of that potential and investment that we are going to see to deliver our 2030 targets remains within Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On whether the potential we are talking about is really for the export opportunity, we will need an enormous amount of electricity to service Ireland as we go towards 2050 and towards becoming a climate-neutral country.  We did some analysis with UCC's MaREI centre looking at a zero-carbon economy for Ireland.  It showed that electricity demand will triple between now and 2050, predominantly as we electrify heat and transport.  We are going to need around 25 GW of offshore wind energy purely for our own domestic purposes before we even contemplate the export potential opportunity that we have off our west coast, which we believe to be equivalent to around 70 GW to 80 GW of capacity.  The establishment of a hydrogen supply chain will be very important to that over time.  We are not talking about purely direct electrification for everything.  The electricity grid that we currently have is not capable of managing the level of energy that I have just spoken about.  We will need hydrogen in order to decarbonise heat and transport, but the source and the base of that will be offshore wind energy.  The more that we can establish our own supply chain, the better.<\/p> <p>  On the European side of things, currently, countries across Europe are trying to get off fossil fuels as quickly as possible, following the crisis in Ukraine.  We are seeing countries right across Europe increasing their targets for offshore wind energy every week.  Two years ago, the 2030 offshore wind target in Europe was 60 GW.  Just two weeks ago there was an announcement that Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands will be developing 65 GW by themselves between now and 2030.  Right across Europe, we are hearing that supply chain constraints are a big challenge.  All the countries will need to pool together their resources and supply chains if we are to have any chance of meeting Europe's target.

When the sector deal was signed, it was looking at offshore wind in the whole of the UK.  As it has developed, Scotland has started to focus on what Scotland can do itself, rather than with England and Wales.  Looking at the whole of the UK, one of the lessons learned is thinking about what the different parts of the country need.  Originally, there was the Offshore Wind Industry Council, which was for the whole of the UK.  Now, Scotland has its own Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council.  It is looking at what Scotland needs, rather than what the rest of the UK needs.  That is one of the lessons learned.<\/p><p>It has also been a focus in the UK.  The benefits of offshore wind are not concentrated within one area.  The wind farms are all around the coast.  We need therefore to look to understand where we can develop clusters for innovation for the development of the supply chain.  That is in around areas such as Cork, the west, Foynes and the east.  That cluster effect is important for having a national strategy, as well as for thinking about what we need in different parts of the country.  That is one key lesson that has been learned.  It is also safe to say that the UK and Scotland are still on the journey in offshore wind.  They have been successful to date, but they still have much work to do.  We are also facing some of the challenges they are facing.  There are lessons to learned by working together.  Some of those challenges, particularly for Scotland, relate to grid infrastructure.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised the point of export opportunity around interconnection.  That is also a challenge for Scotland.  We must understand that they are nearly at 100% renewables on their system.  They are already exporting their energy to England.  They are looking to see where they can export it abroad.  System integration is a challenge.  Resourcing is also a challenge.  That is a key challenge for Ireland.  It is a matter of resourcing within the industry as well as across the industry, for example with the likes of EirGrid, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the environmental organisations.  This comes back to our point that it is important that we come together to learn the lessons from other markets.  Those primarily come from the industries.  It is a matter of many international players coming to Ireland and people like myself coming back to Ireland.  We can share the lessons we have learned.  We can ask what is right for Ireland.  We can ask what we want the vision to be.

There are still many uncertainties in terms of policies related to grid infrastructure and planning systems.  These are being baked into driving up costs.  When it comes to costs specifically for offshore wind and for floating offshore wind energy, we do not yet have a good example in Europe for what the costs of developing floating offshore wind energy for commercial-scale projects will be.  Britain and France are both in the process of developing and running auctions specifically for floating wind energy.

Such a strategy is in the process of being developed, but we do not have it yet.  We understand the consultation for that will be published shortly.  As a country, we need to stimulate not just the supply of hydrogen, which is where the renewable energy comes in, but also the demand for hydrogen.

The more certainty that we can provide to the development community for renewable electricity through having a planning system, a grid system and a supply chain that works, the cheaper we can produce renewable power and the cheaper we can transition to hydrogen.

I have met Mr. Cunniffe and Mr. Moran at exhibitions and so on and we have engaged.  I have a specific concern, as I have highlighted to them, about the potential for wind energy off the south-east coast, not least in the Copper Coast area, and the potential for damage to amenities.  It is important that this committee has an ongoing engagement with the wider wind energy sector, but I would support our guests' call for at least a sector deal and for a representative from the offshore industry to sit on the co-ordination group.  Perhaps that is something the committee can speak about in private session.<\/p> <p>  As I have said to our guests previously, I have concerns about a lack of State ownership in the wind energy sector as it develops, primarily because we do not have expertise and I can see that something similar to what happened with the oil industry is going to happen.  Ultimately, we will sell the licences, foreign players will come in and provide everything and we will ask what we really got out of it.   We might not even get a good rate of electricity charged to the State.<\/p> <p>  I am also worried about how the coastal communities will be looked after.  One issue I have previously raised relates to how a community dividend, which in general in the wind sector is looked at for about 15 years over the lifetime of a farm, should be paid every year.  If a turbine turns at sea or on land, a community needs to be resourced from that.  I am worried not only about amenities in tourism but also about the fishing industry.  Ms O&rsquo;Connell might speak about Scotland in a moment.  Some of the largest spawning grounds in Europe are to be found off the south coast of Ireland, so she might comment on the effects of talking about putting wind infrastructure out there.<\/p> <p>  Is any potential tie-up being signalled for people who are coming in to invest in wind infrastructure whereby they would also tie in hydrogen development?  Rather than say we are going to create wind farms and then talk about creating hydrogen plants, are any conglomerates interested in coming with that package and saying that as part of their wind farm licence, they would be prepared to invest in hydrogen development onshore?  In the south east, we have one of the most significant gateways to composite developments in the form of turbine manufacture.  Mr. Cunniffe referred to a course starting in Kerry, but we need very significant academic linkage and his organisation mentioned it was hoping to engage with higher education.<\/p> <p>  We are at an early stage, but I would like to see a sectoral deal done, with our guests getting representation and with us, as a committee, engaging with them twice a year.  It would be good to get committee members out - visits to Belfast, Scotland or wherever were mentioned - to understand where this wind generation deal is going.  There is no doubt there is opportunity in this for Ireland, but I very much fear it is going to pass us by.  I fear that foreign players will dominate the space and that we may not see much out of it other than, as I said, a not very competitive tariff on wind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#G00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I might hand over to Ms O'Connell to take the fishing question relating to Scotland and to my colleague, Mr. Moran, to comment on coastal communities.  In regard to the State ownership question, there are many active State-owned companies in the energy sector in Ireland right now.  Everyone will be familiar with the ESB, one of the largest owners of onshore wind energy in Ireland.  Through a partnership between the ESB and Coillte, Future Energy Ireland has been established as a State company developing onshore wind energy and Bord na M&oacute;na is very much established as an onshore wind energy and solar developer as well.  There is a great deal of State involvement in that.  Moreover, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is one of the main investors in Ms O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s Inis Offshore Wind.  We will see investment from the State in that.<\/p> <p>  Any offshore wind farm that is developed around Ireland will also pay a seabed lease, so revenue for the State will be generated from every offshore wind farm that is developed.  We are also seeing considerable levels of investment in, as I mentioned, many ports throughout the country, which are putting up their hands and saying they want to invest here and to keep as much money in Ireland as they can.  We have seen those announcements in Arklow and Wicklow from maintenance and operations bases being set up.<\/p> <p>  My one concern, as has been suggested by a number of groups previously, is that if we were to take a step back and to establish a State body to develop offshore wind energy, it would take a very long time to resource that and to establish both it and a regulator.  We would not develop a single offshore wind turbine for the next ten to 15 years if we were to do that.  Many of the projects around our coasts have been in development for years or, in some cases, decades, and those projects need to proceed and we need to be able to establish that.  There is a significant role for the State in resourcing Departments.  We need a functional State Department, through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to be able to deliver the full potential for this industry in order that we can get a return for the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>In regard to fishing, I was working primarily in England but had some interaction with Scotland as well.

Nevertheless, it is important that when we come back to Ireland, we understand the concerns of the fishing industry here and how we can solve those problems.  Some lessons will be learned, but Ireland is unique and the fishing industry is really important to the country.   For us at Inis Offshore Wind, it is the number one stakeholder we have.  Very early on, we engaged with it to understand its concerns and how we could mitigate its concerns whether through the wind farm design or by finding ways to coexist.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Moran to discuss the initiative going on within Wind Energy Ireland, specifically as it relates to the fishing industry and the groups that have been formed.  I was very happy to hear the Deputy welcome the sector deal.

It relates to community benefit and to ensuring that will be spread over the lifetime of the project.  It is something we would like to see as well and we would expect to see it from our members, but the community benefit fund as a requirement of the contract an offshore wind farm will get is related to the duration of the contract.  We will clearly say to our members that just because the contract is running out, that does not mean they get to close shop and go away.  They will still need to support those local communities but the contract will run out after 15 or 16 years.<\/p> <p>  As for our engagement with the fishing community, we both do that at a project level, whereby officers talk to fishermen on specific piers and around harbours.  We are also increasingly doing it on a national level with the existing fishing organisations.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently appointed a chairperson for what is called the seafood offshore renewable energy working group, which will bring together about 11 or 12 fishing organisations and us, representing the offshore wind sector, but also - this is important - the Departments and State agencies that are relevant to this, such as Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These people have been put together to sit around the table and ensure that when we develop these wind farms, we will be conscious of the impact they may have on marine biodiversity and the environment and, in particular, on the coastal and fishing communities that depend on those waters for their livelihoods and to pay rent and send their kids to college.<\/p><p>Not only should these wind farms not be an impediment to them, there is an opportunity here.  I might bring Mr. Ivers in to talk about this in a moment.  There is enormous opportunity here for people with marine skills and there are very few people in Ireland with more marine skills than fishermen.  They would be able to work and be part of the development of offshore renewable energy.  It would also be useful to hear from Mr. Ivers about getting Irish companies into the supply chain.  We want Irish companies, whether semi-State bodies or private sector companies, to get into the Irish supply chain.

We are well aware that the bounty achieved in Cork from the Kinsale gas field was the contract for catering.  That needs to be reversed.  We cannot make the same mistakes again.  Ireland has a poor history in the context of benefiting from our own natural resources.  A sectoral deal is not an off-the-shelf solution.  It can only be achieved with collaboration between the Government, industry and officials.  The by-product of that type of collaboration is a sectoral deal that is bespoke to Ireland and that we can benefit from.  That should encourage the development of an indigenous supply chain, as well as foreign direct investment into Ireland.  We cannot do it all ourselves but we can encourage investment and make provisions so those who want to do business in Ireland have to invest in Ireland and not just create a postcode.  Deputy Bruton spoke about dipping into Ireland's coffers.  In Scotland, the industry stimulus that was provided, from the developer's pocket, as a result of that collaboration has been critically important.<\/p> <p>  Collaboration between entities will also help the Government identify some of the surmountable challenges the industry is facing right now.  One example in Green Rebel's world is this issue around licensing and foreshore licences.  Right now we have a buoy, a floating LiDAR innovation, which is best in class globally and was developed in Ireland specifically to target floating offshore wind.  We are having to send it to Rotterdam, and will continue to do so over the next two years, investing north of &euro;3 million, in order to get its certification because we cannot get licensing here.  We are not talking about the licensing of an offshore wind farm.  This is a tiny piece but these are surmountable challenges that can only be brought to this type of forum.

They may have learned lessons in other countries that can help deliver it here.<\/p> <p>  Earlier, Ms O'Connell mentioned the Offshore Wind Industry Council, which has been established in the UK.  It has considerable industry, Government and State buy-in to develop something similar to this.  The Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council has something similar too.  There was a Norwegian delegation in Wexford last week.  They also mentioned that there is industry involvement in their establishment.  Their partnership is not quite a sector deal, but people are coming together to deliver this.

In this context, it is important that the committee is aware that the secondment circular issued by my Department last year is for the Civil Service.  I will comment on certain other secondments but my Department&rsquo;s role in sanctioning secondments under this policy is only within the Civil Service.<\/p> <p>  In relation to secondment, the Civil Service secondment policy and associated terms were introduced in December 2021.  They were designed to complement the Civil Service mobility scheme, which is for permanent moves between Civil Service organisations, in that it enables the filling of positions concurrent with a strategic project\/placement that require specialist knowledge and skill sets for a defined period.  The policy recognises that a number of administrative arrangements had evolved across the Civil Service over time and was not intended to replace such sector-specific arrangements. <\/p> <p>  Secondments facilitate the release and movement of staff and may provide opportunities for staff to broaden their skills and continue their professional and personal development while retaining the right to return to their substantive or equivalent position.  It is a valuable arrangement that facilitates shared learning, good practice and new ideas.<\/p> <p>  Currently there are 17 staff of my Department that are seconded in from the civil or public service and there are 19 staff of my Department that are seconded out to the civil or public service.  Included in these numbers are two staff members who are seconded out to administrative roles in the third level sector.  One member of staff is seconded to Dublin City University and the other is seconded to the Technological Higher Education Association.<\/p> <p>  Also included is one staff member who is seconded in to my Department from National University of Ireland, Galway as a researcher as part of the Science Foundation Ireland programme.  <\/p> <p>  While the policy applies for secondments in the Civil Service, the policy also provides that the same principles should apply to secondment arrangements between a parent Department and a non-Civil Service body.  It is not a requirement for public service bodies, as distinct from Civil Service organisations, to seek sanction from my Department to fill a position through secondment.  That is a matter between the public service body and its parent Department.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence from the committee referred to recent secondments to third level institutions.  In respect of the recent secondments of two former Secretaries General to posts in third-level institutions, on the expiry of his term as Secretary General, Dr. Fergal Lynch moved on secondment to NUI Galway.  On the expiry of Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;&rsquo;s term as Secretary General he moved on secondment to NUI Maynooth.<\/p> <p>  These appointments were in line with Government decisions dating from October 2011 regarding the offer of an alternative position in the civil or public service or an international institution at a salary equivalent to Secretary General until preserved pension age and that retirement before that age would not be the norm.  These terms are reflected in the advertisement booklets for Secretary General posts.  Both secondments are time-limited, for periods less than five years.<\/p> <p>  Responsibility for third level institutions is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation, and Science in the first instance.  More generally however, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is involved in a number of ongoing cross-sectoral initiatives that aim to strengthen links between the Civil Service and the university sector in the area of public policy development.  In this regard, I draw the joint committee&rsquo;s attention to a number of such initiatives being pursued by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  IGEES operates under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its collaboration with academia is facilitated through the IGEES external advisory group, which consists of representatives from universities, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI.<\/p><p>IGEES seeks to further foster knowledge transfers and skills development of IGEES policy analysis by building more extensive networks across academia, through collaborative research, a research fund and various different events.<br\/><br\/>The secondments of Dr. Lynch and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; support, <i>inter alia<\/i>, progressing the work programme in this policy area, including links to the work being carried out under the Civil Service Renewal 2030 Strategy, led by my Department, and the recently established joint initiative of the Department of An Taoiseach and my Department, Strengthening Policy Development and Strategic Foresight in the Irish Public Service, which is a project being supported by the OECD.<br\/><br\/>Previous correspondence of the committee also referred to the proposed secondment of the Chief Medical Officer.  On this matter, my Department received a sanction request from the Department of Health on 31 March.  As part of this request, the Department of Health indicated the outgoing CMO would be moving to Trinity College Dublin to take up a professorship on a long-term secondment at the end of June and that it was expected that the secondment would continue until his retirement.  No further detail or material was provided in relation to that secondment.  As is usual with such requests, there was subsequent engagement at official level between my Department and the Department of Health in relation to it, and in relation to the funding aspects of it.  Following the announcement of the CMO of his intention to retire in July, the proposed secondment and associated arrangements were not of relevance to the sanction request for a replacement CMO and a letter of sanction for the post of the CMO issued from my Department on 21 April.  The subsequent report prepared by the Department of Health acknowledges that elements of the arrangements were not communicated well.  The independent review commissioned by the Minister for Health into the process related to the proposed secondment is ongoing and is a matter for that Department.<br\/><br\/>I trust this is of assistance to the committee and I am happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat as ucht teacht &oacute;s comhair an choiste chun an &aacute;bhar seo a phl&eacute;.  I thank Mr. Moloney for coming in front of the committee to discuss this topic.  To start off on secondments, the crux of the issue that people have been querying over the last number of weeks and months is in relation to a temporary nature of a secondment.  If we look at the HR section on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website, it states that a secondment is a temporary arrangement that facilitates the release and movement of staff members for a specified period of time in a way which does not affect their employment status.  It goes on to note that the maximum time period for this temporary arrangement is five years.  The circular Mr. Moloney referenced was published on the 31 December 2021.  Does this differ from previous circulars in relation to secondments because I, and people generally, would understand that a secondment is of a temporary nature?  Can Mr. Moloney comment on that?  Does he see a secondment as a temporary situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#B00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The purpose of trying to formalise the secondment policy in the circular, which is, I think, the first time it was done, was to try to clarify some of the issues that arose over time, where secondments were conducted in a variety of different ways.  In effect, many secondments became permanent by being rolled over on a continual basis.  The Civil Service mobility scheme, which was introduced and now covers all general service grades between clerical officer and assistant secretary, formalises the process of permanently transferring staff between Departments in the Civil Service.  Therefore, the remaining bit for secondment policy to do, outside of niche areas, specialist expertise or long-standing arrangements that are in place, is to try to regularise how temporary secondments take place.<\/p> <p>  There is a further complication in that where we second from the Civil Service to an outside body, the terms and conditions such as pension and other entitlements sometimes need to be maintained through a secondment arrangement and in some cases - for example, the two cases of Secretaries General I mentioned - that would make the secondment time limited but there is not an anticipation return to the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>In theory secondments are supposed to be temporary but in practice sometimes they are not.

This is our first attempt to try to bring clarity to this, just within the Civil Service.  Many of the issues that have arisen are in relation to proposed secondments between the Civil Service and the wider public service.  That is an area we can certainly look at.  The one thing I would say is that there is a huge number of secondments, they are really valuable to the system and they occur in a huge variety of different circumstances.  They occur in many different ways - for example, with international institutions, with the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service, the Attorney General's office and the Central Statistics Office.  Experts are seconded for periods of time into Government offices.  On occasion, those experts become quite imbedded in those Government offices and the secondment evolves in a way that makes it permanent.  What we are trying to do is to twin mobility and secondment policy.  We are trying to make all of that more transparent and make the conditions under which that could happen clearer.  The mobility policy is preferred as the vehicle to achieve permanent transfers and secondment policy, by and large, is there to facilitate temporary transfers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>What would other examples be of secondments being used on a permanent basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#B00800","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Quite often where somebody is seconded to an international organisation, such as the European Commission, traditionally, they would go on secondment but, in effect, they would be seconded there on a very long-term basis.

The Government decision in 2011 was a clear one.  It said that when a retiring Secretary General reaches the end of their term and has not yet reached preserved pension age, the minimum pension age, the Government may offer them an alternative position.  In the case of the two Secretaries General we are talking about, the Government made the decision late last year to do that.  It is a term and condition of the appointment of Secretaries General since 2011.  It is detailed in the Public Appointments Service, PAS, booklets on those competitions that at the end of their term, if they have not reached full retirement age, the Government can choose to offer them a post in the Civil Service, the public service or an international institution.  That is the policy that has been in place since 2011.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said that concerns have been raised about the similarity of the roles and there is a similarity.  Having decided to offer these two people a post, the Government took the opportunity to further one of the Civil Service renewal actions in public policy and improving public policy and particularly in terms of developing communities of practice that link in the academic sector with our work in the Civil Service and with Enterprise Ireland and other researchers.  We do part of that through IGEES but we want to do more of it under the banner of Civil Service and public service reform.  This was an opportunity to place them in universities and develop those networks.  Within my Department they are both involved in public service reform and there are slightly different public service reform aspects to this work.  One of the retired Secretaries General is involved in the organisational capability reviews and is chairing the group of Secretaries General who drive and oversee the organisational capability reviews.  For example one such review has been done in the Department of Defence and one has been done in the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The other retired Secretary General is more involved in a specific OECD project on strategic foresight, evidence-based policies and the structure and hierarchy of the Civil Service.  Both jobs are a mixture of a role within the university, networking and an attempt to build a greater community partnership within academia and the Civil Service and public service.  The elements of reform involved in each post are slightly different, as I have described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>That is interesting and that probably covers most of my questions.

We have a policy in place on that since 2011.  The December 2011 decision on this sets out what to do with retired Secretaries General and it offers a number of options.  In practice the option to extend the term of Secretaries General has often been taken.  There is the option of reassigning them within the Civil Service and public service and the option of seconding them to another position in the Civil Service, in the public service or in an international institution is also there.  The 2011 decision is clear that the object is not to make the retirement of Secretaries General at the end of their terms before preserved pension age the standard and usual practice.  I understand the question but I see it slightly differently, in terms of it being part of the terms and conditions under which the posts are advertised.  There is a clear understanding that at the end of your term, these different options exist to take you up to preserved pension age, which is what both of the cases we discussed today involve.  In explaining that policy, that is seen in an overall context where it would potentially be difficult to recruit people into those roles if they did not have a path at the end of their terms.  That is something the performance review group has identified as an issue.  It is also something the de Buitl&eacute;ir group that the Government has recently established to review senior public service recruitment and pay processes is looking at.  The treatment of Secretaries General at end of term in this context is one of the issues the group will look at, among the gamut of processes around the appointment of and remuneration for Secretaries General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The reason I asked the question is that I am conscious, as I am sure Mr. Moloney is, that in recent times we have had two Secretaries General who have gone on to become ambassadors.

I wish to point out that I probably have a different view from other people on this issue.  The people who have served their full-time, or not yet served their full-time, in the public service, may still have something to offer and it should not be lost.  Their experience and their ability should not be consigned to the waste.  They still have a lot to offer and while secondment may be an emotive issue, it does not take away from the fact that as, I think, Galbraith used to say, members of the older generation still have a lot to offer and although they may require longer holidays, they still could offer a great deal in terms of experience that should remain available to the public sector in the event that the public sector was of a mind to accept it.<\/p> <p>  There is a possibility that we have become \"soundbite-ist\", for want of a better description, in terms of our reaction as public representatives.  I do not contribute to that at all.  There was a situation in the military sector once upon a time where an army officer or anybody serving in the army would, after 21 years, avail of a full pension and go elsewhere.  That had the double effect of renewing the membership of the Defence Forces on a regular basis.  Without any particular intervention, people went elsewhere.  People, however, decided to change that and said it was not fair that some people were offered this concession, despite the fact that the original intention was to achieve the result of getting people to retire from the Defence Forces and giving them an incentive to do so.<\/p> <p>  I refer to taking the soundbites, the emotionalism and the populism out of it.  Everybody will oppose somebody getting something they think they should not get.  I know we have to protect ourselves and the integrity of the public sector but at the same time, we should keep in mind that the people retiring may still have something to offer.  The best way to utilise or to harness that energy, experience and enthusiasm, or whatever, needs to be found.  We have not always found it.  There are particular options open to some people, such as the Secretaries General referred to, in some Departments, but we need to look further and see how we can utilise those people's services to a greater extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#D01400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The professional can return to that role when the secondment finishes.  I know of cases where five or six years later, a professional backfilling that position is still temporary.  The consequences of that are significant.  If a person want to get a mortgage, he or she will not get one on having a non-secure employment position.  People are seconded for long durations over a five-year period and the backfilling of those positions is still temporary.

I know of a case of a former Deputy who was a member of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s party and who used to be my headmaster.  The person who replaced him in the school was temporary.  That is happening in the public sector.  People with professional degrees in our health sector, having been five or six years in the position, are not able to get a permanent contract because the position they are filling was vacated by somebody who was seconded to another position.  Two jobs of work need to be done.  We need to get an idea of where we are at with secondments and with the backfilling of roles.

However, Deputy Doherty made an interesting reference to the teachers who become Deputies or Senators.  It could be significant in their pension entitlements in the event that they serve one term or a short term of office in the Oireachtas and then find themselves with insufficient pension entitlements.  They might go back to the public service in teaching positions and they may have several years to go, a short number of years to go or insufficient years to go to achieve a full pension.  They could well find themselves at a distinct disadvantage.  My humble suggestion would be that those who are replacements should be able to go forward on the basis that they could achieve permanency after a short number of years and acquire full pension entitlements.  That is one of the things that needs to be looked at and done.<\/p><p>I am sure the Chairman already knows the following.  I made reference to the Defence Forces and much is made today of the fact that it is difficult to recruit and retain people there.  It is difficult because the Oireachtas took away those entitlements they had where the person who had entered the Defence Forces spent 21 years there and walked away with a full pension.  This person could take a part-time job or a smaller job that was sufficient to meet their requirements and that may have been in line with their needs to do less work and so on.  We have taken that away and it creates an obstacle to recruitment in the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>The following matter also needs to be borne in mind.  There is a system in the Defence Forces involving individuals who suffered personal injuries and who claimed and obtained compensation, be it 20 years ago, 30 years ago or whatever.  In those cases, assuming the person has been discharged from the Defence Forces as being unfit to serve due to their injuries, they then qualify for a pension.  In the course of the payment of that pension, a sum is deducted on a monthly basis to recover the payment made in respect of compensation, which is an appalling decision and this measure is regularly enforced.  The phrase in the Army Pensions Act 1927 states that &quot;The Minister may&quot; recover all or part of the amount of the previous award in determining the amount of pension the person may get.  It is an appalling thing to do to people who have served the country and who have been injured to the extent that they were no longer able to serve in the Defence Forces.  The Act says &quot;The Minister may&quot;; it does not say &quot;The Minister shall&quot; but we know all about that phrase over the years, what it means and the implications for the public service.  That is another matter that needs to be looked at in order to be fair to people who work in the public service and the private sector and who have reason to change over.<\/p><p>Those two issues need to be looked at.  Deputy Doherty is right regarding the point relating to teachers.  I would like to see a major change on the issue I referred to in respect of the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#H02300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy asking Mr. Moloney to make a------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#J00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I am not asking him to run in my constituency but I am sure he knows about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#J00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I am not fully sighted on it for this meeting but we can certainly have a look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022061500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>The Ministers and Secretaries Act is something this committee is interested in.

The Committee of Public Accounts is still in business.  If everything was functioning the way it should, that committee would not be in business because everything would be running so well.<\/p> <p>  In my time here, I have seen the same types of mistakes repeated over and over again.  That raises a question as to the response of public sector leadership and the Secretaries General as a collective to Departments overspending or causing a negative perception of themselves to develop.  Someone has to take responsibility for that.  If you look at the jobs Ministers are involved in nowadays, between Brussels and dealing with world affairs and home affairs, you will see that they are kept quite busy.  I presume they expect their Departments to take on the challenge of dealing with shortcomings.  That is where I am coming from with regard to sanctions, conditions of employment, accountability and transparency.  We all have to be accountable.  I believe that any Secretary General asked to come before a committee should do so.  That is my view.  Although the work of other committees should not be duplicated, they should come before the various committees of these Houses.  Until such time as there is change in respect of accountability and transparency, it is my view that Secretaries Generals should have to make themselves available.  The Secretaries General across the Departments should be making great efforts to ensure that issues that arise in the context of the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General are dealt with.  I am just giving Mr. Moloney my tuppence worth on the matter but I would like to see substantial change in that area.<\/p> <p>  We have come to the end of our discussion on this.  It has been worthwhile and informative.

As was mentioned, I am joined today by my colleagues, Mr. Muiris O&rsquo;Connor and Ms Sarah Treleaven.<\/p> <p>  As committee members will be aware, last week, the Minister for Health published the 2022 action plan, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023, which sets out the ongoing priorities to improve our health and social care services.  This report contains many different elements, but this year, the main focus of the reform involves addressing waiting lists and the very significant waiting list plan that we discussed on the previous occasion.  It is now being implemented across different aspects of the service.  It also includes further developments in shifting care to the community through our enhanced community care programme, significant recruitment and establishment of various teams in providing care outside of a hospital setting, which is a key element of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  There is also further investment in innovation and enhanced capacity in terms of additional employees into the service, as well as additional beds and access to care.  Implementing digitally held solutions aligns with the Government's recently published strategy.  It also introduces the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract.<\/p><p>In this respect, we hope to engage with the representative bodies over the next week or so on finalising the new contract.  We are focused on progressing the national elective ambulatory strategy through the provision of new elective capacity in Cork, Dublin and Galway, which is important for increasing the overall capacity of the system to provide more elective procedures for our citizens.  We are also focused on the realignment of acute and community services via regional health areas, RHAs, which we discussed at our previous meeting.  We can briefly set out the progress in this programme.<\/p><p> The 2022 waiting list action plan was launched on 25 February.  The plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and details 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists.  The immediate focus of the plan is to reduce active waiting lists for acute scheduled care by 18% this year.  If we can meet this projection, it will bring the number of people waiting to its lowest point in five years.<\/p><p> A waiting list task force has been established and is chaired by Mr. Reid and me.  We meet fortnightly.  A working group, comprising colleagues from the Department, the NTPF and the HSE, meets weekly to monitor progress and variance against waiting list plans, consider actions and identify issues to be elevated to the task force.<\/p><p> Overall, waiting lists are performing slightly ahead of the targets set out in the waiting action plan.  The first three or four months of the year were difficult due to Covid, the impact of which on the system was profound and reduced the amount of care that could be provided.  As of the end of April, both the outpatient and gastrointestinal, GI, scope waiting lists were performing ahead of target while inpatient day case waiting lists were marginally ahead.<\/p><p> We are maintaining the momentum behind the development and roll-out of the enhanced community care programme.  Mr. Reid will touch on this in some detail.  I will list the key achievements: 81 of 96 community health networks, CHNs, are now established; 21 of the 30 planned community specialist teams, CSTs, for older persons are established; 11 of the 30 CSTs for chronic disease management are established; 21 community intervention teams are now operational, with national coverage secured for the first time; and 139,000 diagnostic scans of various modalities were provided last year.  Regarding that last, significant progress has been made this year, with more than 75,000 scans by the end of April and a further 20,000 or so by the end of May.  We are on target for providing many more diagnostics in the community than we did last year, with a likely total of 200,000.  More than 1,200 whole-time equivalent staff have commenced their roles and a further 650 are at an advanced stage of recruitment.<\/p><p> The significant advance in GP access to diagnostics is an impressive performance from a standing start.  Every week, large numbers of people who would have turned up for hospital appointments are now receiving that care in the community setting through our older persons and chronic disease pathways.  This is real reform happening in practice on the ground for patients.<\/p><p> An individual population health profile has been created for each of the 96 CHNs, each containing standardised data on the demographics and health status of the relevant CHN.  This supports the identification of service needs down to a local level.  This profiling is an ongoing process and will lead to much better planning.  Initial external evaluations of the nine learning sites have highlighted a significant appetite for change among staff as well as positive feedback, particularly about the role played by GPs.<\/p><p> The Department of Health is progressing RHA implementation in partnership with the HSE and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We are designing six regions around the country where, rather than the system being funded on a siloed basis that separates community care and hospital care, health services will be co-ordinated around the needs of patients across all care settings.  This means that RHAs will serve one population in one region with one budget.  By aligning the services that we provide in each region, we will have the ability to see more clearly how a patient moves through our system from GP to hospital and back again.<\/p><p> The Government decision on RHA implementation, approved on 5 April, provides policy direction and a clear mandate for the RHA work programme.  Given that stakeholder consultation is critical for the success of this reform, regional workshops and other engagements are planned to input into the development of the implementation plan.  As was mentioned at our previous meeting, we are interested in receiving input from this committee and anyone else who wants to engage in the process.  We have an open mind about where we are going with the design.  There are many questions and we do not have a fixed view on them.  With our colleagues in the HSE and elsewhere, we are trying to figure out exactly how to implement the plan.<\/p><p> The Government remains committed to introducing the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract to hospital consultants as soon as possible.  The contract remains the subject of engagement with consultants' representative bodies.<\/p><p> The Government decision in December to implement a national strategy of elective care centres was shared with the hospital groups and individual hospitals and a programme business case has been developed for the elective centres in line with it.  The Government decision is to progress development of dedicated elective centres in Cork, Galway and Dublin and will provide elective care services for all of the population of Ireland.  Work has been continuing on the development of project-level preliminary business cases for Cork and Galway, including public spending code compliant analysis, to support the delivery of care centres in an agile manner.  These are expected to be finalised first, with the Dublin project business case being progressed in parallel.<\/p><p> The Department will continue to engage with the public and a range of stakeholders to further the goals of Sl&aacute;intecare in building a better, more equal healthcare system for our citizens.  These reforms build on one another and are progressing in tandem.  I am happy to engage with committee members on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, in particular the issue of regionalisation.  I wish to provide the committee with a summary update on three of the areas that we are progressing in Sl&aacute;intecare's implementation: RHAs; scheduled care; and the enhanced community care programme.<\/p> <p>  Since the last committee meeting on Sl&aacute;intecare, the Department of Health and the HSE have continued to progress the implementation of RHAs actively.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has also been involved in this work.  The detailed system and RHA design and the associated implementation plan, which sets out the key enabling work streams, and their objectives, milestones, activities and risks are being developed between the HSE and the Department of Health.  In addition to fortnightly meetings between the Department and the HSE, working groups have been established to examine  clinical corporate governance and accountability; finance, including population-based resource allocation; digital and capital infrastructure; people and development; change, communications and culture; and programme co-ordination.  Six different stakeholder engagements have already taken place, with further engagements planned.  In July, there will be further workshops with a wide range of stakeholders across the system at national, regional and local levels.  Before the end of July, regional workshops are planned for engaging with managers, clinicians and local leadership teams.<\/p> <p>  Tackling waiting lists is a key priority for the HSE and is included as one of six key priorities in the HSE Corporate Plan 2021-2024.  The corporate plan commits to delivering significant reductions in waiting lists and waiting times, working towards achieving the following Sl&aacute;intecare maximum waiting time targets by 2026: ten weeks for a first outpatient appointment; 12 weeks for an inpatient or day case procedure; ten weeks for a GI scope; and ten days for diagnostics.  The 2022 waiting list action plan has been jointly developed by the Department, the HSE and the NTPF and is being overseen by a waiting list task force, which is co-chaired by Mr. Watt and me.  The action plan sets out the following December 2022 maximum waiting time targets to ensure progress towards the Sl&aacute;intecare targets: 98% of patients waiting for their first outpatient appointments will be seen within 18 months and 100% will be seen within 36 months; 98% of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure will be treated within 12 months and 100% will be treated within 24 months; and 100% of patients waiting for GI scopes will be treated within 12 months.<\/p> <p>  The action plan is supported by dedicated funding of &euro;350 million, including &euro;150 million allocated to the NTPF and &euro;200 million allocated to the HSE.  The plan focuses on delivering significant additional activity in 2022 and building capacity within the system to address recurrent capacity gaps sustainably.  The plan commits to delivering 100,000 additional outpatient department appointments, 28,000 additional inpatient or day case procedures, 8,000 additional GI scopes and 30,000 additional diagnostics.  Detailed plans to deliver this activity have been developed.<\/p> <p>  Engagement continues across the delivery system, including with the NTPF, to identify all opportunities to deliver additional activity in 2022.  The plan seeks to progress longer term reform in order to address sustainably the recurrent capacity gaps that were identified in 2021 through a comprehensive waiting list demand and capacity analysis.  Significant planning has been undertaken to develop solutions and outline the requirements necessary to address the capacity gaps.<\/p> <p>  Investments in the healthcare budget for strategic reform initiatives such as enhanced community care are having a significant impact.  The programme was allocated &euro;240 million for the establishment of 96 CHNs, including 30 CSTs for older people and another 30 for people with chronic diseases, to provide integrated services for people nearer to home.  To date, more than 2,000 staff have been recruited or are at an advanced stage of recruitment, with more than 1,700 additional posts to be recruited for in 2022.  Eighty-one of the planned 96 CHNs, 21 of the CSTs for older persons and 11 chronic disease teams have been established to date.<\/p><p>From 2019 to 2022, an investment of &euro;210 million has been made available through the GP agreement to support eHealth and other modernisation initiatives and the roll-out of chronic disease management, CDM, programme to more than 430,000 people.  In early 2021, direct GP access to radiology services was implemented with five private providers, with approximately 140,000 radiology tests undertaken in 2021, which has assisted in reducing the demand on hospital services.  More than 94,000 scans have been carried out up to May 2022.  All of these developments in community services are being delivered with increased collaboration and partnership with voluntary providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for the presentations and for setting time aside to be with us.

I would have preferred a different option, probably a variant of options two and three, although that is obviously my own opinion.  Mr. Watt said we are setting a direction of travel, so all of these processes and structures which are put in place could evolve over time, which is fair enough.

I see on the map for Sl&aacute;intecare that it will be area A, which would contain Monaghan, Cavan, Meath, Louth and Dublin north.

The risks identified include that there is no local emergency department governance in Navan hospital, no acute surgical service in place, and an agency registrar, not a specialist in an emergency department, provides care in Navan.  There are significant issues relating to one of the smallest ICUs in the country.  Those risks have been highlighted to me as being significant by the chief clinical officer of the HSE, the clinical lead for acute services nationally, the anaesthesia specialists in the local hospitals, surgical specialist physicians, non-consultant hospital doctors and nursing staff.

I am trying to understand how this could work at a local level.  I can understand how at a regional level, you have a single management tier, which makes sense.  You want to align your CHO services with acute hospitals.  For me, it has to be more than an administrative alignment.  It has to be clinical and be about patient pathways.  I will give an example in my own constituency, which is the easiest one I can relate to.  We have a CHO manager, a hospital manager and at least one building, if not more than one if you take mental health as well, which is located on the grounds of University Hospital Waterford.  We have what is called a Dunmore wing, which is a unit housing a palliative care unit and acute beds, but we have different management layers making different decisions.  It is the same across acute care, where hospital management can find it very frustrating to get step-down and recovery beds and home help packages.  There are different management layers and different structures.  Can the witnesses tell me how this will improve because that is crucial for me?  Regarding what is happening in emergency departments and reducing waiting lists, sometimes the focus is too much on what is happening in the hospitals where we have to take two steps back and look at primary and community care as much.

All our focus in terms of looking at Sl&aacute;intecare and all the engagement we have had to date with all the stakeholders are on how this must be about the service.  It is not about structures.  It has to be an integrated service.  One issue we are seeing at local level even now is stronger integration between acute and primary services.

When we look at Sl&aacute;intecare in action, we are trying to ensure that people receive care as close to their home as possible to prevent them having to go into hospital and emergency departments.  The programme is around enhanced community care, which covers three chronic diseases - respiratory, cardiac and diabetes.  The integrated care programme for older persons, ICPOP, is about enabling older people to live within their communities.  I will give an example.  A gentleman aged 90 from east Galway, whose name is Ambrose, was not feeling well and was brought to a hospital just outside our region, which is Galway-Mayo-Roscommon.  He was sent to Tullamore.  The hospital discharged him because he needed medication and different follow up.  He was then seen by a consultant geriatrician.  He had a fall a few months later.  She met him in University Hospital Galway and out of that, he did not go into hospital but went to one of our community nursing units in Loughrea and got some respite, enhanced physiotherapy, occupational therapy and various clinical supports.  He was then discharged home, now has some home support and the nurses in the community look after him.  It is working really well.  We work very closely with the Saolta group in our community care centres as well.  Tomorrow we have what is called the joint enhanced community care governance group, which is co-chaired by Mr. Canavan and me.  There are various people on that, including clinicians.  We find out how we are doing regarding care.  For example, in April alone, the frailty at the front door programme saw 157 people.  We saved 375 bed days in April alone.  This stopped all those beds being taken up and these people were looked after in the community so it is working really well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Crehan-Roche"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that Ms Crehan-Roche and I have been working very closely on this for more than two years since both of us took up our posts because of the importance of integrating the services between the community and hospitals.  We have been trying to create the environment through which a enhanced community care programme can be rolled out successfully.  From a governance perspective, the key way we do it is, as Ms. Crehan-Roche pointed out, through the joint enhanced community care oversight group, which is jointly chaired by Ms. Crehan-Roche and me.  It has everybody you could imagine from the point of view of delivering services within and outside the hospital meeting in a forum.  It is quite a large and unwieldy forum but it is a great way for people to get to know each other and understand how their individual services work and how they can work together.  Ms Crehan-Roche has already given examples of how that is rolled out in real life.  We have other examples.  For example, we have good joint working arrangements in radiology.  Radiology is really important for a GP in determining whether a patient needs some further investigation or admission to hospital or otherwise.  If that can be ruled out, again, it avoids an unnecessary admission to hospital.  General X-Ray is available in the primary care centre in Castlebar.  It is a regular primary care centre with public health nurses and all the other staff you would expect to see in a primary care centre, along with GPs, but we also have a radiology facility there that allows for direct referral from GPs.  Patients are seen, have their images taken and a clinical decision can then be taken as to whether they need to be admitted to hospital or whether some other approach needs to be taken.  We are looking to roll that out in a number of other locations.  It is a key resource within the community.  If we can provide that kind of diagnostic capacity before the patient goes into hospital, it removes another reason for a patient to be sent to the emergency department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Canavan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Reid and Mr. Watt work with this committee over the next number of months as they evolve the policy in this area?

One main example of the integration is that there would no longer be the situation of delayed discharges with all of that expense being taken up with the hospital sector and no money in the community sector for home care.

I will make a couple of comments on accountability.  We are addressing this in a number of ways.  I have brought two papers to the board of the HSE about strengthening accountability in the HSE.  It is a factor and it comes up after every inquiry or every issue.  There are a number of things we will address, the first of which concerns the national incident reporting, NIR, process, which the committee will be familiar with.  When we carry out certain clinical reviews, and when we review cases that go wrong, we look at them and we tend to drift into describing what happened, and then we start a process of looking to see who did something that they should not have done.  This happens in sequence.  We are now making sure, because it is facilitated, that this is done in parallel.  It is not a \"gotcha\" process.  It is being done in a parallel process to see what happened, what went wrong, was someone accountable, or did somebody set out to do harm.  This will be run as a parallel process.<\/p> <p>  Separately, in the paper I brought to the board, we addressed the issue of accountability.  When we talk about accountability it is sometimes made very simple.  While I do not want to say it is complex, it is not that simple.  There are a number of factors around addressing accountability.  Clinical accountability is one factor, as is open transparency with the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.<\/p> <p>  Overall, we must look at performance management.  We are not strong enough in that area and it is not fully rolled out across the board.  We are in the process of rolling it out across the board.  There must be clear lines of responsibility.  We have delegated functions.  We need to make sure that in all of those delegated functions people are clear on what their role and responsibility is, and what they are delegated to do and not do.<\/p> <p>  We have brought a number of strands to this, including in the regulatory area to see what professions are regulated and what are not.  We are also looking to see what disciplinary process is in place.  Some of our disciplinary processes go back to the 1970s and they are not fit for purpose.  I would be open to challenge on that, but they are not.  Some people can vet who will oversee an investigation.  I do not believe this is right.  There are a number of strands we want to address in terms of accountability.

In terms of its core principles, the first is that there is an integrated service.  As Ms Crehan-Roche stated, it is that patients or users are getting care they need for their requirements closer to their home.  If they need different pathways, such as needing further care elsewhere having gone to a primary care centre, it is a more seamless process.  It is a handover rather than a hand-off experience for the patient.  There are many issues that have to be addressed to solve that but those are the core principles.<\/p> <p>  What will make the service better will be our continued investment in the community service to support acute services.  That does not mean there will not be investment in acute services.  We have to continue to increase bed capacity and put new pathways in emergency departments.  The improvement will relate to the enhancement of services such as primary care centres, for example.  Last week, I visited primary care centres with the teams of Ms Crehan-Roche and Mr. Canavan.  I saw an acute wing within a primary care centre where radiology services were taking place, with specialists from the acute services.  That was happening within the primary care centre.  Some of the referrals from that process happen within the primary care centre, such as in the context of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists or rehabilitation.  It is about that integrated service with fewer hand-offs, as well as an integrated management structure to ensure that is the way we operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>When is it expected that regionalisation will be fully implemented?

It is unacceptable in a public health system that junior doctors who have gone through the procedure of becoming qualified are being subjected to this pretty awful situation.

In some cases, people can use local injury units, which are in all areas, and also some primary care services.  However, people also need to go to emergency services.  We have been under extreme pressure since January across the board in our emergency departments.  We have a significant pressure in terms of presentations by older persons, which have required more multidisciplinary care.  In terms of discharges, we were significantly impacted between January and April by discharge processes for older persons into nursing homes and residential care settings because of outbreaks in nursing homes.  We have gone through an horrendous period.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned to some previous speakers, while the public have moved on from Covid, and I understand that because we all should move on, we still have 477 patients with Covid.

It is struck me last night that the emergency department in UHL is not confined to the area behind its sliding doors.  There are trolleys and parts of the department located in other corridors.  One part stretches between 60 or 70 yards from the accident and emergency department.  This is further evidence that the mid-west region funnels all of its acute needs through one major hospital.  The answer lies in having an elective hospital, as my colleague noted a moment ago, and beefing up capacity in Ennis hospital, St. John's Hospital in Limerick and Nenagh General Hospital.  We cannot keep funnelling people through UHL, whether that is through its accident and emergency environment or for people with acute needs and even inpatient appointments.  Otherwise, the system will eventually cave in, as has already happened several times this year.

He also told me, and this was news to me and I was shocked, that each hospital grouping operates its own discrete information system.

The person went through a plethora of tests, everything from blood tests and blood pressure tests to angiograms and so forth, and on the day of discharge a doctor said to the person as the doctor was taking up the chart, \"I did not realise until today that you also had cancer two years ago\".

However, there is very significant information sharing ongoing between the acute and community settings.  Some examples were expressed earlier, where a 91-year-old is getting his care in a co-ordinated way between the community services and the acute services.  Mr. Canavan has given some examples from the acute services as well.  However, we do not have an electronic health record, and that is a very significant gap in the delivery of healthcare in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  What we have done over the past couple of years is utilise the process of doing a vaccination programme to capture accurate information on the entire population to support us in that regard and for better information at an individual level.

It is something I have spoken about as far back as last November in the wake of what we had seen of Covid-19 at that stage.  I spoke particularly of the need to superimpose on the system a way of dealing with the health services generally similar to what we had done with Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions I wish to put.  I will take written answers but I will require specific written answers in each case.  To what extent has a profile been created in respect of each region throughout the country, regardless of location, whether it takes in cities or rural areas?  That is important if we are in the business of providing services to suit the region.<\/p> <p>  To what extent has the Health Service Executive worked on the creation of acceptable working conditions?  Over the past couple of years we have had references again and again to unacceptable or unattractive working conditions.  How have we addressed that?  Have we addressed it satisfactorily or sufficiently?  Do we have the answers?<\/p> <p>  I will speak to waiting lists and times.  I realise that we are speaking about proposals to be implemented and put in place in approximately two years.  Do we have the capacity to clear our waiting lists in those two years?  Before Covid-19 we had a waiting list system and that is why we have a really huge waiting list now.  Those lists have got longer.  What have we done in the meantime to reduce those waiting lists completely by emergency measures if necessary and remove them altogether inside of those two years?  Is that part of the process and how will it manifest?<\/p> <p>  We have received numerous complaints about mental health services in all our constituencies, with no exceptions.  This takes in both residential and emergency services, accommodation and treatment, which is just appalling in some areas.  To what extent have we addressed that particular issue, particularly community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 in my area?  The Chairman mentioned we should not be specific to the areas I represent and I do not intend to do so.  In parliamentary questions I do not address issues from a local standpoint but in order to deal with matters, we must show progress in all the local areas at the same time.  Otherwise, we are putting ourselves at a distance.<\/p> <p>  People in the regions must know what is going on.  To what extent has the structure improved, particularly the linkages between the regions and the HSE?  How is the process working now?  It was not working for many years.<\/p><p>When is the board of the HSE alerted to the concerns, overcrowding and the other issues that members have brought up at these meetings and people have brought to its attention?<br\/><br\/>I digress for a second in relation to the need for changes and the waiting times on trolleys.  A waiting time on a trolley, no matter where the trolley is located is of no benefit.  There is no benefit for the patient because the patient is still waiting.  Waiting for what?  It is like <i>Waiting for Godot<\/i>.  We need to get ahead of it, be out front of it and to be putting down the markers now.  Related to that, I had occasion in the past couple of weeks to intervene in a couple of very similar cases that represented patients waiting on trolleys for one, two, three, four and even five days.  At the end of that, the patient had to be removed from the public system and go to a private system where within three or four hours they had a bed and a full-scale diagnosis.  Nothing got done in the public system.  In fact, the patient had a serious condition.  I could mention the areas but I am not going to do that.  It could be any area.

How is the HSE board alerted to conditions in all hospitals, accident and emergency departments and whatever in all parts of the regions?  In other words, is the chain of command working in two directions, from the ground up and from the top down, or is it just a wait-and-see situation?  As was referenced earlier, what happens when cases go wrong?  How often are cases going wrong and what are we learning from them?  Are we putting in place measures to ensure that they are minimised?  That is a separate question and answer as well.  I have one last question.  What process is in place to ensure we are doing an adequate job in recruiting GPs for the various areas throughout the country, regardless of which region it is?  Again, there are numerous cases where we have difficulty replacing GPs, many of whom are retired, but some have left the service and system as well.

I will try to answer them because written replies to all of those will have the team tied up for a long time.  <\/p> <p>  On acceptable work conditions, we are very anxious to improve and strengthen the work conditions.  It is obviously a very difficult environment.  We are under pressures, particularly in hospitals, at the moment.  We have put in a number of supports for staff throughout Covid around the promotion of staff well-being.  I have been involved in communications, as has all the management team, about strengthening processes and supports for people in terms of well-being at work, but also basic facilities such as the canteen, etc., that have been and will continue to be strengthened.  Obviously, issues around working time is a key issue.<\/p> <p>  On waiting times and lists, we have a very significant plan.  Mr. Watt and I referenced in the opening statement the around &euro;350 million in the access to care fund, &euro;150 million of which is allocated to the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, but in respect of the remaining &euro;200 million, we have put in place plans on recurring and non-recurring activity costs to help each of the hospital groups around addressing some of that.  Importantly, there are about 37 pathways to change how people get their services and move some of them move into the community to stop numbers coming onto the waiting lists in the manner in which they are.  It is a very significant plan that has been published and I am happy to share it.<\/p> <p>  I might just ask my colleague to comment on the mental health service in a moment.  <\/p> <p>  I just want to reassure the Deputy about our board.  We report to the board on a monthly basis.  We have what is called a scorecard, which goes onwards to the Minister after every board meeting.  That is a report on all aspects of our national service plan and performance against each of the targets in the plan.  That includes emergency departments and patient waiting times.  The performance delivery of our board is reviewed on a monthly basis by a subcommittee and it is reviewed by our full board.  There are very clear linkages between what happens on the ground and us providing assurances to our board, including on patient waiting times.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on the last couple questions.  GP recruitment is a difficult issue.  We are working with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, to strengthen the number of trainees coming through and the number of GP trainee posts over a three, four or five-year period.  I think this year we have about an extra 41 posts going through for GPs, which is a start.<\/p> <p>  I will take a final question on what happens when things go wrong.  We have a serious incident management process within the health service.  We have various processes, including NIR process as well, that looks at where harm is caused or something went wrong and sets out recommendations.  As I said earlier, we have certain ways of progressing both learning from it and addressing some of the issues that emerged.  I just wish to reassure the Deputy.  I hope we have saved my team a number of written reports on that for the next few weeks.  I know I have been brief in my answers but I am trying.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps my colleague, Ms O&rsquo;Connor, will speak on mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I might actually ask Ms O&rsquo;Neill because she has the details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>On mental health services, I will link some earlier questions on the population modelling in mental health services.  A couple of years ago we took an approach working with our population health colleagues and international deprivation modelling where we actually applied a resource allocation adjusted for deprivation and rurality to the mental health funding, which recognised the types of issues that the Deputy is pointing to.  For example, the Deputy&rsquo;s area of community healthcare organisation, CHO 7, would have had a huge population increase and some very specific deprivation-related increase need that resulted in increased allocation for mental health services in CHO 7.  We have done that over a number of years since 2015.  Where we receive new funding, we try to orient it towards what we know is imbalance in relation to population-based available services.  We try to raise all boats to the same level where we can and account for anomalies.  That has resulted in some particular additional funding for CHO 7 services within the available overall allocation that comes to us annually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#N01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

The thing is that the six regions are rather substantial, so there is work going on at community healthcare network, CHN, level, a more localised level, to understand the specific needs of each locality.  By the end of this summer we will have very comprehensive profiles of all of the regions, not just in terms of population demographics, but we are also looking at the health and social care staff across each region.  In addition, there are colleagues looking at the infrastructure and facilities in each region.  They will be completed towards the end of the summer and in quarter 3 we will make them publicly available.  I think we probably need a web resource perhaps with a bit of mapping going on.  That might be helpful alongside publications.  They are essential across the various work streams that are going on to support regional health areas, RHAs.  Ms Treleaven explained how important it would be for allocation of finances in a fair way.  The Deputy can see from what Ms O&rsquo;Neill said that we have experience in handling things such as rurality and deprivation.  We will borrow from other Departments where they have invested huge expertise in those areas.  It is a big part of our work and we look forward to sharing it as we progress.

Rather, it is a realignment of the services and strengthening of many of their elements, particularly those where patient safety issues have been highlighted to us.  The Deputy attended the briefing.  The chief clinical officer of the HSE, the clinical lead for acute services nationally and the anaesthetists, physicians and surgeons at the local hospital have highlighted to us their concerns about patient safety.  As CEO of the HSE, I cannot ignore the risks that have been raised with us.  I have to implement mitigations to address them.  They are significant risks.  For example, there is no local emergency department governance or acute surgical service on site at Navan and it is not an accredited hospital for recruiting individuals with those skills.  We have to realign the services so that they provide the best safety and protect people's lives.<\/p> <p>  Regarding timelines, we are working on what steps need to be taken next.

While we all accept Meath has become more populated and that certain parts of the county are growing, many specialties do not exist in Navan &ndash; nephrology, neurology, infectious diseases and sufficient ICU cover.

I will mention some of them because it is important we put a little balance into this morning's debate.  A number of projects and programmes have been used and tested as regards safety and effectiveness in reorienting acute care away from emergency departments, EDs.  I am aware of a couple of them.  The community paramedicine project is in operation in the Border region, where community paramedics provide care to ensure unnecessary ambulance journeys to EDs are reduced.  Apparently, research there has shown that 85% of all patients served did not have to go to an ED.  That is a major section of the patient group.<\/p> <p>  The pathfinder project is another.  It covers Beaumont Hospital in north County Dublin, which sees advanced paramedics, physical therapists and occupational therapists attend older, low acuity 999 callers in their homes to ensure they do not have to be transported to Beaumont accident and emergency.  In other cases, I am aware of paramedics calling to older people, where people are informed their mother or father would be better off staying at home.  Paramedics do that test.  A study of that project found that of 527 callers, 69% were supported to remain home and kept out of the ED.<\/p> <p>  The last project is the emergency department in the home service.  St. Vincent's University Hospital ambulance service allows patients referred to it by a GP or through a 999 call from a nursing home to be assessed by an ED doctor and an occupational therapist at home.  According to that project's figures, of 3,137 patients treated over the course of eight months in 2020, 2,909 remained in their homes, saving the hospital a massive 7.9 years of bed days.  That saves millions and creates capacity and efficient pathways of care.<\/p> <p>  What is the HSE view of these programmes?  We have heard about some of them this morning.  These programmes appear to be successful.  What plans are there to roll out those services?  We have regionalisation.  These are issues coming from different areas, including hospitals and whatever else.  How are these programmes rolled out, duplicated and made common practice?  One of the very important areas we do not focus enough on are the things we get right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#P00700","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I welcome the Chairman's comments about trying to bring some balance into it.

It is difficult to get public interest through the media in some of these successes but they are there.

That would be useful, outside of a committee session in which is more difficult to tease out all of the issues.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a few questions to Mr. Reid on waiting lists and presentation of them, capture of data and reducing waiting lists.  At the moment, the National Treatment Purchase Fund only publishes acute waiting lists.  We have to go through parliamentary questions to get access to data on diagnostic waiting lists and CHO waiting lists.  Given that we will have an alignment of areas in acute hospitals, can it be looked at that we have better capture of that data rather than having to go through parliamentary questions?  Some of Mr. Reid's staff can be critical of us putting in too many parliamentary questions.  It would be better if we had access to information.  The NTPF data, when it is presented every couple of weeks, is very useful.  It shows what is going up and down and what is working and not working.  We do not have the same data for diagnostics and community.  Can that be looked at?<\/p> <p>  I got a parliamentary question response yesterday on the validation of acute hospital waiting lists, as opposed to people who are treated or seen.  I was not able to get the response on diagnostics or community because it is not captured but we were able to get the information on acute hospital waiting lists.  As far as I can see, 80,000 people were removed from the hospital waiting lists last year as a process of validation.  So far this year it is just over 30,000, if I am right.  I do not oppose that because the system needs to be brought up to date.  If there is a validation process that makes it more fit for purpose and we have real data, that is important.  However, in the presentation of the data, it is important we can see what is happening, who is being treated and seen and who is removed as a consequence of a validation.  We need to watch how we do that.  My understanding is letters are issued to patients as to whether or not they are still in need of healthcare.  However, sometimes people move addresses, there can be issues or complications where people do not respond to a letter and are then taken off a list.  We see it in housing and it becomes a particular challenge, as I am sure the Chair and other members of the committee will be aware.  I would not want to see it happen in healthcare unnecessarily that people fall off the list.  Can Mr. Reid confirm those figures on the validation process?<\/p><p>Also, can he answer the question as to whether it is something that can be improved upon in terms of the presentation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund figures, both in terms of community diagnostics and validation versus patients seen, because the more information we have the better for all of us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022061500002#Q01000","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I agree that there is a great deal of data.

It is opportune with the recent announcement of the &euro;30 million funding programme for postmasters.  We have lodged our statement but I will touch on a few salient points and then take questions.<\/p> <p>  Throughout Covid-19 there were many examples of individuals and organisations that redefined the essence of public and community service.  Of particular note has been the contribution of An Post both with the post office network and our delivery infrastructure.  Throughout the pandemic, An Post kept its network of 920 post offices open.  At any one time two or three small offices were closed but reopened again within three or four days.  This was important in providing cash payments to citizens who still opted to have their social welfare payments paid through cash.  It was also important in terms of the continued distribution of cash to the economy.  We kept all our delivery routes open.  This was important in keeping Ireland trading during the lockdown and enabling SMEs to keep their doors open.  We welcome the recent announcement on the three-year funding package for postmasters in recognition of the real community value of post offices but also of the great public service. <\/p> <p>  In regard to An Post's own strategy, we take our lead from the Government's own programme for Government.<\/p><p>We are really well positioned to meet the Government objectives of keeping communities connected, protecting societal well-being, supporting the green economy and delivering accessible financial services for all.  The pandemic, however, has accelerated some of the headwinds facing the post office network.  It is important to recognise that today.  While the &euro;30 million in funding for payments to postmasters is very welcome, it should not detract from the job that remains to transform the post office, as I always explain to people, away from the old world of cash payments, BillPay, etc., and into a new world of financial services and e-commerce.  That is not to say the \"old world\" of cash payments is not important, but we know that it is a part of the business and a part of the income stream for postmasters that is declining.  Covid has accelerated some of these underlying trends.  The strategy we put in place in 2018 and 2019 is still very much robust and intact, but Covid has accelerated some of that decline.  The big one is social welfare.  Since 2019 we have seen about 5.5 million transactions come out of the network.  We very much welcomed the announcement from the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, before Christmas on returning some jobseeker payments to the post office, but it remains the case that the number of those social welfare transactions in the network is way down on what we had envisaged.  We are working all the time.  Our big mantra for the team is to look constantly for new products and services that we can put through the network.  We are constantly looking to top up the leaky bucket, as I call it.  We are doing that based on four key pillars.<\/p><p> The first is community banking.  Community banking is absolutely key to the future of the post office network in the context of the retreat of the pillar banks from many of our towns.  An Post is now the sole provider of financial services in many parts of the country.  There are 540 post offices situated in parts of the country where there is no bank within a 5 km radius.  Our new partnership with Bank of Ireland, which began last year, is great, and we continue to work in partnership with AIB.  Our An Post Money goes from strength to strength.  The retreat of some of the big-name banks from the market in the next 12 to 18 months has created an opportunity for An Post.  Our current account is going from strength to strength.  That is up 77% year on year.  We are working very much in partnership with some of the exiting banks right down to branch level, where we are partnering the branch managers with the local postmasters and creating that warm transfer of customers.  With the current account we were at about a 50:50 split between account openings online and in the network.  That has now shifted, with about 65% of current account openings being in the network.  That shows the role of post offices working with the exiting banks to warm-transfer customers and to let them open accounts in a timely fashion, which is not the case with some other providers in the marketplace.  Then there is our NTMA business, which continues to go from strength to strength.<\/p><p> The second pillar is looking for new services.  There is our Green Hub and our partnership with SSE Airtricity.  That has kicked back in post pandemic and is starting to gain traction again.  I am really pleased to say that our technical development has now kicked off on Leap and we will be able to do Leap purchase and top-up in post offices across the country from quarter 1 of next year.  The one-stop shop for government services is still, I think, something we collectively need to crack.  The Government recently produced the digital Ireland framework and, within that, the Government's goal is to have 90% of services online by 2030.  It is really important that, over the next 18 months to two years, we work collectively.  In the past we have gone around various Government Departments piecemeal looking for extra government services.  We now need to stand back, take an all-government approach and ask how we can truly become the one-stop shop for the Government in support of the various Government policy documents that have been published, including the digital framework, rural development, etc., such that a citizen can go to the post office and avail of any government service, which may involve identity verification, planning applications or payment for government services.  We have the IT infrastructure.  Our IT infrastructure links in with the Department of Social Protection and Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank, which shows that it is state-of-the-art infrastructure.  Collectively, we need to find a way around this.  We look forward to working with the Government on that because three years will pass quickly, the payment to postmasters will run out and we need new services, including government services, coming in behind that.<\/p><p> I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022061500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Debbie Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Byrne.<\/p> <p>  As a matter of housekeeping, Senator Dooley sends his apologies.

It is good to see the witnesses again.  I welcome that there has been some progress since we last met.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on the last point Ms Byrne made about how An Post would like to see things unfold now in respect of engagement.  There is a process to work its way out in respect of the potential government services and a one-stop shop and what that might look like.  Are negotiations ongoing?  At every committee meeting I attend there is call for a whole-of-government approach.  The difficulty with whole-of-government approaches is that they are difficult.  I ask the witnesses to give me a sense of where we are at and the type of progress that is being made or not being made.  Do the witnesses feel there is a need for a different approach to the engagement in the first instance?  From their perspective, is the potential that is there for identification?  Is it less for social welfare or is it still for social welfare?  I would like just a sense of the types of services the witnesses see as a potential.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses expand on the point about the Green Hub?  I am my party's climate spokesperson.  There is a huge budget to go with the retrofitting programme.  SSE Airtricity, I think, is one of the five one-stop shops.  On a practical basis, what is the working relationship between An Post and SSE Airtricity?  How does that look, and what is the opportunity to penetrate into communities in a way in which online does not for the retrofitting programme?<\/p> <p>  I have a final question about the allocation of the new moneys.  What is the formula for that?

We welcomed that the Minister and her officials were able to get to this stage so early in the year in the agreement on the funding.  We also now recognise there is an urgency in communicating the dispersal model.  It is fine that postmasters know there is &euro;30 million, but everybody wants to know what is in it for them.

There was talk, I think, of somebody from the Department of Finance being there, but I have not seen the names.<\/p><p>I literally only got that into my inbox last night, so we can confirm that.<\/p><p> In terms of Government services, the outstanding memo still needs to be published out of the last round of engagement in terms of the old approach where all of the Secretaries General came together and looked at what their respective Departments could provide.  I have not seen that memo.  My understanding is that not too much has come out of it.  At the IPU conference two weeks ago, the Minister for Social Protection stated that she and her officials were looking at what social welfare services could be provided.  Anywhere there is paper, there must be a role for the post office.  For example, social welfare recipients must notify the Department of Social Protection when they go on holiday.  Why can this not be done at the post office counter?  The Minister is working with her officials to look at that.<\/p><p> On the new approach, the digital framework document has been published.  There is also a reference in the programme for Government to reform and local government.  Having got the funding piece over the line, my next step is to stand back and ask how we approach that.  We will need some kind of committee obviously with our own Department at the heart of it but also perhaps work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach because for something to be a whole-of-government approach, and the Deputy will know better than I do, those two Departments will probably have to have some skin in the game in terms of directing that because it crosses local government.  If you are doing something in post offices, you are replacing services provided elsewhere, etc.  My objective this summer is to plan the approach with a view to kicking it off in September.<\/p><p> When we launched the green hub in the October before the onset of Covid, we were ahead of the curve.  What consumers were telling us at the time was that it was all very complicated.  For example, if they wanted to do up their house, they had to go to the SEAI website and all the rest of it and bring all the information together themselves.  What we did was simplify the process and bring everything into the green hub, which is a portal on the An Post website.  We brought together and simplified some of the SEAI information.  We then plugged in SSE Airtricity as a provider.  Consumers can book an appointment where an SSE Airtricity evaluator will visit their home, assess it and see what jobs need to be done.  During Covid, we did some assessments remotely with an iPad, which worked quite well, so now we give people the option of availing of both routes.  Consumers get an estimate and a shopping list so they can decide to go the whole hog in terms of a deep retrofit or cherry pick off of that.  In conjunction with the European Investment Bank, we launched a green loan, which is still has the lowest rate in the marketplace for green financing.  We would like to scale that, and we have been talking to other providers about coming on board in order that we have partners in addition to SSE Airtricity.<\/p><p> The SEAI came out with its one-stop-shop arrangement at the beginning of the year.  We have had to stand back a bit and see where we can play a role.  It is a really good example where we invested a lot of time and energy.  We are very close to the consumer and are outside the tent on this, which is very frustrating because I think we could help Government accelerate that.  We are part of Government but we are not so I think we can do more in that space.  Again, I would ask that when policy things like this happen, people would ask about the position of An Post, because, for the minute, we probably have to re-evaluate our strategy in light of that.  We are in discussions with SEAI to see whether there is a role for us.  We have invested in the digital infrastructure and could be the front end of that and bring SSE Airtricity in through the Government route.  Why does the Government need to replicate and spend money again creating a digital front end for consumers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022061500002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Debbie Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>That is the point I was going to make.

I had to attend a vote in the Seanad.  If I ask questions that were already asked, I apologise in advance.  I was tracking the meeting until I had to go off to vote.  I thank Ms Byrne for her opening statement.  I am conscious that this is our third engagement on the retail post office network in the past month or so.  We had the IPU appear before the committee and also had the Minister of State in on foot of the announcement of the funding programme, and so on.  There is probably some repetition of points we made previously but I want to hear An Post&rsquo;s perspective on them.<\/p> <p>  Ms Byrne referred to an investment by An Post of more than &euro;60 million to transform the post office network to build a sustainable business for postmasters.  Where did that &euro;60 million actually go and what did it do?<\/p> <p>  My next question may have already been touched on by the Chairman.  What formula was used in each of the three years?  The phrase used to describe this was the \"dispersal\" method or model.<\/p><p>It is to give it to those who need it most, not those who are already thriving without it and so on.  Where does Ms Byrne see the cash versus digital scenario going?  That genie is out of the bottle and people are now much more willing to tap than they ever were before.  They are much more willing and less reluctant to embrace technology.  There was this whole cash-only thing, which I would have seen happen in my own post office.  People used to go in to collect their pension and then paid their bills with the cash they got from the pension.  They would then walk across to the other side of the shop and spend the rest of it over the counter buying their groceries before they went home.  The cash kind of moved around within the building but never actually went anywhere.  That can now be done differently.<\/p><p> Obviously, broadband is part of this committee's remit as well.  The unintended consequences of improved broadband may mean that people will be able to access some of the services online that they cannot get at the moment because they do not have broadband and they will stop going to the post office for them.  Where does Ms Byrne see that going?<\/p><p> Has Ms Byrne an idea of the percentage of the population that engages with An Post on either a weekly or monthly basis?  I remember that Postbank kind of came and went.  There is another service available now, although I am not that familiar with the An Post current account.  Ms Byrne might enlighten me on that.<\/p><p> Ms Byrne made a reference to making online shopping easier, including by means of out-of-hours collections.  What is involved in that?  Obviously, people can still presumably top up their Leap cards at DART stations and on Luas platforms, but it is welcome that An Post also offers this service.  I was taken by Ms Byrne's phrase about the leaky bucket whereby stuff is coming in and going back out and we are always plugging holes.  The An Post brand is really important.  It is really trusted - possibly more than the pillar banks or the commercial financial services sector generally.  An Post should build on that and provide more services.  The in-person verification stuff is very useful.  I do not really understand why we set up a whole load of driving licence offices when we could possibly have done them through the post offices - not all 920 offices but perhaps 200 or 300 could have done it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022061500002#F03300","speaker":"1696","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>The top 250 or something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022061500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Debbie Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I just wonder why we are duplicating services, particularly those that involve in-person transactions.

First, online shopping, with people either collecting or returning a parcel, is driving in new footfall, which is why we have invested heavily in commercial training with postmasters.  If that footfall is driven in, postmasters and postmistresses then have to find a way to sell.

In my opinion, a political leaflet, regardless of the party, is not junk mail but rather is a way of communicating with people and getting a message across.  It is almost impossible to get leaflets distributed in any other way and there is a massive market, with 949 local authority seats and probably quadruple that in terms of candidates.
