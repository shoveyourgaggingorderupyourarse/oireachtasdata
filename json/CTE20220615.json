The importance of wind and offshore energy has only grown with time.  It is vital that we harness these sources in the right way.  The climate action plan sets out a target of 5,000 MW of offshore wind electricity by 2030.  Events in recent years and months, such as the war in Ukraine and climate change, have highlighted the importance of utilising these sources of energy.  Ireland is particularly well placed, especially around the west coast, to avail of wind energy, and we need to take this opportunity so we can have a real and positive impact in achieving our climate action goals.  Job creation in this area is something we hope to see grow and prosper and I hope the witnesses can inform the committee about this.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased we have the opportunity to consider the matter further with the following representatives.  I welcome from Wind Energy Ireland Mr. Noel Cunniffe, CEO, and Mr. Justin Moran, director of external affairs.  I welcome Ms Vanessa O'Connell, head of Inis Offshore Wind and vice-chairperson of the offshore supply chain working group.

I am joined by my colleagues: Mr. Justin Moran, director of external affairs; Ms Vanessa O&rsquo;Connell, head of Inis Offshore Wind and vice-chairperson of our offshore supply chain working group; and Mr. Kieran Ivers, CEO of Green Rebel.  Wind Energy Ireland represents the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential part of our low carbon energy future.  It is important to emphasise that we represent the whole supply chain.  As might be expected, our members manufacture turbines, develop projects and operate wind farms.  They also include Irish engineering, transport, surveying and planning companies.  Together, our industry employs approximately 6,000 people.  For us, it is not enough that we develop the 5,000 MW of offshore wind energy set out in the climate action plan and the even greater potential in the deeper waters off our south and west coasts.  We want to see Irish wind farms creating jobs in Ireland, supporting Irish businesses, providing training and education opportunities for Irish workers, and growing a thriving new industry.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by briefly telling the committee the story of two countries, Ireland and Scotland.  Ireland&rsquo;s only existing offshore wind farm, Arklow Bank, became operational in 2004, nearly two decades ago.  It consists of seven wind turbines and, at the time, it was one of the largest offshore wind farms in Europe.  It was the first time a wind turbine with a generating capacity of 3 MW was ever installed anywhere in the world and it is still operating today.  I would ask members to consider this for a moment; at one time Ireland was at the cutting edge of offshore wind energy and then we stopped.  It was a full three more years before the first Scottish offshore wind farm started generating electricity but Scotland did not stop.  As of 2019 there were 4,700 people employed in Scotland&rsquo;s offshore wind sector and it contributed nearly &pound;1 billion to the Scottish economy.  Today, there is almost 2,000 MW of offshore wind operational in Scotland and another 8,400 MW in construction or advanced development.  It is no surprise that in 2020 renewable energy provided 97% of Scotland&rsquo;s power.  Put simply, in the 2000s we did not take advantage of an enormous opportunity and I am here today to ask for the support of committee members to ensure we do not make the same mistake again.<\/p> <p>  With climate change and the crisis in Ukraine there is an even more urgent responsibility to transform our energy system to one that is clean, secure and equitable, while protecting our marine environment and securing the confidence of fishing and coastal communities.  Offshore wind will deliver greater energy security; it is the key to our energy independence.  With the right approach - with Government, industry and coastal communities working together - we can build a new industrial sector, supporting regional development, creating thousands of jobs and driving sustainable growth.  Other European countries, like Poland and Britain, have put in place an industrial strategy and a sector deal between the domestic offshore industry and those Governments.  These bring together the offshore renewables industry and the relevant state agencies and Government departments to maximise the value of the industry domestically for clean growth, which includes a strong focus on building the domestic supply chain.  We want a sector deal for Ireland but first we need to ensure our port infrastructure is ready.<\/p><p> In May 2020, we published an analysis called Harnessing our Potential.  It was produced by the Carbon Trust, which is a leading UK-based consultancy.  Harnessing our Potential is still the most comprehensive analysis to date of Ireland's offshore supply-chain potential.  It included a thorough examination of Irish ports and harbours.  Ports have two key roles in supporting offshore wind energy.  They can serve as an operations and maintenance base for an offshore wind farm.  Larger ports with extensive infrastructure can provide construction or marshalling services.  Several Irish harbours are suitable as operations and maintenance bases.  Members of this committee may be aware that two of our members, namely, Codling Wind Park and SSE with its Arklow Bank Wind Park, have already announced that if their projects are successful that they will use Wicklow and Arklow harbours, respectively, as their bases.<\/p><p> Each base translates to approximately 80 full-time jobs.  Each base is normally accompanied by extensive investment in local services and port infrastructure.\u00a0 However, when it comes to construction and marshalling services, at present the only port on the island of Ireland can do this, which is Belfast Harbour.  The facilities at Belfast are first class but we will need much more.  We cannot deliver our offshore energy ambitions from a single port.<\/p><p> It is important that members appreciate that if projects cannot find suitable available ports in Ireland, they can, and will, build from ports on the west coast of Britain, from France and even from the Netherlands.  Some of these ports already engage with our projects.  Irish wind farms could create jobs in Cherbourg and support businesses in Rotterdam.  As we stated in May 2020, strategic investment must be directed urgently into Irish ports to enable them to build the infrastructure needed to support the construction of offshore wind energy.  We are currently carrying out a new analysis of existing port infrastructure and the expansion plans to meet the needs of offshore renewables that a number of these ports are bringing forward.  We will complete this analysis over the summer and I look forward to sharing it with the committee then.<\/p><p> As well as an infrastructure gap, we face a skills gap.  For example, we will need hundreds of new wind-turbine technicians.  Right now, with the support of Skillnet Ireland, we train between ten to 20 people every year with our partners in Green Tech Skillnet.   In addition, a turbine technician apprenticeship programme in Kerry awaits validation but these initiatives will not be enough.  Already we have seen our members and State bodies struggle to recruit ecologists, marine biologists and planners.  We will literally need thousands of civil, electrical and marine engineers.<\/p><p> I spoke to colleagues from the British and Scottish offshore wind energy industry at an Enterprise Ireland event last week.  I was struck by how they too have identified a shortage in skills and personnel as one of their most significant challenges.  Last year, the expert group on future skills needs published the Skills for  Zero Carbon report and I will highlight a small number of its recommendations.  The report recommended co-ordinated planning for training within the renewable energy sector through partnerships between Government, industry and training providers, the prioritising of training for jobs in renewable energy that are set to be in high demand, including marine planners, turbine technicians, hydrogen specialists and other technical roles, the expansion of existing maritime training to meet demand from the offshore energy sector and engagement with the fishing community to give people with experience working at sea the option to transfer into the offshore wind sector.  The report concluded by noting \"Given the urgency of meeting Ireland&rsquo;s climate action goals, it is crucial that ... these recommendations are prioritised ... and are centrally driven by Government ... working in close collaboration with industry and the education and training system.\"  We fully endorse the report and urge the committee to support the establishment of this implementation group, as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> It is important to acknowledge several significant recent positive initiatives that have been taken by the Government.  Late last year, the Department of Transport published an updated policy statement that set out a strategy for commercial ports to facilitate offshore renewable energy.  The Department also worked successfully with other EU member states to amend the Connecting Europe Facility criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for offshore wind.  This initiative has enabled some Irish ports to apply for that funding to expand for servicing offshore wind energy but not all.   The Department has also established a port co-ordination group to discuss issues around port <\/p><p> We would like to welcome the establishment of the cross-departmental offshore wind delivery task force, which will include a focus on supply-chain issues.  Our industry would welcome the opportunity to join the task force and work together to ensure that there is a determined focus on maximising the economic benefits of offshore wind energy to Ireland.  Finally, I commend the efforts of Enterprise Ireland in particular, which last week launched an Irish offshore wind supply-chain cluster called the Gael Offshore Network.  The network consists of more than 65 Irish companies, including many of our members.<\/p><p> Irish businesses are already getting ready for Ireland's offshore renewable energy potential and some are starting to compete internationally.  We have enough offshore wind power to power this country and export energy as both electricity and green hydrogen.  The need is there and the potential is there.  If Irish ports and businesses are not able to take advantage of this opportunity, then there is no doubt that others will step in.  The chance to develop a skills base and an industry that can compete internationally in a rapidly growing global renewable energy market will be lost.  This is the time for Ireland to seize the opportunity, and bring together industry, policymakers and communities to ensure these multi-billion euro investments in zero-carbon generation create thousands of skilled jobs at home, and regenerate coastal communities right around the island.  We need to unite industry, Government, the relevant State agencies, and our fishing and coastal communities behind a shared vision for true energy independence and the creation of a thriving offshore renewable energy industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunniffe.

I am happy to share a copy of the report with members after the meeting.  We represent a large number of members with commercial interest in floating wind energy projects.  Many of these projects are developing to compete for 2030 and deliver as part of the phase 2 process for Government.  Phase 1 will be an initial phase of offshore wind energy development, which will include five projects located off the east coast and one project off the west coast.<\/p> <p>  Floating wind energy is a huge opportunity for Ireland's south and west coasts.  We believe that in order for floating wind energy to develop during this decade then there will need to be specific pot within the second renewable electricity support scheme auction for offshore renewables.  At the moment this has not yet been decided upon.  There was a Government consultation on that a few months and we expect to hear the results very soon.  The reason that this sector will need its own pot in the middle of the decade is that floating wind energy this decade will not be able to compete directly on price with fixed-bottom offshore wind energy, which will be the predominant technology that will be developed off our coasts this decade.  We believe that despite not being able to compete economically just yet, they will become economically competitive in the 2030s.  For Ireland, particularly off our west coast, there is an enormous potential for floating offshore wind energy as we transition to overall energy independence.  So we feel that it would be a worthwhile investment by the State to invest and allow some floating offshore wind energy projects to connect by 2030 in order that we can take those learnings and start to bring in the supply chain and develop that within Ireland.  While this is nascent technology in many countries around Europe, the supply chain is not yet there so we have not lost that opportunity yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This technology then is specifically for the west and south coasts of Ireland and it will be fixed-bottom wind energy for the east coast.

For the west coast potential, generally speaking there are limited areas that are suitable for the development of fixed-bottom turbines so it will be floating offshore wind off our west coast.

He will understand that people on the coast have an interest in how close a wind farm will be to them.  It is my understanding that fixed-bottom wind farms can be located so far out that they will not impinge on the view, but there is also a belief that, since they have to be closer in than floating wind farms, it would be better to wait until the floating technology was ready.  I do not agree, as the time for this is now, but the view has been expressed to me that we should perhaps wait until the floating technology is a little more developed.  Is it correct to say that fixed-bottom technology is fairly developed, is in place elsewhere and can be located far offshore?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#B00600","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Exactly.  There are approximately 25 GW of offshore wind energy deployed in the world right now, and almost all of it is fixed-bottom.

Even off the east coast, Irish waters get very deep very quickly.  As such, deploying fixed-bottom technology is the right approach to take.<\/p> <p>  We represent floating wind energy members as well as fixed-bottom wind energy members.  The floating wind energy community says that we need to establish a supply chain in Ireland and get offshore wind going right now so as to harness and take advantage of the floating wind energy opportunity fully.

The challenge is that it is our members that are developers rather than our members that are ports that will be setting out the specifications for what they would like to see in a port, for example, pier length and water depth.  There is something that we can bring to the table in terms of discussing our needs and readiness, which is one of the reasons that we commissioned the report that Mr. Cunniffe mentioned in his opening statement.  In that all-island report, we identified 13 ports north and south of the Border and investigated what port infrastructure existed right now to construct and marshal an offshore wind farm.  It also considered what could be in place in two or three years' time if ports like Rosslare and Shannon Foynes delivered on their infrastructural development plans.  We have been happy to support those plans in terms of their applications to the Connecting Europe Facility.  I hope that, when we bring the report to members of this committee, we will have a much clearer understanding of what is in place and what needs to be in place.

They are not just people who are installing the turbines, but also planners, hauliers and the entire supply chain, including people working in financial institutions across the country.  We have commissioned a report, entitled \"Harnessing our potential: Investment and jobs in Ireland's offshore wind energy\", which I referenced in my opening statement.  It examined Ireland's old target for offshore renewable energy, which was 3.5 GW.  We have since increased that to 5 GW.

I was involved in development, construction and operations.  Something that I saw that was a success and that has since become a platform for growth of offshore wind and ensured that the benefits of offshore wind energy are harvested for the UK was a sector deal that was signed in 2019.  Effectively, it was a partnership between the British Government and industry.  It was a handshake whereby industry and the British Government were committing to actions in terms of delivering offshore wind energy in the UK.  At the time, the target was to deliver 30 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.  That target has since been accelerated to 50 GW.  In terms of the industry, part of that was to be 60% local content.  This was not a mandatory target, but a vision that the industry committed to working towards together.<\/p> <p>  There is an opportunity in Ireland that is not just about the green electrons, but about creating a whole new industry that can benefit the people of Ireland and generate many jobs.

In terms of working together, we welcome the offshore wind energy task force that has been established by the Government, but let us bring the industry to the table and work together in collaboration more frequently.

They are all coming forward with proposals, ideas and plans and the cost of each of them will vary because some ports have different levels of infrastructure in place.  In terms of a ball park figure, we are talking about tens of millions of euro but the actual figure will vary from project to port to port.

We hope to start construction in 2025 or 2026 at the outside so the question for us is whether ports other than Belfast will be ready then for those projects.  Belfast will be able to take some of that work.  It is a first-class facility but it cannot build six Irish offshore wind farms at the same time.  If those ports are not ready, those projects will be looking to other ports and other infrastructure opportunities to provide the construction marshalling services.

They are landed there and taken to the wind farms.<\/p> <p>  We are not here to pick a port winner.  There will be enough work in the development of offshore wind energy in Ireland to provide opportunities for every significant port in this country.  Even for some smaller ports and harbours, there are opportunities for them to be operations and maintenance bases.  When we look at the west coast in particular, and as the Senator noted, the wind speeds out there are fantastic, it is not just about the opportunity to construct, marshal, operate and maintain those projects.  We can be innovators and leaders out there because we will be developing offshore wind energy in some of the windiest parts and deepest waters of the world and we can take the skills we develop there, and I do not know if Mr. Ivers would like to come in on this because I know it is an area in which Green Rebel has worked, and take them around the world and compete internationally.  One of the things we want to get across here is that if we can build an Irish supply chain to support Irish offshore wind farms, there is no reason those Irish companies will not be building wind farms off the coast of China, the US or Africa in 15 or 20 years time or less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Green Rebel has quite a lot of scientists.

There could be a situation where a main port is being used for marshalling services and a nearby port is also involved in taking on some of that work.  There can be multi-port opportunities.  The facility at Belfast Port is fantastic.  If the committee members ever get the chance to visit it, I highly recommend it.  It is an example of what first-class facilities for construction and marshalling look like.  With the best will in the world, you cannot build 5,000 MW of offshore wind simultaneously in five different projects from that facility.  Either you put them in a queue, basically, and do them as quickly as possible to get through the work, or you find other port facilities or infrastructure.  With Shannon Foynes, there is enormous potential for the port to be a hub not just for the construction of offshore wind farms but as a place where we can bring power onshore and create green hydrogen, which is one of the real exciting export opportunities for Ireland.

We are now aiming for an 80% renewable figure.  It is important to put the issue in context and it is worth saying that Scotland is different.  That brings me to the following question.  With capital and construction capacity scarce for public investment in Ireland, the organisations represented today are urging the Government to do more and to put more of its money into accelerating offshore wind beyond what it is already anticipating.  I want to tease that out.  Are the organisations' higher ambitions conditional on export?  Is that really the context, rather than greening our existing grid?  Will it require additional interconnection and the development of the green hydrogen sector?  There are obviously different phases to the work, and different elements have higher priority at a time of constrained resources, a housing crisis and all of the other issues.  The challenge facing the Government is choosing which of these things are most urgent.  How do the organisations represented assess that urgency in the context of other issues, as well as the fact that it requires the development of a hydrogen sector that is still relatively underutilised?  There needs to be a hydrogen strategy here that gives us a context for that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have stated that there the water off the west coast is extraordinarily  deep, conditions are harsh, and will still be difficult to work in.  Should this be more of a European infrastructural play than simply an Irish play?  Should we be looking to the longer-term global context in which the Atlantic resource will be tapped into?  Does that alter the view of the witnesses on how this opportunity should be developed?<\/p> <p>  I am also interested to know what the successful elements of the Scottish strategy were, and what mistakes were made so that we can perhaps learn from them.  I know that the Scottish project is different.  Scotland has a bigger connection and a bigger demand source on its doorstep.  Those are my questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#E00900","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I might refer to my colleague, Ms O'Connell, to respond to the Deputy's question on the Scottish strategy.  I agree with the Deputy that the target that we have to deliver 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030 is extremely ambitious.  We definitely think it is deliverable but in order for that to happen, a lot of things need to fall into place in terms of our planning system, our grid system and our route to market.  We appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action a few months ago.  We stated that we have a 50:50 chance of achieving the 5 GW the target for offshore wind energy specifically.  We are not here to say that we need a higher target for offshore wind.  We are saying that we really need to double down and focus on delivering that 5 GW of offshore wind energy.  That said, we want the highlight the opportunity that that target presents for the domestic supply chain.  It is true that capital and resources are scarce but those projects will be built.  The question that we would like to highlight today is whether they will be built from Irish ports and by Irish companies.  That is why the establishment of a delivery task force on supply chain to try to produce an action plan is critical, so that as much of that potential and investment that we are going to see to deliver our 2030 targets remains within Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On whether the potential we are talking about is really for the export opportunity, we will need an enormous amount of electricity to service Ireland as we go towards 2050 and towards becoming a climate-neutral country.  We did some analysis with UCC's MaREI centre looking at a zero-carbon economy for Ireland.  It showed that electricity demand will triple between now and 2050, predominantly as we electrify heat and transport.  We are going to need around 25 GW of offshore wind energy purely for our own domestic purposes before we even contemplate the export potential opportunity that we have off our west coast, which we believe to be equivalent to around 70 GW to 80 GW of capacity.  The establishment of a hydrogen supply chain will be very important to that over time.  We are not talking about purely direct electrification for everything.  The electricity grid that we currently have is not capable of managing the level of energy that I have just spoken about.  We will need hydrogen in order to decarbonise heat and transport, but the source and the base of that will be offshore wind energy.  The more that we can establish our own supply chain, the better.<\/p> <p>  On the European side of things, currently, countries across Europe are trying to get off fossil fuels as quickly as possible, following the crisis in Ukraine.  We are seeing countries right across Europe increasing their targets for offshore wind energy every week.  Two years ago, the 2030 offshore wind target in Europe was 60 GW.  Just two weeks ago there was an announcement that Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands will be developing 65 GW by themselves between now and 2030.  Right across Europe, we are hearing that supply chain constraints are a big challenge.  All the countries will need to pool together their resources and supply chains if we are to have any chance of meeting Europe's target.

When the sector deal was signed, it was looking at offshore wind in the whole of the UK.  As it has developed, Scotland has started to focus on what Scotland can do itself, rather than with England and Wales.  Looking at the whole of the UK, one of the lessons learned is thinking about what the different parts of the country need.  Originally, there was the Offshore Wind Industry Council, which was for the whole of the UK.  Now, Scotland has its own Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council.  It is looking at what Scotland needs, rather than what the rest of the UK needs.  That is one of the lessons learned.<\/p><p>It has also been a focus in the UK.  The benefits of offshore wind are not concentrated within one area.  The wind farms are all around the coast.  We need therefore to look to understand where we can develop clusters for innovation for the development of the supply chain.  That is in around areas such as Cork, the west, Foynes and the east.  That cluster effect is important for having a national strategy, as well as for thinking about what we need in different parts of the country.  That is one key lesson that has been learned.  It is also safe to say that the UK and Scotland are still on the journey in offshore wind.  They have been successful to date, but they still have much work to do.  We are also facing some of the challenges they are facing.  There are lessons to learned by working together.  Some of those challenges, particularly for Scotland, relate to grid infrastructure.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised the point of export opportunity around interconnection.  That is also a challenge for Scotland.  We must understand that they are nearly at 100% renewables on their system.  They are already exporting their energy to England.  They are looking to see where they can export it abroad.  System integration is a challenge.  Resourcing is also a challenge.  That is a key challenge for Ireland.  It is a matter of resourcing within the industry as well as across the industry, for example with the likes of EirGrid, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the environmental organisations.  This comes back to our point that it is important that we come together to learn the lessons from other markets.  Those primarily come from the industries.  It is a matter of many international players coming to Ireland and people like myself coming back to Ireland.  We can share the lessons we have learned.  We can ask what is right for Ireland.  We can ask what we want the vision to be.

There are still many uncertainties in terms of policies related to grid infrastructure and planning systems.  These are being baked into driving up costs.  When it comes to costs specifically for offshore wind and for floating offshore wind energy, we do not yet have a good example in Europe for what the costs of developing floating offshore wind energy for commercial-scale projects will be.  Britain and France are both in the process of developing and running auctions specifically for floating wind energy.

Such a strategy is in the process of being developed, but we do not have it yet.  We understand the consultation for that will be published shortly.  As a country, we need to stimulate not just the supply of hydrogen, which is where the renewable energy comes in, but also the demand for hydrogen.

The more certainty that we can provide to the development community for renewable electricity through having a planning system, a grid system and a supply chain that works, the cheaper we can produce renewable power and the cheaper we can transition to hydrogen.

I have met Mr. Cunniffe and Mr. Moran at exhibitions and so on and we have engaged.  I have a specific concern, as I have highlighted to them, about the potential for wind energy off the south-east coast, not least in the Copper Coast area, and the potential for damage to amenities.  It is important that this committee has an ongoing engagement with the wider wind energy sector, but I would support our guests' call for at least a sector deal and for a representative from the offshore industry to sit on the co-ordination group.  Perhaps that is something the committee can speak about in private session.<\/p> <p>  As I have said to our guests previously, I have concerns about a lack of State ownership in the wind energy sector as it develops, primarily because we do not have expertise and I can see that something similar to what happened with the oil industry is going to happen.  Ultimately, we will sell the licences, foreign players will come in and provide everything and we will ask what we really got out of it.   We might not even get a good rate of electricity charged to the State.<\/p> <p>  I am also worried about how the coastal communities will be looked after.  One issue I have previously raised relates to how a community dividend, which in general in the wind sector is looked at for about 15 years over the lifetime of a farm, should be paid every year.  If a turbine turns at sea or on land, a community needs to be resourced from that.  I am worried not only about amenities in tourism but also about the fishing industry.  Ms O&rsquo;Connell might speak about Scotland in a moment.  Some of the largest spawning grounds in Europe are to be found off the south coast of Ireland, so she might comment on the effects of talking about putting wind infrastructure out there.<\/p> <p>  Is any potential tie-up being signalled for people who are coming in to invest in wind infrastructure whereby they would also tie in hydrogen development?  Rather than say we are going to create wind farms and then talk about creating hydrogen plants, are any conglomerates interested in coming with that package and saying that as part of their wind farm licence, they would be prepared to invest in hydrogen development onshore?  In the south east, we have one of the most significant gateways to composite developments in the form of turbine manufacture.  Mr. Cunniffe referred to a course starting in Kerry, but we need very significant academic linkage and his organisation mentioned it was hoping to engage with higher education.<\/p> <p>  We are at an early stage, but I would like to see a sectoral deal done, with our guests getting representation and with us, as a committee, engaging with them twice a year.  It would be good to get committee members out - visits to Belfast, Scotland or wherever were mentioned - to understand where this wind generation deal is going.  There is no doubt there is opportunity in this for Ireland, but I very much fear it is going to pass us by.  I fear that foreign players will dominate the space and that we may not see much out of it other than, as I said, a not very competitive tariff on wind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#G00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I might hand over to Ms O'Connell to take the fishing question relating to Scotland and to my colleague, Mr. Moran, to comment on coastal communities.  In regard to the State ownership question, there are many active State-owned companies in the energy sector in Ireland right now.  Everyone will be familiar with the ESB, one of the largest owners of onshore wind energy in Ireland.  Through a partnership between the ESB and Coillte, Future Energy Ireland has been established as a State company developing onshore wind energy and Bord na M&oacute;na is very much established as an onshore wind energy and solar developer as well.  There is a great deal of State involvement in that.  Moreover, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is one of the main investors in Ms O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s Inis Offshore Wind.  We will see investment from the State in that.<\/p> <p>  Any offshore wind farm that is developed around Ireland will also pay a seabed lease, so revenue for the State will be generated from every offshore wind farm that is developed.  We are also seeing considerable levels of investment in, as I mentioned, many ports throughout the country, which are putting up their hands and saying they want to invest here and to keep as much money in Ireland as they can.  We have seen those announcements in Arklow and Wicklow from maintenance and operations bases being set up.<\/p> <p>  My one concern, as has been suggested by a number of groups previously, is that if we were to take a step back and to establish a State body to develop offshore wind energy, it would take a very long time to resource that and to establish both it and a regulator.  We would not develop a single offshore wind turbine for the next ten to 15 years if we were to do that.  Many of the projects around our coasts have been in development for years or, in some cases, decades, and those projects need to proceed and we need to be able to establish that.  There is a significant role for the State in resourcing Departments.  We need a functional State Department, through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to be able to deliver the full potential for this industry in order that we can get a return for the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>In regard to fishing, I was working primarily in England but had some interaction with Scotland as well.

Nevertheless, it is important that when we come back to Ireland, we understand the concerns of the fishing industry here and how we can solve those problems.  Some lessons will be learned, but Ireland is unique and the fishing industry is really important to the country.   For us at Inis Offshore Wind, it is the number one stakeholder we have.  Very early on, we engaged with it to understand its concerns and how we could mitigate its concerns whether through the wind farm design or by finding ways to coexist.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Moran to discuss the initiative going on within Wind Energy Ireland, specifically as it relates to the fishing industry and the groups that have been formed.  I was very happy to hear the Deputy welcome the sector deal.

It relates to community benefit and to ensuring that will be spread over the lifetime of the project.  It is something we would like to see as well and we would expect to see it from our members, but the community benefit fund as a requirement of the contract an offshore wind farm will get is related to the duration of the contract.  We will clearly say to our members that just because the contract is running out, that does not mean they get to close shop and go away.  They will still need to support those local communities but the contract will run out after 15 or 16 years.<\/p> <p>  As for our engagement with the fishing community, we both do that at a project level, whereby officers talk to fishermen on specific piers and around harbours.  We are also increasingly doing it on a national level with the existing fishing organisations.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently appointed a chairperson for what is called the seafood offshore renewable energy working group, which will bring together about 11 or 12 fishing organisations and us, representing the offshore wind sector, but also - this is important - the Departments and State agencies that are relevant to this, such as Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These people have been put together to sit around the table and ensure that when we develop these wind farms, we will be conscious of the impact they may have on marine biodiversity and the environment and, in particular, on the coastal and fishing communities that depend on those waters for their livelihoods and to pay rent and send their kids to college.<\/p><p>Not only should these wind farms not be an impediment to them, there is an opportunity here.  I might bring Mr. Ivers in to talk about this in a moment.  There is enormous opportunity here for people with marine skills and there are very few people in Ireland with more marine skills than fishermen.  They would be able to work and be part of the development of offshore renewable energy.  It would also be useful to hear from Mr. Ivers about getting Irish companies into the supply chain.  We want Irish companies, whether semi-State bodies or private sector companies, to get into the Irish supply chain.

We are well aware that the bounty achieved in Cork from the Kinsale gas field was the contract for catering.  That needs to be reversed.  We cannot make the same mistakes again.  Ireland has a poor history in the context of benefiting from our own natural resources.  A sectoral deal is not an off-the-shelf solution.  It can only be achieved with collaboration between the Government, industry and officials.  The by-product of that type of collaboration is a sectoral deal that is bespoke to Ireland and that we can benefit from.  That should encourage the development of an indigenous supply chain, as well as foreign direct investment into Ireland.  We cannot do it all ourselves but we can encourage investment and make provisions so those who want to do business in Ireland have to invest in Ireland and not just create a postcode.  Deputy Bruton spoke about dipping into Ireland's coffers.  In Scotland, the industry stimulus that was provided, from the developer's pocket, as a result of that collaboration has been critically important.<\/p> <p>  Collaboration between entities will also help the Government identify some of the surmountable challenges the industry is facing right now.  One example in Green Rebel's world is this issue around licensing and foreshore licences.  Right now we have a buoy, a floating LiDAR innovation, which is best in class globally and was developed in Ireland specifically to target floating offshore wind.  We are having to send it to Rotterdam, and will continue to do so over the next two years, investing north of &euro;3 million, in order to get its certification because we cannot get licensing here.  We are not talking about the licensing of an offshore wind farm.  This is a tiny piece but these are surmountable challenges that can only be brought to this type of forum.

They may have learned lessons in other countries that can help deliver it here.<\/p> <p>  Earlier, Ms O'Connell mentioned the Offshore Wind Industry Council, which has been established in the UK.  It has considerable industry, Government and State buy-in to develop something similar to this.  The Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council has something similar too.  There was a Norwegian delegation in Wexford last week.  They also mentioned that there is industry involvement in their establishment.  Their partnership is not quite a sector deal, but people are coming together to deliver this.  We are asking for the best practices that have been put in place in other jurisdictions to establish global leaders in offshore wind industry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>-----walls, compared to the various auctions that are run.

We would have to figure out exactly how it would work in Ireland.  It could probably be an offshoot of the offshore wind industry taskforce.  The industry and the Government would be involved.  It would then be a matter of figuring out what the focus areas should be.  Today, we are very focused on the supply chain.  When you look at the sector deals in the UK, Poland and elsewhere, supply chain is a key focus.  Other elements that are focused on include the points around system integration and resourcing.<\/p> <p>  One issue I have not mentioned today, which is extremely important, is the environment.  There is now a big focus on having a net-positive effect on the environment from offshore wind.  We can only get that by working together.  As it currently stands, offshore wind farms will do their own environmental assessments on a project-by-project basis.  The environment is much broader than that.  There is much work now ongoing in talking about some sort of strategic compensation and looking across the board.  We would have to work together to figure out how the implementation would work.  The Government needs to do its business, but there needs to be collaboration.  We must figure out where it makes sense to do it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Vanessa O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Would anyone  like to deal with the regional question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#J00600","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will deal with that question.  At the moment, a number of our members in those areas are engaging with those regional economic strategies.  They are engaging particularly with councils, for example, on their plans for developing.  They are looking at how wind energy can be part of that.  We are also finding a real enthusiasm from the regional economic groups, regional assemblies and county councils who want to be involved in it.  We are not encountering resistance there.  It is an open door.  They see the potential that will be in their geographic locations.<\/p> <p>  That is driven more by groups of members in various areas, rather than by Wind Energy Ireland.  To be honest, from our perspective, that is a capacity issue.  We would love to be more involved in that, but we are focused on the national view.  Our members are focused very much on areas such as Shannon, Cork and Wexford, where companies are coming together to work with existing regional local apparatuses.  This is to see if, for example, there is to be port in Rosslare, what benefits will come out of that for all of the enterprise opportunities in Wexford and in the south east.  Members are actively involved in doing that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The merit of those regional enterprise strategies is that they bring in the players.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#J00800","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655247600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022061500002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1655247600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>They bring the ports, Enterprise Ireland, the IDAs, the councils and the education interests to the table.

I have been with delegations from the Netherlands, Belgium and Great Britain.  We have had contact from as far away as Brazil to try to bring their supply chain here.  They see the opportunity that Ireland can provide in this decade, as well as the growth that it can provide.  We would like to ensure that while we are delivering this industry we have that domestic supply chain in place to capture as much of that as possible.  Therefore, in years to come, we will be able to send delegations to other countries.  Mr. Ivers already spoke about some of the great work that Enterprise Ireland is doing in that regard.
