The Strategy sets out a high-level framework to support our ambition for Ireland to be a digital leader, at the heart of European and global digital developments.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s digital ambition is aligned with EU priorities, under the EU&rsquo;s Digital Decade, and our national priorities, as reflected in the 2021 Economic Recovery Plan and Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), which had digitalisation and decarbonisation at its core with investments to a total value of &euro;291 million.<\/p>  <p>  The National Digital Strategy draws together the substantial amount of digital work progressing across Government, to ensure a renewed coherent and joined up approach to Ireland&rsquo;s digital offering. As such, it does not have a specific amount of funding allocated for its implementation. However, it does include different initiatives that have funding allocated through either the NRRP or Budget 2022. Within my Department's remit, &euro;85 million is allocated through to 2026 for the Digital Transition Fund which will drive the adoption of digital technologies across enterprise. There are other commitments where the funding required will be agreed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy will be overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, supported by the Digital Issues Senior Officials Group. They will review progress annually.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To inform its development, a Stakeholder Roundtable discussion was held on 9th November 2021. The National Digital Strategy also relied on the public consultation process originally carried out in 2018\/2019. This consultation invited members of the public and interested stakeholders to make submissions that would inform the scope and delivery of the new strategy and the completed document takes into account the views expressed by stakeholders during that consultation process.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government will shortly establish the new Enterprise Digital Advisory Forum, which will include expert stakeholders to support the implementation of the National Digital Strategy as well as advising on the digital transformation of enterprise.

The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the\u00a0Scheme\u00a0at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. <\/p><p>I am\u00a0also aware that\u00a0a report was published\u00a0by the CCMA on\u00a0the provision of\u00a0guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure.\u00a0The document is available for viewing online at\u00a0<i>www.lgma.ie\/en\/publications\/general-publications\/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf<\/i>.<\/p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric.

My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 which represents a doubling of staff numbers.<\/p>  <p>  It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times for first time applications in 2022. The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service:<\/p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.<\/p>  <p>  - A new document management process is being put in place in the coming days that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in three weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We are confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:<\/p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p>  <p>  First time passport applications do take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process. In cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct. Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required adding to the processing time.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently over 160,000 passport applications in the system. While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. There is a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day. Passport Service figures show that 57% of applications are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service.

Rent increases in student accommodation are capped under the Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ). Recent legislation restricts the amount that students can be required to pay up front for their accommodation, ending the practice whereby students were required to pay a lump sum up front each term. For tenancies created on or after 9 August 2021, the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 restricts the total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent (i.e. any deposit cannot exceed 1 month&rsquo;s rent and any advance rent payment cannot exceed 1 month&rsquo;s rent). Previously, families were required to pay a lump sum each term (often in the range of &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,500). The Act also limits termination notice periods in respect of student-specific accommodation, so that no more than 28 days&rsquo; notice is required to be given by students. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to work closely with Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on these issues.

Support and assistance for those running CCTV schemes is available by contacting: fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie<\/p>  <p>  Community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:<\/p>  <p>  - be approved by the local\u00a0Joint Policing Committee,<\/p>  <p>  - have the prior support\u00a0of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller,\u00a0and<\/p>  <p>  - have the authorisation\u00a0of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.\u00a0\u00a0These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, the Data Protection Commission have carried out an in-depth, independent review of community CCTV schemes. My Department is incorporating amendments into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings)\u00a0Bill\u00a0to address these findings.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill 2021 was approved by the Government and published on the 29th\u00a0April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. The General Scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.\u00a0 The Committee&rsquo;s report was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by my officials. It is my intention to publish the Bill by the end of March 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will provide statutory underpinning for Garda overt recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals in this new legislation and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. It is expected the Bill will be enacted in 2022.\u00a0 The legislation, once enacted, will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that\u00a0&euro;1m funding has been allocated in the Garda vote for the CCTV Scheme for 2022.<\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from the Department's website\u00a0and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seekers","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH01500"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[12031\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the average waiting time for persons in emergency accommodation centres for asylum seekers to be issued with an appointment or invitation to the International Protection Office; the number of asylum seekers that are in emergency accommodation and Balseskin, Dublin who have not yet formally applied for protection nor received their temporary residency card; the steps that will be taken to ensure swift access to all material supports in line with Ireland&rsquo;s international human rights obligations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>The overall objective of the Department is to have recommendations made on international protection applications as soon as possible.

Nonetheless, the Department of Health has continued to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop a robust implementation option.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the Pathfinder project is a priority for me and I will continue to keep this matter under close review in the context of progressing Sharing the Vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[11841\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that a person (details supplied) who was in possession of a full medical card which expired during Covid was only reissued with a general practitioner visit card despite the fact that their medical needs did not change over the past year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[11846\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical cards that have expired during the Covid-19 restrictions; the number that have been reissued during the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[11847\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons who were in possession of full medical cards during Covid-19 restrictions whose cards had expired during the restrictions were reissued with a general practitioner visit card only; the rationale for this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[11856\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200079#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the criteria for health and social care professionals registration for physiotherapists who achieve their qualification within the European Union but outside Ireland; the options that are available for such qualified persons in the event that CORU insist upon further Irish hospital placements being carried out before registration is approved specifically when such placements are not available within the Irish hospital system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":391,"content":"<p>CORU is Ireland's multi-profession health and social care regulator.

This addresses the first relevant commitment in the\u00a0Housing for All\u00a0Strategy (action 19.7). This removed a disincentive against the sale of properties that might otherwise remain vacant.<\/p>  <p>  As well as introducing the change above, the Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties \"in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people\". It is important to note that complex policy questions remain in meeting these criteria and there are high risks associated with unintended consequences.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents.

There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any future changes are appropriate to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and

COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place this month on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic. The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff \/ equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>   The Department of Health appreciates the levels of interest this announcement has generated. We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars (including payment dates), terms and conditions that apply. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.<\/p>  <p>  Though noting the above work is still ongoing, it is envisaged that the process for paying eligible public sector healthcare workers will commence this month. For eligible healthcare workers in private sector nursing homes and hospices, noting the additional complexities involved, it is envisaged the process will commence in the second quarter of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200081#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200081#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[11895\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200081#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress that has been made with the tender for an audiology testing facility for Tuam primary care centre; when the testing facility will be operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200081#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Reviews","counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200081#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":464,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[11896\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200081#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a full breakdown of the areas being covered in the research being carried out by a person (details supplied) as part of the three year review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":465,"content":"<p>The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was signed into law on 20 December 2018 and commenced on 1 January 2019.

This decision is facilitated by the high level of vaccine-induced and naturally acquired population immunity in Ireland which is mitigating against the worst impacts of infection.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 or other viral respiratory tract infection should immediately self-isolate and continue to do so until 48 hours after symptoms have substantially or fully resolved.<\/p>  <p>  Testing for public health purposes is now advised for those most vulnerable to the effects of the disease.

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical\/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects.  <\/p>  <p>  Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT), notably transdermal patches. The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT products, Estradot, has increased by between 77% and 117% for, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of Estradot in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The suppliers have confirmed that they have increased supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel\/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. In the interim, the companies have indicated that they are working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.  <\/p>  <p>  The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within our regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that we are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. We are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200082#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200082#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[12010\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200082#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients per CHO on neurology waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

This is due to the need for my officials to verify that the service at each BCP is as users would expect and that the work has been completed to the requisite high standard. Sites do not become billable until this verification process has been completed. The map is updated periodically to include recently commissioned sites. <\/p><p>With regard to component shortages, the layer 3 8-port switches used at many BCPs have proven difficult to source due to the global semi-conductor shortage. Standard switches are the point at which the initial connectivity comes into the premises from the wireless link (dish) outside the premises and is then redirected to the WiFi access points for the public to use. Layer 3 switches allow for wired and networked equipment such as desktop PCs, printers, smart screens, remote access door controls and onsite managed firewalls, as well as the standard WiFi solution. As such, they are essential to the future-proofing of BCPs, adding another level of amenity beyond the original scope of the project. <\/p><p>Due to the same issues impacting on delivery of the switches, the enterprise-grade WiFi access points used at BCPs have also been difficult to source.<\/p><p>We have been informed that the remaining WiFi access points and switches will be delivered by the end of this month and that Vodafone, the retail service provider contracted by my department to support the BCP network, will work to deploy these as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200083#WRM03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[11927\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030200083#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the status of the additional development activities connected to broadband connection points namely the pilot projects trialling new activities and services; the details of pilot projects; the locations of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>Public Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) provide supports for the whole community, remote workers, students, local community groups and schools.
