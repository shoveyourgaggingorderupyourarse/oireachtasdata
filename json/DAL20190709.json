I pay tribute to people like John Allen, a victim of child sexual abuse who has been denied any redress from the State to date.  I also pay tribute to John Boland, Thomas Hogan, Christopher Rainbow and their colleagues from Limerick, who worked with Deputy O'Dea.  For more than four years they have fought the Government's obstinate position of the invocation of a prior complaint mechanism to deny them any access to the redress scheme.<\/p><p>The decision of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill also vindicates the vital and professional work of Dr. Conor O'Mahony and the Child Law Clinic in University College Cork who has advocated on behalf of the victims for so long and exposed the illogicality and cruelty of the Government's position in the past four years.  Much of the argument put forward by Dr. O'Mahony has essentially been upheld by the judge in his assessment.  The prior complaint was, in my opinion, a device to ensure no one would receive compensation under the scheme and so it proved.  As the judge said, having any such mechanism would have involved, as a starting point, the making of a complaint by or on behalf of an abused child.  It was obvious from day one that this was illogical.  The judge has said that for the State to insist on such a precondition to eligibility involved an \"inherent inversion of logic and a fundamental unfairness to applicants.\" <\/p> <p> The Government was warned about all of this.  I raised the matter with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, during Leaders' Questions and the Taoiseach.  I met the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and his officials, who stonewalled on every occasion.  We tabled a Private Members' motion last year which was passed by the House.  As Dr. O'Mahony said, the Government set up a compensation scheme, but it did not want to pay any compensation.  It has dragged on for four years and the people involved have suffered enormous trauma and abuse in their lives.  I have met them.  It has been appalling.  The deliberate distortion of the O'Keeffe judgment has exacerbated that hurt and abuse for the victims who have been denied access to the redress scheme.  It was morally wrong of the Government and its predecessor to pursue this line, particularly when it was pointed out so cogently to them by Dr. O'Mahony, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and the Ombudsman for Children.  Why was the Government so deaf to the obvious and the logical?  Why was the O'Keeffe judgment so blatantly distorted?  Why did the Government go along with it, compounding the hurt already endured by the victims?  Will it apologise to them for its actions?  Does it accept in full the independent assessor's conclusions?  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the D&aacute;il what the Government intends to do in respect of pending and discontinued cases and whether they will be accommodated as they should be under the redress scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562677500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I believe sexual abuse is the most heinous of all crimes, especially when the victims are children.  It stays with them forever; trust is betrayed; lives are destroyed forever and families broken.  On behalf of the State, I apologise to the people who were sexually abused when they were children in day schools before 1992 and for the State's delay thereafter in acknowledging that it had a responsibility to protect them.  As Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill has reported, had a system to report abuse &quot;been in place in the years before 1992 when all of the historic child sexual abuse occurred in national schools ... the prevailing culture of impunity which permitted these crimes to occur, could not have existed or survived.&quot;  I thank Mr. Justice O'Neill for the two years of work he has done since his appointment by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.<\/p><p>Procedures should have been in place before 1992 to record and act on allegations of sexual abuse by teachers and staff.  They were not and Governments prior to 1992 failed in their responsibility to do so.  Successive Governments since, including this one, have not put right this historical wrong and so have perpetuated it.  We will seek to right that wrong now.  The intentions may have been honourable, to provide for abuse survivors, while protecting taxpayers who, ultimately, has to pay the bill for things for which they were not responsible.  It was wrong to make the terms of the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme so restrictive.  The State will now make payments without undue delay to the 13 people whose appeals have been successful.  It is clear that there are other cases in which survivors did not appeal or did not apply in the first place and they will have to be re-examined.<\/p><p>It may involve reopening the scheme.  I have asked the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, to prepare options for the Government in consultation with the Attorney General.  I join the Minister in calling on patron bodies to make available any information and documents they have.  The same applies to the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p> I recognise the campaigning and advocacy role of Louise O'Keeffe, on her own behalf and that of others.  Even today, many victims of sexual abuse do not report it, but the fact that people such as Louise do gives them hope, courage and some comfort.  Without meaningful action, apologies on their own do not count for very much.  The best apology we can make to Louise O'Keeffe and all other survivors is to say further action will be taken.  The State failed them at the time and failed them again when it did not own up to its responsibility.  We will not fail them a third time.  The Minister will make a further statement on the matter tomorrow afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562677800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Taoiseach's statement and acceptance that what the Government did was wrong.

To me, it will have to involve a reopening of the scheme because it was founded on the wrong premise.  In an assessment of the judgment Dr. Conor O'Mahony stated that to limit the implications to the 13 cases was a wilful distortion of the assessor's decision.  He went on to state that if the condition of prior compliant was inherently incompatible with the O'Keeffe judgment, as a matter of human rights law, it must be dropped for all applicants.  Cases are pending, while others have been discontinued because of the extraordinary pressure put on many of the litigants and victims.  It is accepted that many victims of child sexual abuse go through extraordinary trauma throughout their lives.  When the power of the State is devoted to continuously denying them justice, that trauma is exacerbated beyond belief.  The Taoiseach stated the Government would not fail the victims again.

There are also people who might not have applied in the first place because they believed they had no possibility of receiving a payment.  We need to look at the matter in the round.

As the Taoiseach knows, the officer in command of the Naval Service, Commodore Michael Malone, wrote in a Defence Forces newsletter on 27 June that 540 personnel had left the service in the past five years and that because of an inadequate number of personnel, he had taken the decision to place two ships in an operational reserve capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In response to that information making its way into the public domain last weekend, the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, dismissed it, as he has consistently dismissed concerns about the recruitment and retention crisis in the Defence Forces when these matters have been raised.  On Saturday evening he claimed the two ships were being docked because of what he called \"planned maintenance\" and crews were being redeployed to other vessels.  He directly contradicted the concerns of Commodore Malone.  The Taoiseach yesterday accepted that the Naval Service faces significant staffing challenges and said it was \"cutting its cloth to measure\".  He agreed with Commodore Malone and contradicted the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach think it appropriate for the Minister of State to withdraw his remarks given that he was wrong and his assertion was inaccurate?  I believe that should happen today.  The docking of two naval vessels will have consequences and a number of military sources in the press this morning spelt out precisely what will be those challenges.  A source indicated that because of Ireland's massive sea area, having nine vessels is like having two Garda cars patrolling the island of Ireland, so with the vessels docked, it is like having one and a half such patrol cars.  Another source said that this is like having a \"neon sign for drug smugglers\" because the deterrent factor is gone, with the end result being more drugs on the streets in Dublin, Portarlington, Ballina and so on.<\/p>  <p>  That is the potential outworking of this issue.  Fewer naval patrols in Irish waters because two vessels are docked means there will be fewer drug seizures and less of a deterrent.  That cannot continue, so it is time for serious action to tackle what is a serious recruitment and retention crisis facing the Naval Service and the Defence Forces more generally.  It is clear the recent recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission are wholly inadequate.  The Naval Service is operating at 88% of capacity and personnel numbers across the board have dropped below 8,500, despite a commitment to maintain numbers at 9,500.  Morale is on the floor; 1,000 people left last year and 92 left in the past month alone.  This is a very real crisis so what will the Taoiseach as Minister for Defence do about all of this?  When will he ask the Minister of State to withdraw his inaccurate comments from the public record?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900006#D00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1562678100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Government, including the Minister of State, has acknowledged for quite some time that the Naval Service is short-staffed.  It has a complement of 1,094 personnel but it currently has just 934 personnel.  The numbers often do not tell the full story as it is particularly short-staffed when it comes to certain specialists and technical staff.  There has been no denial at all from the Government in that respect and instead we have taken action.  Pay is being restored through the public sector pay agreement and pay for all staff in the public service earning &euro;70,000 or less will be fully restored by the end of next year.  In addition, we signed off on a &euro;10 million package for the Defence Forces last week that will provide additional allowances and other improvements.  The process will not stop there, as there will be a review of technician pay, which is particularly relevant because people with particular technical skills, including engineers, artificers and others are especially sought after in the private sector now and they can command very good salaries.  We need to review that pay as well.  Those are the kinds of actions very much under way by the Government.<\/p><p>I am happy to clear up any confusion about the fleet.  The Naval Service currently has nine vessels.  There used to be eight but, because we have invested in the fleet and have a more modern fleet than ever before, there are five new vessels while only four have been decommissioned.  We have more vessels than ever before but we have fewer sailors and that has obviously created a problem.<br\/><br\/>Of the nine vessels, <i>L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n <\/i>is going through a mid-life refit and will not be available for service until the end of the year.  <i>L&Eacute; Eithne <\/i>and <i>L&Eacute; Orla <\/i>are going through planned maintenance, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, said and that was confirmed by the press office of the Defence Forces last night.  What is different is that their crews are now being redeployed to the other vessels to ensure they are fully crewed and staffed.  That is important from a retention point of view because we want to retain our able seamen and Naval Service staff, rather than having them spread too thinly and short-staffed on a large number of ships.  It is better to have a small number of ships fully staffed and I support the decision of the flag officer in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Those vessels will be out of service until the end of September and mid-October but, with current staffing levels, it is unlikely they can be brought back into service.  That means that three ships will be held in operational reserve or in maintenance, with the remaining six vessels fully operational.  It means some operations will be restricted.  For example, the Naval Service will not be able to return to the Mediterranean because we must instead focus on our own seas, fishery protection and drug interdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900006#D00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562678400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Why then did the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, contradict Commodore Michael Malone?

There is also an issue about staffing levels and the Naval Service is understaffed and, for that reason, there is going to be a change of practice.  Where boats are put into maintenance or into reserve, the crews will then be redeployed to vessels that are in service.  It is never the case that all nine vessels are at sea.  It is often the case that vessels are in maintenance or in refit or in dock.  Rather than having a situation which has been the case for the past couple of months where crews have been thinly spread across a larger number of vessels - and I have been on these vessels - there will be a smaller number of vessels which are now fully staffed.  That also makes sense from a retention point of view because, where staff are stretched across a large number of vessels, it becomes much harder for them to do their jobs.

These hospitals are being built with State funding at a high cost.  A key element of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms of the health service is the removal of private practice from the public health system.  It seems that the provision of private facilities in these two new public hospitals flies in the face of this key element of Sl&aacute;intecare, namely, the separation of private medicine from the public system.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan announced late last year, a report was commissioned on the issue of separation of public and private care.  The report was to be produced by a group headed by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir.  I understand that such a report has been with the Minister for Health and his officials for some weeks now.  Will the Minister make the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, and any recommendations it contains, public and available for discussion in the D&aacute;il where the Sl&aacute;intecare proposals received widespread cross-party support?  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that no private medical facilities will be planned or provided at the new maternity and children's hospitals?  At the very least, will he give a commitment that this House will have an opportunity to debate the issues in the report before any such facilities are provided?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900010#H03500","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1562679900,"counter":119,"content":"<p>As I understand it, it is not the case that there will be separate entrances.

Even across the water, for example, the National Health Service, NHS, in Britain also has private clinics.  The Great Ormond Street Hospital, the centrepiece NHS hospital, has a private clinic.

The report refers to the implementation of the recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare to disentangle public and private medicine in our hospitals.  The term \"disentangle\" is a very good one.  This is not something that can be done quickly or overnight.  It involves a fundamental change to the consultants' contracts, for a start.  That will have to be negotiated and will take time.   A very long period may be involved where we phase out all contracts and replace them with new ones and that will also take some time to achieve.  It will also be necessary to find &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million to compensate our public hospitals for the loss of private income.  We should never forget that.  Private patients do not just pay private income to consultants; they also pay private income to public hospitals.

The Government is going to allow a separate department with a waiting room, a reception area and access to facilities within the hospitals, including a public laboratory and diagnostic services.

When the review group was set up last October, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on 3 October that the current mixed model was not the norm and was an outlier.  He said: \"Let me be clear, because sometimes I hear myself described by my opponents wrongly in this regard, I am in favour of the removal of private practice from public hospitals.\"  Yet, at this very minute, Crumlin Children's Hospital is stating it is going to give consultants access to private rooms, private reception areas and access to public laboratories and diagnostics.

It takes into account a number of factors, such as the need to ensure that people who are at work get a decent wage but also the need to ensure we do not end up doing anything counterproductive by causing people to lose their jobs, particularly in Border areas, or to lose their hours, thereby ending up worse off if we make it too high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900019#R00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1562684400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>There is great concern and anxiety in Clonmel and wider County Tipperary at the fact that Glenville Crisis House, a mental health crisis house in Clonmel, is still waiting to be signed off by the HSE.

The question is what has been done to ensure that the gaps that were evident in March are fully addressed in time for the new deadline.  Why has no new survey been published on levels of preparedness in Irish businesses?  These surveys were supposed to be regular but, for some unexplained reason, stopped last year.<\/p>  <p>  If preparations for a no-deal Brexit are serious, they have to include a target and the baseline assumption for the number of businesses that are prepared for handling a no-deal situation on 31 October.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Will the Taoiseach give the figures to the House?  <\/p> <p> In an intervention during the local elections the Commissioner, Phil Hogan, announced funding for Brexit-related payments to farmers.  I note that the Government has today recommended his reappointment.  It was the first time a Commissioner had chosen to intervene on a significant issue during an election campaign here.  In many respects, it was quite irregular.  What was not announced at the time was the conditions attached to the scheme.  Will the Taoiseach outline the final details of the scheme announced seven weeks ago?  Will he tell the House how many times the Brexit committee has met in 2019?  I noted his comments last week about Cabinet sub-committee meetings and his preference for general meetings.  That is an important indicator of how seriously the Government has taken this matter since March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900021#T04100","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562686200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I understand a briefing of opposition parties is taking place on the most recent contingency plan for Brexit.  There is a feeling of Groundhog Day.  At first glance it does not appear that contingency planning has moved forward to a significant degree, still less that it has taken leap forward that is necessary as we face the real possibility of a disorderly Brexit.  Information on the extent of contingency funds which must be made available for the initial impact of Brexit's economic shock has not yet been forthcoming from the Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a fund, initially worth &euro;2 billion, to make provision for the shock effect.  Will the Taoiseach enlighten us on whether it is part of the package on which we are being briefed today?  I put it to him that he could and should put a stop to the Mercosur trade deal as a means of protecting the rural economy, farm families and the consumer in a Brexit scenario.  It is extraordinary that the Government has reappointed Phil Hogan as Commissioner with Brexit looming.  He is the man who has described the deal as \"fair and balanced.\"  It is anything but; it may prove catastrophic for many people's livelihoods and that is without considering its effects on the Amazon and the damage caused to the planet.  Part of the preparations for Brexit must be the provision of adequate contingency funds for the initial shock.  The second part is to see off the Mercosur trade agreement.  Should a crash-out Brexit happen, the absolute priority must be ensuring there will be no economic border on the island and that we will not step backwards.  The only way we can do this is by having a conversation on constitutional change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900022#U00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1562686200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>This morning the chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association stated the obvious, that very few companies were 100% ready for an increasingly likely no-deal scenario.

The Labour Party has called for Rosslare Port to be re-ranked as a tier 1 port in the context of Brexit, yet it has emerged that the site where checks are to be carried out after Brexit was only purchased in March, only weeks before the United Kingdom was originally due to leave the European Union.  We do not know what will happen in Dublin if almost all freight in Ireland passes through Dublin Port.  Will lorries be parked on the hard shoulder of the M50, northbound and southbound?  That would be deeply worrying, particularly since the M50 is effectively clogged up on any given day at peak time.  What leadership is the Government prepared to give?

We have to say two things in response.  The all-Ireland economy should not be scarified to protect the Single Market.  We must tell the European Union that we want a special dispensation because of the damage it would do.  It also raises the very serious prospect, as even Simon Hoare, MP, Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster said, that a Border poll could result from this.  If even Tories and unionists are discussing the possibility of a Border poll, we should also talk about it as a basic democratic demand in the event that there is a hard Brexit to give the people of the North the opportunity to say \"No\" to the madness of Boris Johnson and the Tory wreckers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900022#U00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1562686200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The Brexit Cabinet sub-committee has not met in 2019.

The European Union is a union of treaties and laws and there are no special dispensations.  It is in our interests to defend the Single Market and the customs union.

It was ready for March and it certainly will be ready for 31 October.  The Port of Cork does not arise as an issue.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no vessels going from Cork to Britain.  They go from Rosslare and Dublin.  There are vessels going from Cork to Spain and from Waterford to the Netherlands.

It is important to say that while 40,000 companies have a number, another 40,000 do not.  It appears those that do not are those that do not do regular trade with the UK.  They may have ordered only one or two boxes of things from the UK in 2018.

Some people may assume there will be an extension if there is no deal but I do not think businesses can make that assumption and I would encourage any business that has not engaged to do so.

There is also a &euro;300 million future growth loan scheme for SMEs, including farmers, to back strategic long-term investment after Brexit.

These protections apply to workers in all sectors of the economy, both public and private.  They protect whistleblowers from being penalised by their employer for reporting wrongdoing in the workplace or suffering any detriment for doing so. <\/p>  <p>  The Act requires every public body to establish and maintain procedures for dealing with protected disclosures and to provide written information relating to these procedures to their employees.  In line with the Act, my Department has a policy on protected disclosures, which sets out the procedure by which an employee can make a disclosure, what will happen when a disclosure is made and what my Department will do to protect a discloser.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to fostering an appropriate environment for dealing with concerns and assisting staff in \"speaking up\" regarding potential wrongdoing in the workplace and to providing the necessary assistance for staff who raise genuine concerns.  To date, no disclosures have been received from employees or former employees of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is one of many reforms implemented by the Government in recent years and is putting Ireland ahead of many other countries in changing how politics works and how whistleblowers are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900024#W00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1562687400,"counter":449,"content":"<p>The high-profile whistleblower, the former Sergeant Maurice McCabe, exposed many wrongdoings.

He informed me that 52 protected disclosures had been received.

In addition, the Irish Prison Service, the Legal Aid Board, the National Disability Authority, the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, all have their own protected disclosures policies in place and report separately on disclosures received.  That is a significant number overall and there is a need for resources to be provided.  Has the Government undertaken a review of how the Act is working, how effective it is and the level of resources required to deal with the numbers of disclosures?

We cannot allow a perception to the contrary to develop among the public, especially among potential whistleblowers.

I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to correspond with the Deputy to give her an update and some answers to her particular questions.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked if there has been a review of the Act.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  published a statutory review of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 in July 2018.  That followed on from a public consultation.  This solicited 25 submissions from a variety of public bodies, interest groups and members of the public.  The review considered international developments, including comparative analysis, with legislation in other countries.  It also detailed some early results of the implementation of the Act across 212 public sector bodies.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 370 protected disclosures were received by the end of 2016.  The review shows the Act is viewed as setting a positive example internationally and has had a broadly positive outcome.  It highlights some implementation issues, which are being considered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  These include: providing absolute confidentiality to disclosers while balancing fair procedures for others concerned, including those against whom allegations have been made; the interaction of the Act with the GDPR legislation and other employment policies; and disclosures made through multiple channels and anonymous disclosures.<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of the review, the Government decided to set up an interdepartmental committee to capture views regarding the operation of the Protected Disclosures Act.  The committee was composed of officials with responsibility for the handling of protected disclosures.  Representatives were drawn from all Departments and key stakeholders, including local authorities, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Six meetings of the committee were held between October 2018 and March 2019.  Topics considered by the committee included confidentially and record-keeping, data protection and freedom of information and the operation of disclosure channels following upon protected disclosure, interactions with other workplace policies and reporting obligations.  Arising from these discussions, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will, in the coming months, issue a number of guidance notes, to assist public bodies in dealing with certain common issues that have arisen in dealing with protected disclosures.  Priority will be given to guidance dealing with disclosures concerning misconduct by a head of an organisation, balancing the obligation of confidentiality with effective follow-up of a disclosure and reporting obligations under the Act.  In addition, and as highlighted in the statutory review, there is a need to update the list of competent authorities designated to receive protected disclosures under section 7 of the 2014 Act, and work on a drafting order is currently being advanced.<\/p>  <p>  I would add that European legislation is now being developed on protected disclosures and we are very much involved in that and are monitoring it closely.  We may need to make amendments to our domestic legislation depending on how that EU legislation lands and how it might require us to change ours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900025#X00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1562688000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>At six minutes, we have only a short while left.

In budget 2019, almost 35% of the total voted expenditure of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was allocated to supporting sustainable mobility.  I fully agree with the Deputy that we need to increase that level of funding in the years ahead.  I am sure she will welcome the increases I have secured in the allocations for sustainable mobility in the coming years as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The capital allocation is scheduled to increase by approximately 48% next year and by a further 46% in 2021.  On current expenditure, the subvention levels have increased substantially in recent years.  There has been a 36% increase in the past four years.  A total of &euro;287 million is being provided this year.  This increased subvention is supporting improved services in urban and rural areas.  The increased services are allowing more people to make the shift to public transport, with a 7.5% increase in passenger numbers recorded last year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will acknowledge that a number of important projects are under way or are scheduled to start this year.  The continued expansion of the bus fleet will add more capacity to bus networks across the country.  I could also mention a number of significant active travel projects in our major cities, like the Royal Canal greenway in Dublin, the Harley Street bridge in Cork and the Parnell Street project in Limerick.  Trams on the Luas green line are being extended, with the first of the newly extended 55 m trams due to enter service after the summer.  We are increasing funding for the maintenance and renewal of the national rail network by 23% this year to help to deliver improved journey times and reliability on the network.  A new national train control centre will commence construction later in the year.  The city centre resignalling project will deliver increased rail capacity when it has been completed.  We are continuing to fund the planning and design of the transformative projects planned under the BusConnects, MetroLink and DART expansion investment programmes.

The plan clearly recognises that Ireland must step up significantly its commitments to address climate disruption.  A wide-ranging set of bold and challenging actions for transport are set out, particularly with regard to active travel - cycling and walking - and public transport.  I want to make sure we will provide high quality cycling and walking infrastructure, as well as a reliable public transport system, to make public and active travel options a viable alternative for as many people as possible and more of their journeys than ever before.  In that way, we will lower climate-harmful emissions, begin to tackle congestion and see an improvement in local air quality. <br\/><br\/>The plan includes our commitment to deliver an additional 500,000 public transport and active travel journeys daily by 2035.  This is a significant step-up in our ambition and requires expanding the capacity and attractiveness of walking and cycling networks, as well as the public transport system.  Under Project Ireland 2040, we have assigned &euro;8.6 billion to support sustainable mobility.  In addition to support for key public transport projects, this investment will vastly improve cycling and walking infrastructure in all major cities.  In fact, the &euro;8.6 billion investment budget is well above what we will be investing in new roads, which is a reversal of the balance of investment in the past.  In the period from 2018 to 2021, inclusive, &euro;110 million will be specifically dedicated to cycling and walking infrastructure in major urban areas; &euro;750 million is earmarked for the BusConnects programme in Dublin to include the delivery of around 200 km of segregated cycling lanes; and &euro;53 million will be used to support the development of new greenways.  This will support the increasing numbers who choose cycling as their preferred mode of transport, including e-bike users.  It is clear that prioritising investment in cycling networks is working.  The number of annual cycling trips is increasing, particularly within the greater Dublin area, with surveys such as the Canal Cordon Count showing cycling numbers almost doubling between 2011 and 2018. <br\/><br\/>We need to build on this and do even more.  Key actions under the climate plan underpin the commitment to increasing cycling as a mode of travel, including the establishment of a cycling project office within the National Transport Authority and the development of implementation plans and increased cycling infrastructure in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. <br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Cycling Project Office will ensure the new cycling infrastructure is delivered optimally, in line with the significantly increased funding being provided. <br\/><br\/>The cycle to work scheme continues to encourage the use of bicycles and e-bikes to travel to and from work.  Under the scheme, an eligible employer can buy a bicycle for his or her employees and the employee pays the amount, less the tax relief, over up to 12 months through a salary sacrifice arrangement.  Up to &euro;1,000 can be provided towards the purchase of a new bicycle or e-bike, which is a generous contribution towards the cost of any commuter bicycle but especially towards the cost of an e-bike which is generally more expensive.<br\/><br\/>The climate challenge needed a step up in ambition and a renewed determination across government and society to tackle climate disruption.  The climate action plan has given us the required level of focus and drive.  I am personally committed to the decarbonisation of the transport sector and hope to see transport emissions levels continue to fall, as they did in 2018.  Cycling will play an important role in the decarbonisation effort and I am dedicated to investing and improving the cycling network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900027#Z01400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562689800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>It is the cycling project office that terrifies me, given the record of the National Transport Authority in attempting to deliver the other landmark project within Project Ireland 2040, namely, BusConnects, but that is for another day.

I take the matter she raised seriously, as I do all attacks of this sort.  <\/p>  <p>  The safety and security of public transport staff and passengers, including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where appropriate.  While the vast majority of public transport passenger journeys occur without incident, I am concerned to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that, in 2018, 14 assaults on the company&rsquo;s staff were reported.  This was a slight fall on the 2017 total of 15 assaults on staff.  In the first six periods of 2019, there were five assaults on Irish Rail staff, compared to seven for the same period in 2018.  This is not to lighten the blow.  I take every one of these incidents seriously and am deeply concerned by what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Rail has also advised that it has undertaken a range of measures and proposes further measures to address anti-social behaviour on the rail network.  These include the recent announcement to pilot body cameras for ticket inspectors and customer services officers, increased security personnel, the introduction of customer service officers on all intercity routes and enhanced CCTV coverage.<\/p>  <p>  A new text alert service will also be introduced shortly to enable customers to discreetly report anti-social behaviour incidents and allow security personnel, garda&iacute; or both to be alerted and dispatched as required to an incident.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the overall level of anti-social behaviour incidents involving Dublin Bus was down 18% in 2018 and was down by 14% in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the first quarter of 2018.  The number of physical assaults on staff so far this year is 26 compared to 22 in the same period last year.<\/p>  <p>  The entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras with up to ten internal cameras and two external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet.

All Bus &Eacute;ireann and public service vehicles should be retrofitted with security screens to prevent exactly the type of incident which happened last night to the driver I referred to.  There should be a transport police body, for which there have been calls for a long time.  Again, however, this has been passed from Billy to Jack.  Bus &Eacute;ireann should be cashless and its drivers should not be put in peril and be responsible for collecting fares.  There should be an assault payment scheme, similar to what operates in Dublin Bus.  The Minister is correct that Dublin Bus has much more security measures.  The same is now requested for Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister claimed such incidents have decreased.  In late 2018, a female driver was assaulted at Bus&aacute;ras, a driver was threatened with a knife outside Kilbeggan, a driver was robbed in Naas and members of the Garda were called to remove aggressive passengers in Naas.

The making of such by-laws is a reserved function of elected members.<\/p>  <p>  My Department issued updated guidelines for setting and managing speed limits in Ireland in 2015 to assist local authorities in setting special speed limits, taking account of relevant national policy and local circumstances, including road safety.  Provision was made for greater use of lower speed limits in urban areas.  This includes greater use of the 30 km\/h speed limit, as used widely in the EU, and 30 km\/h slow zones.  This corresponds to 20 mph, the lowest limit in the UK.  These slow zones can be introduced to increase safety for the most vulnerable on suitable roads, such as roads immediately adjacent to play areas.  Road authorities are asked to seriously consider lowering the speed limit from 50 km\/h to 30 km\/h in residential estates.  Since 2015, 30 km\/h speed limits have been applied in more than 6,400 housing estates.  Where a limit of 30 km\/h is being implemented, local authorities and community groups should consider applying slow zones.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been funding this programme of works since 2015.  Provision has also been made for a 20 km\/h speed limit.  The 20 km\/h speed limit should only be used in very limited circumstances, set out in the updated traffic signs manual.  It is not intended to replace the 30 km\/h speed limit as the norm in housing estates.  In addition, in 2013 my Department issued the design manual for urban roads and streets.  This provides for improved design to support traffic calming and safer interaction between road users by encouraging lower speeds on new roads in urban areas.  Apart from making provision for variable speed limits, I have no plans to review or to change the range of speed limits available to road authorities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900030#CC00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1562691000,"counter":531,"content":"<p>It is welcome that 6,400 housing estates have implemented signage for slow zones.

So far this year, almost 10,000 speeding offences have been prosecuted, so it is clear that speeding remains a serious problem.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Durkan probably remembers the debates we had in the Chamber with the former Deputy, Seamus Brennan, when he was Minister.

The Deputy can understand that, although he will the first to point out that 30 km\/h can be a killer in certain circumstances as well.  That justifies the use of the slow zones.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the speed limit reviews.  In recent years, the local authorities have been reviewing speed limits on rural roads in accordance with the 2015 speed limit guidelines.  It is a major exercise and he will be aware of it.  It should improve consistency in the application of speed limits across the country, which, in turn, should contribute to improved road safety.  I have written to local authorities to urge them to complete their speed limit reviews urgently and my officials have been pursuing them since.  I am pleased that as of April this year, 23 local authorities had completed their reviews, five were expecting completion in 2019 and only three were not clearly indicating completion this year.

I do not know if the routes the Deputy was quoting are Bus &Eacute;ireann's.  If they are, perhaps the individuals he is talking about did not have Leap cards.  My understanding is quite clear that any Bus &Eacute;ireann bus qualifies.  We can make that clear afterwards.  I can discuss it with the Deputy afterwards if he thinks I am wrong, but I do not think so because I asked for this advice before I came into the Chamber to make it absolutely clear.  If there is a misunderstanding there, we can clear it up very quickly.  It may be that they do not have the Leap cards or the children to whom the Deputy referred are referring to commercial routes.  Commercial routes have been asked to participate in this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am sympathetic to what the Deputy is saying.  If there is some sort of discrimination against children who take certain routes or use certain operators, I could appeal to them.  I cannot force them to do so, but I could appeal to them to extend the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900031#DD00600","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1562691600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>We can follow up on it afterwards.

Accordingly, the impact on reducing national CO2 emissions of converting public transport to lower emitting fleets will be limited, though positive and important.  Nevertheless, I believe in the leadership benefit of this move to low emission alternatives for public transport.  The change will help to promote and normalise the use of non-conventional, lower emitting fuels and technologies.<\/p>  <p>  A clear trajectory towards low emissions has been firmly established in the urban bus fleet.  In the short term, we are committed under Project Ireland 2040 to no longer purchasing diesel only buses for the urban public bus fleet from this month onwards.  Consequently, the NTA recently initiated a tender competition to award a framework agreement for the supply of double-deck diesel-electric hybrid buses.  To help inform a longer-term bus procurement strategy, my Department, together with the NTA, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, has undertaken a comprehensive series of low emission bus trials, which will be reported upon shortly.  Findings from this trial, alongside EU public fleet procurement requirements set out in the clean vehicles directive, together with ongoing market analysis and research, will collectively inform the NTA's approach to its bus purchase programme in the years ahead.  I expect that half of the public urban bus fleet will have moved to lower emitting alternatives by 2023, with full conversion by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  On the number of low emitting buses on order and to be delivered, I understand that the NTA&rsquo;s recent framework agreement has indicated that up to 600 buses could be purchased over its duration.  The framework will run for 30 months, with the option to extend by up to a further 30 months.  The figure of 600 is only indicative and the exact number of vehicles to be purchased will be decided by the NTA annually in line with replacement requirements, capacity needs and funding availability, as well as taking account of developments in other low emitting technologies. <\/p>  <p>  It might also interest the Deputy to note that a similar comprehensive programme of work is well under way to move the commuter rail fleet to low emitting alternatives.  We plan to electrify important, heavily used elements of the rail network by creating a full metropolitan area DART network for the greater Dublin area, which is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year.  It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge-Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, Luas and metro networks.  The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann recently commenced a procurement process for the establishment of a ten-year framework agreement for the purchase of the additional lower emitting rail fleet required for this expansion of the DART network. <\/p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will reduce the carbon footprint of the public transport fleet. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900033#FF00800","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1562692800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Let us keep it simple.

Surely buses are now being ordered for next year that will not have the benefit of the information coming from those trials.  Even today the Minister cannot tell me what types of buses are being trialled, never mind the outcomes of the trial.  We will purchase buses next year without the benefit of the trial, which should have taken place last year.

The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant county or city council in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from the councils' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for road improvement projects would have been considered as part of the specific improvement and strategic regional and local road grant schemes.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the recession meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.<\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but it will take some time to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason there is limited scope for funding projects under the specific and strategic grant programmes.  The primary focus is on implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in Project Ireland 2040.  Any additional projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the specific and strategic grant programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the public spending code and my Department's capital appraisal framework, and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.<\/p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process, a preliminary appraisal must be submitted for each proposed project.  In this context, the National Transport Authority's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area provides the overall policy framework for transport development in the region.  As part of the corridor options appraisal, the strategy considers the measures needed to meet travel demand on the economic Drogheda to Dublin city corridor and focuses largely on public transport options and improved rail services.  The proposed electrification of the rail line to Drogheda under Project Ireland 2040 reflects this approach.<\/p>  <p>  The draft preliminary appraisal received from Meath County Council regarding a bypass of Julianstown will therefore have to be considered with the above factors in mind.  Against the backdrop of the need for action to address climate change and limited resources, I am conscious that investment has to be focused on the projects which best deliver on the Government's overall policy priorities and this means looking critically at proposals for new roads where public transport is being enhanced and where investment has been already made in high quality infrastructure, such as the M1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900034#GG00700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1562693400,"counter":579,"content":"<p>The report assessed four separate solutions, as well as a \"do nothing\" scenario, and the bypass of Julianstown emerged as the preferred option not only in the multi-criteria analysis but also in the preliminary cost-benefit analysis.

The key factors used in arriving at the relevant score for each application include the likelihood of increasing participation and improving performance, or both; whether the proposed facilities will be shared with other users; the level of socioeconomic disadvantage in the area; the technical merits of the proposed project; the level of funding being provided for the project by the applicant; and the level of sports capital programme funding received in the last ten years by the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  There were 2,337 applications received by the deadline, 186 of which were for projects that were deemed to be invalid in the 2017 round of applications.

Previously, some would have been picked and prioritised, even though they had not score as well as others.

However, at the lower end of awards made, for equipment-only applications such as mowing equipment and maintenance machinery, I am not sure the index is useful.  If a club needs new machinery to cut grass, the level of socioeconomic deprivation is not as relevant as it would be if a club was, for example, seeking to have a new all-weather pitch or build a multi-use facility.  I ask the Minister of State to look again at the scheme because some applications for smaller awards are falling through the cracks.  I believe the heavy weighting given to the socioeconomic indicator is a key reason for this.  The scheme could be amended by using the socioeconomic criterion in considering applications for grants in big amounts and a slightly different equation in considering equipment-only applications.

One of the key things about the use of the Pobal deprivation index is that a blunt instrument was used previously where an applicant fell or did not under either the CL&Aacute;R programme or the RAPID programme and the different categories within them.  The Pobal deprivation index is more specific.  One of the failures of the deprivation index is where a club serves a large catchment area and its co-ordinates are in an advantaged area, yet its membership is drawn predominantly from disadvantaged backgrounds.  I am the first to say it is not a perfect system, but we must have some way of including levels of disadvantage in the application process.<\/p>  <p>  I hear what the Deputy is saying about equipment-only applications.  The logic behind the application of the Pobal deprivation index in all aspects of the programme is that fund-raising capacity and ability in communities tends to be lower where there are higher levels of disadvantage.  That is the mentality, whether it be for a large or a smaller grant.  I see where the Deputy is coming from when he says people are at a disadvantage by not being disadvantaged and that they are less likely to receive higher amounts of funding.  In general, the logic is that clubs are in a better position to raise finances from their membership if it is drawn predominantly from a non-disadvantaged area.  We will be carrying out a review in advance of the putting in place of the 2019 programme and I will be very happy to take on board what the Deputy has said.

It provides jobs and much for Dublin and the east coast as a whole, as the Minister and I both know and appreciate.  However, there are some ongoing noise issues in communities in the locality surrounding the airport.  Residents of places in Santry such as Santry Close, Royal Oak and Turnapin have ongoing issues with noise from low flying aircraft.  Incidents are occurring at night time and disturbing sleep for many.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, appears, in effect, to be fobbing off complaints.  It is stating the flights late at night and early in the morning are by empty aeroplanes returning to base.  Of course, it does not matter if a aeroplane is empty or full as far as the individuals and households beneath them are concerned.  They are still flying over their houses and making the same amount of noise because the engines are still of the same size.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister met a number of residents from the affected area of Turnapin in October 2016.  He promised to assist and the residents received him warmly, as he received them.  The meeting was very constructive.  Nevertheless, things have not progressed since.  As the crow flies, Turnapin is closer to the noise paths and contours of the airport than many other areas which are receiving much more assistance from the DAA.  I hope the Minister can encourage it to expand the noise insulation programme to include residents in Turnapin in Santry.  I also hope he can use his considerable influence and the weight of his office to impress on the DAA the need to do this.  It would be the right thing to do.<\/p><p>On 27 June, DAA held a drop-in clinic.  Residents were given only two days' notice and my office was not given any formal notice.  I only found out by chance on social media.  Nevertheless, by DAA's own admission, the clinic attracted a higher turnout than many other local clinics where this insulation programme already exists.  This is clearly a pressing issue for communities such as Turnapin, Royal Oak and Santry Close.  <\/p> <p> Dublin Airport's new runway is ambitious, and is part of the airport's growth and the success story of the airport, of Dublin tourism and the economy's bounce-back.  However, there are also concerns about the impact this will have on local communities with more flights, noise and hours.  Perhaps there will be more broken promises on night-time flights.  There are concerns that DAA might apply for 24-7 operations, which would mean low-flying aircraft over residential areas in the middle of the night, which already occurs but is explained away as their being empty, rather than full, aircraft, which makes no difference.  Residents have been unimpressed by Fingal County Council's appointment as noise regulator.  They do not believe it will make a difference.  Will the Minister explain how it will?  Residents believe there is a conflict of interest as the council is receiving rates from the airport and therefore is one of the greatest beneficiaries of the airport being in the council area but the council is also charged with regulating the airport.

I fully appreciate the effect that excessive aircraft noise has on communities.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Act was signed into law on 22 May 2019.  The main purpose of that Act is to manage noise at Dublin Airport and to give applicability to EU Regulation No. 598\/2014, which sets out the rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at European Union airports.  The Act provides, for the first time, that noise generated by aircraft activity at Dublin Airport will be subject to extensive, detailed assessment, to ongoing monitoring and to regular review.  I raised the bar in relation to what the DAA, as the operator of Dublin Airport, is required to do to comply with noise rules.  The Act is about ensuring the sustainable development of the airport, which balances the ambitions of the DAA, the needs of business and tourism interests and the rights of local residents.  The Act respects existing planning and development and environmental laws and is underpinned by binding EU regulations and directives on environmental and aircraft noise.  It ensures that every time a planning application at Dublin Airport is considered, the aircraft noise implications are considered also.<\/p>  <p>  Fingal County Council has been designated as the independent noise regulator for Dublin Airport.  Any decision on noise to be made by the council, in this role as noise regulator, will be evidenced-based and will be fully in adherence with the requirements of national law and EU regulations.  The process, as provided for in the Act, requires that at least once every five years the noise regulator will undertake an assessment of the noise situation at the airport.  This will include taking into account any future developments planned at the airport.  Where the noise regulator identifies a noise problem on foot of that assessment, it will adopt the so-called balanced approach.<\/p>  <p>  The balanced approach allows the regulator to decide what steps need to be taken by the DAA to offset the impact of such noise.  It might mean more home insulation, adjustments to flight paths or it might require physical works to act as sound barriers.  That will be a matter for the regulator following its detailed assessment.  Importantly, this process will be open and transparent.<\/p>  <p>There will be public consultation and at each stage, the regulator will be required to publish information and evidence and keep all stakeholders abreast of developments.  The decision of the regulator will be accompanied by a report detailing how the decision was reached, which will include a non-technical summary.  I would like to clarify that the Act must be read in tandem with EU Regulation No. 598\/2014 and with EU Directive No. 2002\/49\/ EC, the environmental noise directive, because the noise regulator must have regard to all three of these in carrying out its regulatory assessment of noise.  <\/p>  <p>  The Act, therefore, sets out a process for a noise regulation regime that allows for full stakeholder engagement, along with an independent appeals process, which will provide certainty to stakeholders.  The Act sets out a structured approach to assessing and addressing aircraft noise at Dublin Airport with the objective of facilitating airport development and expansion in a way that minimises, as far as practicable, the noise impact of that expansion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900036#JJ00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1562694600,"counter":598,"content":"<p>The Minister has said that every time there is a planning application at the airport, the implications for noise are also considered.

Questionnaires submitted to the residents and their families relayed positive comments about staff at the centre.  One resident summed it up by stating the staff were very friendly and provided a welcoming home from home atmosphere.  Clients further commented that Sruth&aacute;n House has given them back their lives.  Family members have said the facility is invaluable and that clients look forward to the next day when leaving Sruth&aacute;n House.  Sruth&aacute;n House allows those with physical and sensory disabilities to meet new people and get a few days away from home.  It is simply irreplaceable.<\/p> <p> The HSE's letter went on to invite clients and family members to discuss their concerns about the proposed changes.  The letter began by stating it will close in December this year and suddenly decided to invite staff to discuss the proposed changes.  It was a cold, crass letter telling these people with disabilities they are losing the respite service in their community after 20 years.  They are simply not in a position to travel the distances in question.<\/p> <p> I am aware of the commitment of the Minister of State to disability services and two disability service houses have been opened, in Balbriggan and Dundalk, to which he committed.  I ask him to tell me the sense in providing two new facilities while closing an excellent service.  It does not make sense and corrective action needs to be taken before December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900036#JJ00900","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562695200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for the opportunity to outline the position on Sruth&aacute;n House.  The Government&rsquo;s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.   We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities, which will empower them to live independent lives.  This commitment is outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Respite services are an important part of the range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families.  Short breaks can also provide an opportunity for individuals to meet new people, widen their social circle and gain new experiences.  Respite care is crucial in helping to reduce family stress, preserve the family unit and provide stability.  The need for increased respite services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with all service providers to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its ongoing service provision, the HSE will provide more than 182,500 respite nights and 32,662 day respite sessions to families in need throughout the country this year.  In 2018, there was a significant improvement in respite provision, as the Deputy mentioned.  An additional &euro;10 million was provided to fund 12 new respite houses, which are up and running.  This is one in each HSE CHO area and three additional houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the high demand for respite in this area.  These houses provide additional respite for families that need it.  All 12 houses are now open and fully operational.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;2 million of the additional money is being targeted at alternative respite services.  These are practical and important solutions.  Alternative respite is working well locally, with good examples of summer camps, evening and Saturday clubs having taken place, benefitting hundreds of adults and children.  Further additional respite initiatives are planned for 2019 in each HSE CHO area.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Sruth&aacute;n House and Louth disability services, I found out earlier from the HSE that Louth disability services are prioritising the provision of services to enhance cost efficiency and continuous quality improvement in line with the best standard practice.  The residential respite service at Sruth&aacute;n House will, therefore, cease operation by the end of December 2019.  To facilitate this transition, Louth disability services are reviewing respite service delivery and have invited the service users be a part of this process to identify what service will best meet their individual and family needs.  Louth disability services remain committed to providing services to people with physical and sensory needs and will continue to offer respite through a number of options.  These include a number of respite services in different locations, such as Woodhaven House, which is a supported holiday facility in Sligo for people with MS, Cuisle, which is the Irish Wheelchair Association's national holiday centre in Roscommon and the Carmel Fallon Centre, which is the Irish Wheelchair Association's holiday centre in Dublin.  Services will be provided but, of course, this will all be done in consultation with all the families of people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900037#KK00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1562695200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister of State with regard to disability services but I am terribly disappointed by the response.

Cost containment is the reason for the closure.  It is all about cost containment and budgetary measures and not about the people who need the services.  If we do not get to grips with this, the vulnerable people in disability services will further suffer.  Closing this facility, which caters for those with physical and sensory disabilities, is a direct result of a health budget that is being allowed to overrun.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why we speak about providing new services, and we are all for that, but then dissipate and restrict services for the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>  <p>  It is in the hands of the Minister of State to get to grips with what management is being dictated to deliver at the expense of people in my community and beyond.  I am quite sure that before the end of this year, these services and others will be cut unless provision is made to meet the shortfall that will exist in the budget, which I am confident, I am sad to say, will be in excess of &euro;132 million.

In fact, it is about improving services and the quality of the services.  It is about making the best use of current resources.

This is an effort to get to the bottom of where exactly in the process stands the proposed increase in the fund.  As the Minister of State is well aware, the initial fund of &euro;200 million which has been in place since early 2018 is not going to be anywhere near enough to meet demand.  The Government has stated it has been surprised by the uptake and the level of interest.  I do not see why it should be surprised.  If it is in a position to provide people with a long-term guarantee on the interest rate, for example - it is an attractive rate - and also prepared to examine loan applications from people who are unable to access a mortgage at the level they need from a bank, it is no surprise that the level of interest in and demand for the scheme is very high.<\/p>  <p>  Roughly since January this year, it has been evident that more money is going to be needed.  We have been hearing since from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that he has requested an extra &euro;200 million each year for the next three years.  That means that an extra &euro;600 million will be required and it would be additional borrowing by the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  We were told that the Central Bank was to be consulted and it was.  I put this issue to Governor Lane when he came before the Oireachtas finance committee in March.  In essence, he confirmed that there was no objection from the Central Bank on the grounds of financial stability, given the relatively insignificant amount of money involved in the context of the overall mortgage market.  That hurdle was cleared.  Therefore, I am at a loss to know why we still do not have clarity on the eve of the D&aacute;il going into recess.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will no doubt reply by stating the scheme is operating as normal and that all applications are being considered and approved and that funding is being drawn down, but that has not been the case in full in recent months.  Some local authorities have publicly stated they are no longer accepting applications.  The Minister intervened.  He responded in the D&aacute;il and issued an instruction to the local authorities.  They must accept applications, process them and continue to approve grants which will continue to be drawn down.  However, his cannot go on forever.  If we examine the figures, about 4,200 applications were assessed up to the end of May and slightly more than half have been approved.  A fraction of the approved grants have been drawn down.  The overall sum drawn down is about &euro;140 million.  There is not, therefore, enough money in the pot to meet the funding requirements of approved applicants.  I know that there is a time lag and that it can take a while for people to go through the process and be ready to draw down the money.  However, that day is coming.  There is a suspicion that the consideration of applications has been slowed down because there is a squeeze on funding.  I want the Minister of State to give a categorical assurance to the House that all local authorities are open for applications, accepting them, processing them, issuing approvals and that loans are being drawn down unimpeded.  <\/p>  <p>  I turn to my real purpose.  When are we going to have clarity on whether the extra funding of &euro;600 million will be approved?  We know that the Central Bank does not have an objection to it.  We also know that the HFA has access to credit and can draw down additional moneys.

Prior to its launch, an initial tranche of &euro;200 million of long-term fixed rate finance was borrowed by the HFA to provide funds for the scheme for local authorities.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme is a remodel of two previous schemes provided by local authorities, namely, the house purchase loan and home choice loan schemes.  As originally conceived, the expected take-up under the scheme is limited, at around 1,000 mortgages over three years.  It was envisaged that the loans should not contribute to increasing demand for homes, given that the number of borrowers eligible for the loan scheme would be restricted by the loan criteria and the overall scale of the measure was so limited.  It was also agreed that a loan to value ratio of 90%, as per the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules, would apply to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  Risk related to funding the scheme is managed, with the HFA providing long-term fixed rate hedged finance and the scheme being limited to &euro;200 million over three years.<\/p>  <p>  From the data collected to date, it is clear that there has been greater demand for the scheme than initially anticipated.  As a result, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA for it to continue.  Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government have been engaging on the matter since October 2018 and in January this year the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government communicated its intention to seek sanction for additional funding to manage the demand which had far exceeded the expected original 1,000 mortgages over three years.  Prior to the submission of a request for sanction, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government conducted a review to ascertain if there was scope to make changes to the operation of the scheme to achieve greater efficiency and consistency and also to determine the timelines for applications being processed by the local authorities.  Further details of the review can be obtained from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the review, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform consulted the Central Bank and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the impact and size of the scheme in the overall market.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government consulted the local authorities to estimate the additional funding required and subsequently submitted a request for sanction to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 14 June.  The request is subject to the normal deliberations afforded to any request of such a nature, which would include general Government balance and debt considerations in the context of a uniquely challenging budgetary scenario for 2020.  Notwithstanding the submission of a request for additional funding, the scheme remains open to applications to all local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  It is the role of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform to deliver sustainable public finances.  In that regard, the Minister and his officials are finalising the assessment, with a view to announcing a further tranche of funding very soon.

Its population has increased by more than 5% between the censuses in 2011 and 2016.  Moreover, very significant construction activity is finally beginning to take place.  There is also an increase in the number of people back at work but unfortunately, too many of them are in precarious or low-paid work.  They are, nonetheless, back at work and all of this means a growing demand for childcare.<\/p>  <p>  Currently in Dublin Mid-West, there is significant new construction in Adamstown, Newcastle, Rathcoole and Clondalkin.  I am getting increasing numbers of representations from working families, often where both parents are working, who find it a real struggle to even get access to childcare, let alone to afford it.  Many of our community-run childcare facilities are at capacity, certainly in their morning sessions, and are almost at full capacity in the afternoons.  There was one unfortunate case recently, which is ongoing, of a private sector operator and the service provider changed following a competitive tender.  The new service provider discovered that in fact the service they had inherited had more children in it than recommended by the Tusla guidelines.  As a consequence, the new provider is now restricting some of the service to meet the Tusla guidelines.  This has highly negative consequences for parents with the withdrawal of collections, drop-offs and so on.  This speaks to a very high level of demand and unfortunately not an adequate level of supply.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that these pressures exist in many parts of the country but Dublin Mid-West is unique in that it has two strategic development zones.  I believe we are the only constituency in the State that has those, with anything as much as 6,000 to 7,000 additional accommodation units to be provided in Adamstown over the coming years.  The Clonburris strategic development zone, following An Bord Plean&aacute;la's determination, could have between 8,000 and 11,000 units of accommodation over the next decade.  Kilcarbery, a council site and a joint venture in Clondalkin will have more than 1,000 units.  Only yesterday at its full council meeting, South Dublin County Council announced a significant increase in potential accommodation units in Rathcoole.  Many of those units will start to be built next year or the year after that.  While we have a very low level of community childcare provision - only 10% of the quantum available - whether it is the community end or the private end, it cannot happen or develop without the active support of the Minister and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>  <p>  Today I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say, albeit not on the overall State-wide figures, because I have seen some of those in replies to parliamentary questions.  What can the Minister tell Deputies from Dublin Mid-West and to the parents who make representations to us?  As our community expands, I welcome affordable, social housing and appropriately-priced private housing to meet the existing and future needs of our community.  What is being done by the Minister, her Department and her officials and what will they do to work with community providers, private providers, the local authority and other networks in Dublin Mid-West to ensure the current unmet need will be met?  As our community and constituency grows, what will be the future Government investments in childcare strategies to meet the needs of the growing population, including a growing population of working families with children?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900039#MM00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1562696400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for raising this issue.  I will restrict my comments to the questions relating to my Ministry, although I heard the Deputy raise some other issues there also.<\/p>  <p>  To provide some context for this discussion I will start by stating that I have been fortunate to secure an unprecedented increase of 117% in investment for early learning and care and school age childcare in recent budgets.  This extra investment has supported a doubling of capacity in the sector.  It is clear, however, that further capacity is required and that is why I am continuing my intensive efforts in this area.<\/p>  <p>  One of the priorities for my Department&rsquo;s capital programme is supporting childcare providers to extend their existing services, or to establish new services, where need or demand exists.  The decision on where to target capital spending to support policy aims is informed by an analysis of the current state of the childcare sector, by learnings from previous capital programmes and by feedback and input from stakeholders, including childcare providers and data from Pobal and other sources.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific areas mentioned by the Deputy, while my Department&rsquo;s capital programmes do not routinely target one specific geographic area over any other, the assessment of capital applications has regard to issues of need supported by the use of specialised assessment tools, including Pobal&rsquo;s geosparcity index.  This is considered the fairest mechanism to meet the needs of all areas having regard to the available funds.  All applications are appraised in a fair and impartial manner and solely on the basis of the quality of their application.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s 2019 early years capital scheme has a primary focus on building places for the under-threes.  I have made &euro;4 million available for this age group, which is expected to result in 1,321 new places for the zero to three age group being created.  An additional &euro;1 million has been made available for the creation of 2,308 new school age places.<\/p>  <p>  On childminding, I was delighted to secure &euro;500,000 in budget 2019 to recruit a national childminding co-ordinator and a team of six development officers in the State, to support the registration of more childminders with Tusla, and thus enable them access subsidies under the national childcare scheme.  My Department will publish a childminding action plan in the coming months to follow through on the commitments in the First 5 strategy and the programme for Government to further develop the childminding sector.<\/p>  <p>  With capacity issues more generally, each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to childcare services in Ireland, including capacity.  The latest early years sector profile report, based on a survey completed in May 2018, outlines a 4% vacancy rate as a percentage of children enrolled in Dublin.  Pobal reports that nationally, the trend for waiting lists suggests a reduction in waiting lists for older children and an increase for under-twos.  Pobal cautions that its data on waiting lists cannot be used on their own to inform capacity decisions, as parents often place their children on more than one waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, if the Deputy is aware of any specific cases of parents - and he may have identified one or two - who are having difficulty accessing childcare places, they could make contact with their local city or county childcare committee, which will be pleased to assist them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900039#MM00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1562696400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>If I was any one of the parents who raised these matters on a regular basis with constituency Deputies, the first thing I would ask after the Minister's intervention would be what does it mean for the particular area to which this question pertains.  My Topical Issue matter is very specifically focused on the Dublin Mid-West constituency.<\/p>  <p>  It strikes me that while the capital sums are welcome, they are very small in the context of the level of demand.  While the way in which the State assists the provision of childcare, through capital and current expenditure, is not the same as education, at least the Department of Education and Skills proactively undertakes assessments of existing need and future population projections.  That Department looks at a whole range of elements such as city and county development plans, planning permissions, strategic development zones and so on.  On that basis the Department of Education and Skills is able to make strategic decisions about the targeting of limited resources in order that the resources go to the areas on a proportional basis to meet that need.  I do not have anything close to the level of expertise as does the Minister on how this works but from the Minister's response, this is not the way the current allocation of resources takes place. <\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>While people who apply must demonstrate a level of need, it does not necessarily mean that if there is a greater level of need in certain geographical areas, the people there can access a proportionately greater sum from the funds.  I stress again that I accept absolutely that childcare is an issue in every part of the State.  However, in two strategic development zones in Dublin Mid-West, up to 20,000 additional public, affordable and private housing units are to be provided over the coming decade.  We are already hearing from community and private providers that they are at capacity.  I will forward to the Minister privately details of the instance in which we actually had overcapacity, presumably because a childcare provider tried to meet a need, albeit in very difficult circumstances.  What I would like to hear in the Minister's short response, given what she has said about the position across the State, is what she can say to reassure Deputies and, crucially, parents in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West that her efforts in the coming weeks and months will produce increased provision which is so desperately needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900039#MM00800","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562697000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>In his initial presentation and in his subsequent intervention, I heard the Deputy make the point that he has concerns about current capacity in his constituency as well as outlining the implications for future capacity of plans to expand housing, etc.  To look a bit more at current capacity and unmet needs, one of the ways the Department gets its information, which is perhaps different from the Department of Education and Skills, on which I take the Deputy's point and at which I will look, has to do with the city or county childcare committees.  It is the childcare committees that are in touch with local childcare providers.  I am keen to avoid having an area in which there is a significant level of unmet need even currently.  That is what I usually say and if there is a real problem, the providers should go to the childcare committees.  If the Deputy has specific concerns, he can come directly to me.  My Department has been fairly good at trying to be responsive and flexible in finding ways to provide support.  The Deputy must accept at the same time that the physical capacity for expansion must exist in terms of capital, and I tried to answer some of those questions, as well as the capacity among providers, with reference to which we assess the quality.  While future needs are an issue as well, some of the issues with current capacity relate to the amount of money that is available to respond.  That money is limited although it is growing.  That gets to the Deputy's question about the future.  It is really important to identify those zones that are coming up and the incredible increase in capacity that will be needed.  We are aware of that.  One of things I did not mention in the initial reply was that we had secured in the NDP funding commitment from 2023 to 2028 a significant amount of &euro;250 million.  We will follow a similar course in determining future needs to the one we have followed before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900040#NN00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement: Statements (Resumed)","time":1562697000,"counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900040#NN00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1562697000,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Following the opening round of discussion on the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, which concluded on Wednesday, 3 July 2019, we proceed to the second round of the debate, which consists of questions and answers.

As a small, open island economy, we depend on our openness to trade, without which we would not survive.  However, it is important that we trade with countries which apply the same standards and regulatory requirements as we do.  As part of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, however, we are now proposing to deal with a country that clears an area of the Amazon rainforest the size of a football pitch every hour of every day.  What does that say about the environment?  When it comes to beef, it is a country with no database or traceability and in which growth promoters are widely available.  However, I will leave that matter to my colleague, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture.<\/p>  <p>  I would appreciate if the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation could be tight in reply to the following specific questions.  In reply to a parliamentary question I submitted last week, the Minister confirmed that as negotiations proceeded, member states were consulted on an ongoing basis.  What was the level of consultation the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, had with the Commission?  At any stage during the recent discussions on the &euro;50 million to help Irish beef farmers, did it raise its head that 99,000 tonnes of beef would be coming into the EU?  Given the recent positive focus on the environment in Ireland and at EU level, did the Government question or raise concerns about the abuse of the tropical Amazonian rainforest and the impact of its deforestation on the global environment?  The Government spoke last year about the appointment of a trade modelling firm of Copenhagen economists to carry out an assessment of the EU-Mercosur agreement.  That assessment is to be updated in light of the new draft proposals.  When can we expect the economic assessment to be published?  When can we expect the environmental assessment to be published?  It is worth noting that there is significant economic potential from the perspective of our pharmaceutical sector, which accounts for 55% of our exports, and IT and software, in which sector we are the second largest producer in the world.<\/p>  <p>  My final question relates to the report of the National Competitiveness Council which was launched in April 2019.  According to the executive summary of the report, if prices in Ireland are too high relative to productivity, it damages Ireland's competitiveness, making it more difficult for Irish businesses to export.  The summary further states that the evidence is clear that Ireland is a high-cost economy.  In 2017, Ireland was the fifth most expensive economy in the EU and prices were 13% higher than the EU average.  What is the Minister doing to tackle high costs for businesses in Ireland?  The Government is talking about promoting a trade deal, but it will be very difficult to trade with any country when we are coming from a base of such high utilities costs, costs of credit and business services and input costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900040#NN00500","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1562697000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>On the first opportunity I have had to do so, I congratulate Deputy Troy on his appointment as spokesman on business, enterprise and innovation.  The Deputy has raised a number of questions and I will try to address them.  I appreciate fully and recognise the concerns of beef farmers on this deal.  It is important to remember that the deal has been negotiated at EU level where the Government has consistently raised serious concerns in relation to beef access over a long period.  I raised the matter at every opportunity at European Trade Council meetings as well as directly with the trade Commissioner, Ms Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  As recently as 31 May 2019, I wrote to the Commissioner to highlight once again Ireland's concerns in relation to beef.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, raised the matter with his EU counterparts also and the Taoiseach joined with a number of other EU Heads of Government from France, Poland and Belgium to express our concerns to President Juncker.  The Government has sought in every way to achieve the best possible deal for our farmers.  It is important to remember that the Mercosur countries were looking initially for a beef quota of 300,000 tonnes whereas the draft agreement provides for a quota of 99,000 tonnes.  While that is still a higher volume than we want, it is less than a third of what was originally sought.  The quota is also split between fresh and frozen product and will be phased in over a period of six years from the date of finalisation of the agreement in its legal form, which is likely to be two years from now.<\/p><p>I know that other figures were mentioned.  There was an historic offer at one time.  I understand that in 2004, an offer of 130,000 tonnes was on the table from the EU.  In 2004, the Commission offered 130,000 tonnes.  Now it is down to 99,000 tonnes.  The Government acknowledges that the agreement on beef access that has been reached provides for more imports than we would have wished.  However, the level of access that has been agreed is far less than Mercosur was looking for.  As Deputies will be aware, it was looking for 300,000 tonnes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900040#NN00600","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562697600,"counter":631,"content":"<p>With due respect, I do not have much time left and I would like the Minister to address the other matters I raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900041#OO00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1562697600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want me to answer the question about competitiveness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900041#OO00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1562697600,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I want the Minister to answer the questions I asked about competitiveness, the environment and the economic assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900041#OO00400","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1562697600,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Very well.

The detailed chapter in the agreement on sustainable development goals recognises the need to address the urgent threat of climate change and the role of trade in that regard.

The beef, poultry and pigmeat sectors, and agriculture in general, are being asked to carry the burden of this deal in order that other sectors of the economy can benefit.  From an Irish point of view, this deal is not well-weighted, fair or in our interests.  The Government has failed politically, particularly when one considers that the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development is an Irishman.  He has overseen the drawing up of a deal that will result in 99,000 tonnes of beef, 180,000 tonnes of poultry and 25,000 tonnes of pigmeat being imported into the EU.  We know that 55% of the 99,000 tonnes of beef that will be imported will be frozen beef and 45% of it will be fresh beef.

We are all on board with that.<\/p><p>The Mercosur trade deal has been in the making for 20 years and the Minister said it is not a done deal.  It had better not be a done deal because farmers in my part of the country experienced the sellout of the sugar beet industry under previous Governments due to international trade deals.  Is the beef industry going to go the same way?  The truth, which the Minister knows as well as I do, is that beef farmers are hanging on by their fingertips.  <\/p><p>I will focus on economic, environmental and human rights issues.  Regarding environmental matters, we know what is happening in those countries.  We have signed up to the Paris Agreement.  The EU and the Government are talking out of both sides of their mouths if they sign up to this deal as it is.  We cannot say we are going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and import beef from the far side of the world.  It is the same as shifting ice to the North Pole where they do not need it.  We use only 10% of what we produce.  A total of 90% is exported and that is good and must continue.  How will the EU police what is happening in the likes of Brazil where criminal gangs are clearing people off lands to make way for beef barons to take over?  How will the environmental standards in Brazil be policed when the few that exist are totally ignored?  <\/p><p>I read Commissioner Hogan's article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last Friday where he briefly mentioned labour and environmental protection but did not go on to say how these would be protected.  Brazil's president is one of the most authoritarian and right-wing people in the world.  How will the workers in the beef industry and farm workers be protected?  They will not be protected because there is no means of protecting them and we are adding to their exploitation by facilitating this so I want the Minister to address this issue.  Has she put this to the European Commission and colleagues in Europe regarding the protection of the environment in South America and the rainforest and the protection of agricultural workers, including those in the beef producing countries?  Those workers have no protection whatsoever and if we allow this deal to go through, matters will get even worse.  Could the Minister address those issues?  We have signed up to the Paris Agreement and are asking farmers in this country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  This House has rightly declared a climate emergency but we cannot do that and engage in deals such as this, which will cause problems and create even more emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900042#PP00400","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1562698200,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Regarding labour conditions, the parties to the agreement agree that there should be no lowering of labour or environmental standards to attract trade and investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900042#PP00500","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1562698200,"counter":671,"content":"<p>They are on the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900042#PP00600","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1562698200,"counter":672,"content":"<p>They also agree that the trade agreement should not constrain the right to regulate on environmental or labour matters, including in situations where scientific information is not conclusive.

In Ireland, most farmers know their cattle almost by walking up and petting them.  The situation here is entirely different.  How will disease be managed and how will we know it is managed?  It is legal to use growth hormones in Mercosur countries.  I understand that they will not be allowed under this agreement.  How will we know they are not being allowed if cattle are not tagged or traced?  If nobody can have access to them to know where they are, how will we know that growth hormones are not being used?  By virtue of the scale at which they farm, disease control in Mercosur countries involves mass disease prevention where medicines are put into the food animals eat and all animals are medicated at once.  It will be impossible to monitor any of these farms at this distance.

Most Irish farmers with whom I engage say they will take on competition from anywhere, as long as the playing pitch is level and we are comparing like with like.  In that context, we need only recall the 2017 Brazilian meat scandal, the carne fraca scandal, with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar.  This gives rise to legitimate cause for concern.  Given that particular Brazilian exposure to shoddy practice, there is an opportunity for us in the context of a deal on outline arrangements to do with standards and environmental issues.  Apart from the meat scandal, we know also about the disregard for environmental conditions and the attitude of the current Brazilian Administration to the broader climate change agenda.  Accordingly, in many ways, we have been presented with an opportunity which we need to maximise.  It is on the basis that we stitch in absolute conditionality about market access.  We must negotiate to ensure there will not be access to our market, except if we are absolutely sure they meet our standards.<\/p>  <p>  As part of our access to the Chinese beef market, Chinese inspectors will be coming here in August to inspect additional plants which are awaiting approval.  We need to engage with the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, which is based in Grange, County Meath and the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, to ensure that, in the time before the document takes legal effect, we will guarantee that European consumers will be protected from any substandard product entering the market.  We must also ensure the terms and conditions on which the product seeks access are the same as for the use of veterinary medicines, including being hormone-free, traceability, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Therein lies the opportunity to level the playing pitch.  We know from experience that there are different production systems.  If they want access to our market, they have to comply.  There is the opportunity in the intervening period to allow us to stitch in the conditionality to make sure it is absolutely watertight.  We can ensure the conditions which I hope they will struggle to meet will thwart their ambition to deliver the 99,000 tonnes.  That is the challenge for all of us in the intervening period.  What we have is a headline agreement.  What is imperative is that in the intervening period, whether it be on quota segmentation, in the environmental chapter or phytosanitary issues, we use every lever we have at our disposal to make sure the competition, if it is to arrive, will be fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900043#QQ00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1562698800,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Once again, we have a situation where beef farmers are being crucified by the actions of the people we send to represent us in Brussels.

As a consequence we are exporting to those 180 different countries.  The EU recently concluded free trade agreements with Japan, Singapore, Mexico and Canada.

There are Brexit headwinds in the UK, where 70% of our beef is sold.  Unfortunately, our suckler herd is in trouble and prices for beef have been pulled again.  That is because of factories, Brexit and the climate debate.  Every time one turns on the television, the farmer is almost the villain of the world.  I walked down the street today to the Irish Farmers Association briefing.  The air I breathed today was an awful lot different to what I breathed last night at home.  It was totally different.  Before any cost-benefit analysis or anything else is done, there is a reality to consider.  Some 80,000 farmers, families, partners and children rely on the beef and suckler industry.  Most of them are from counties Donegal to Kerry and out to County Longford.  The sector has to be protected.  No matter how the maths or sums are done, there will be a wipeout if Brexit happens.  It will be one belt after another.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, spoke about doing deals with Cambodia.  From what I have read, the measures are similar to being shown a yellow card in a football match but a country can receive five yellow cards from the EU.  If a country indicates it will change this, that or the other, the EU will say \"Okay\" and the country can plod along again.  We know the history of the countries in question.  We know about the rotten meat and the lack of traceability.  They will sign up to everything and say they will do everything but they will cod the EU.  There is no point in saying it.

The South Americans can cut down forests the size of football pitches every minute and haul meat across the world.

We have the outline of an arrangement that must be given legal effect.  When we ultimately have a deal, it will be a decision for the Oireachtas at that stage.  My responsibility is to ensure that in that intervening period, we work with like-minded people and use the institutions of the European Union and the State to ensure we get to a point where we thwart, diminish and frustrate the ambition contained in that headline agreement so as to secure the best possible deal.  The best possible deal would bring a levelling of the playing pitch in order that the standards alluded to by the Deputy, including those pertaining to the environmental, traceability and veterinary medicine, would be the same as those applied to the product that is coming in to compete with us on EU supermarket shelves.  This is the challenge.<\/p>  <p>  In the intervening period we will of course do an appropriate assessment of the deal, investigating not only its economic impact but its environmental effect.  There is opportunity in that space to ensure the legal document ultimately drafted protects our farmers from unfair trade.  The ultimate ambition is to have fair trade and in the context of that fair trade, if we are not fighting with one hand behind our backs, our producers can compete with anybody.  I know that from the privilege I have had working on trade missions with people in the industry.  Our product is rightly respected as a high-value sustainable product, and it is in our long-term best interests to keep embracing that model of production.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been quite frank about this.  If we find with our assessment that the deal is not in our interests, we will try to forge alliances with others to ensure we can meet the required threshold for a qualified majority vote, QMV, at Council level.  In the interim, we must do the assessment and look at the detail of the outline agreement to see how we can try to influence that in the intervening period to deliver a legal text that would protect our interests and those of beef farmers in particular.  There are 100,000 family farms - not 80,000 - deriving some element of their income from the beef sector.  The critical mass of the Irish agricultural sector is involved with beef production.  People are also affected in the poultry, pork and dairy sectors, although some of these are affected in a positive sense.  The real exposure is to the beef sector. <\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach has said, we will do the assessment and take things from there.

Any deal with Mercosur is a shockingly bad deal for Ireland, including its beef, dairy, poultry and pig farmers.  I noted the Minister's comments earlier that this may not be a done deal and I sincerely hope it is not.  We should bear in mind that cattle in Brazil are not tagged and there is no database or traceability.

It is a contentious topic for any Deputy, but especially those from rural Ireland.  The breadth of the contributions reflects the scale of the issue, not only for individual beef farmers but for the rural economy generally.  It is probably not widely understood outside the rural economy that the multiplier effect for the indigenous sector and the beef sector in particular is many times higher than it is for people involved in foreign direct investment, for instance, because of the purchase of local inputs and so on.  Farming is critical to our rural economy and our biggest indigenous industry.  The scale of the issues related to Mercosur as they relate to and impact on agriculture are of real concern to the farming community.  There may be benefits for public procurement, services and manufacturing.  In assessing the deal, we will examine all of these issues and the impact on the farming sector, especially the beef sector.  We will consider how we can use the intervening period appropriately to ensure that the ultimate terms and conditions which apply to the deal when it is reflected in a legal text are used to protect and deliver a fair trade agreement and a level playing pitch.<\/p>  <p>  From my constituency experience and engagement with farmers generally, they do not fear competition provided it is fair.  What we fear in the context of Mercosur is the potential for competition to be unfair.  The Government's function and responsibility, during the close-out period of a possible trade agreement, is to ensure its terms and conditions are influenced in our favour.  I reiterate the point I made on carcass weight equivalent.  The segmentation of that insofar as it is currently articulated only deals with fresh or frozen beef.  It is critical in serving our industry to ensure the appropriate segmentation is secured, in particular the imports cannot only be prime cuts and the only segmentation that applies will between fresh and frozen.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the points made about the beef sector in general and its current difficulties.  I refer again to the initiatives being taken in that area.  This trade deal comes on top of other challenges facing the industry, such as the new Common Agricultural Policy and climate change.<\/p><p>One of the great hallmarks of the Irish agrifood industry in all its manifestations, inside and outside the farm gate, is the capacity to work together.  We have met big challenges such as foot and mouth disease and the pork dioxin crisis, and we can rise to meeting this challenge as well.  It is critical that we use the intervening period to influence the shape of the deal that is done.  In everything I will be doing for as long as I am here, I commit to ensuring we deliver fair competition.  In this context, fair competition will ensure we can compete with anybody throughout the world.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Nolan's point about the 260,000 tonnes, in global trade anybody can export provided they meet the terms and conditions of EU consumer protection standards and pay the appropriate tariff for trade with third countries.  Much of the access people enjoy is on the basis that they pay the most favoured nation, MFN, tariff rate.  We cannot stop that product, other than insisting it meets the appropriate terms and conditions.  With regard to the future agreement and the 90,000 tonnes, it is about making sure that whether or not the figure becomes the reality, we ensure the terms and conditions under which the market is accessed deliver fair trade and competition for our industry.<\/p> <p> My colleague has dealt extensively with the approval process.  It is some distance away from us.  I appreciate we will have an opportunity to debate all this tomorrow.  It is some time away and it will be an issue for a future Oireachtas.  It is not an issue this Oireachtas will consider because there is not a deal to be considered at this stage.  I commit to ensuring that if the deal ever becomes a reality it will not have the outline of the deal we have seen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900050#XX01400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562703600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions this evening.  As the Minister, Deputy Creed, said, we want to get the best possible deal for the country and we will work towards that.  The key word is balance and as a Government we need to go through this deal in detail and see whether it strikes the right balance for Ireland.  I recognise and appreciate the very genuine concerns expressed by our farming community about the Mercosur deal but it is also important that we recognise there are positives in the deal for Ireland and significant benefits for Irish exporters in sectors such as business services, chemicals, the drinks industry, machinery, medical devices and the dairy industry, with a reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade for these sectors.  As I said earlier, and I will say it once again, trade deals have been very good for this country.  We are a small open economy and we depend on them.  We exported &euro;316 billion worth of goods and services in the past year, which is a lot of goods and services.  Many products coming out of this country go across the world and it is important we remember this.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be clear that the fact of the matter is that as a Government we absolutely fought to achieve the best possible deal for our farmers in terms of the agreement in principle that we see.  The deal was negotiated at EU level.  As a member state, Ireland raised serious concerns over a long period of time.  We had various meetings and we made all the contacts we could.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, also outlined this.  It is important to say that the agreement as it stands at present ensures there will be equivalent standards.  The EU sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, standards will not be relaxed in any way.  They remain non-negotiable.  The highest EU standards will be applied to all imported goods, particularly food, so there will be no hormone beef and no GMOs will be allowed.  I reassure farmers that equivalent standards will be an integral part of this agreement.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to concerns regarding climate change and deforestation, Mercosur, including Brazil, will have to fully implement the Paris Agreement as part of this deal.  If it does not, the deal will be void and will fall.  It is important to remember this is far from a done deal.  It is an agreement in principle.  It has to go through the legal process and that will take up to two years.  It then has to be voted through by a qualified majority of the Trade Council and then it must go through the European Parliament.  As I explained earlier, as a mixed agreement it will have to come back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and we will be involved in the final ratification process.  I certainly hope this is the case and I will certainly be making the case that it should come back to the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The quota for beef will be phased in over six years, so we are talking about a deal that might not be fully felt until 2028.  Meanwhile, we are staring down the barrel of a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October.  That is 115 days from now.  As everyone in the House is very aware, a no-deal Brexit could deliver a serious shock to our economy.  In particular, it would have very damaging consequences for the agricultural sector.  It is in this context, with serious immediate challenges such as Brexit facing us, that we need to take a step back and use the time available to examine the Mercosur deal in detail.  This is why the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will proceed to ensure a comprehensive independent economic assessment is carried out on Mercosur.  We believe we have the time and space necessary to do this.  I believe the shape Brexit takes and the impact it will have for the agricultural sector will need to be a key consideration of this economic assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has made it very clear that the Government has an open mind on the deal.  As I outlined earlier, there are benefits in certain sectors but there are also negatives.  What we need to do is determine overall whether this will be a win or a loss for our economy.  We should not lose sight of the fact we have had EU trade agreements with Japan, Vietnam, Singapore and Mexico and they have been very positive for our agricultural sector.  In particular, they provide for the export of 105,000 tonnes of European beef.  They were good trade deals for the agricultural sector.  I accept that Mercosur is difficult but what we have to do now as a Government is look at the deal in the round.  That is what the economic assessment will do.  It will ensure that the Government makes a fully informed decision when deciding what position to take when the ratification process on this deal commences in two years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900051#YY00200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1562703600,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers, their hard-working officials, all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and the very engaged Public Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900051#YY00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs: Motion [Private Members]","time":1562704200,"counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900052#ZZ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1562704200,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann: notes that:<blockquote>&mdash;each and every child has a right to education to enable them to live a full life and to realise his or her potential;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;annually, parents of children with special needs and autism face considerable difficulty securing school places for their children;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;there were 3,568 children awaiting a first assessment of need nationally at the end of March;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;there were over 850 children with special educational needs receiving home tuition while awaiting school placement in 2017\/2018;

and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<blockquote>&mdash;immediately use the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 in areas where there is a need to ensure that every child with a special educational need has that need met before September 2019;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;provide additional support mechanisms for parents to directly engage with Special Educational Needs Organisers, and to provide additional resources if required to ensure that parents concerns regarding school places are met;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;provide teachers with access to further undergraduate training in the area of special education needs;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;provide those who are working in the area of special education with further supports for continuous professional development;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;provide additional resources such as the National Educational Psychological Service and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to at-risk children or children in need of assistance to remove the need for a reduced timetable as a response to emotional or behavioural issues;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;introduce legislation governing the use of reduced timetables;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;immediately introduce a mechanism that includes an appeals process to ensure that reduced timetables are monitored, including the reason that a reduced timetable is used, its duration, a plan to support the young person to return to the school timetable and the child&rsquo;s age, gender and ethnicity;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;engage with schools and teachers representatives to address shortfalls in resources to ensure that schools have adequate provision to provide every child with an education; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;create a plan to roll out in-school speech and language therapies nationwide. <\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I am sharing my time.  Every child, including children with special needs, has the right to reach his or her full potential.  I believe that education is key to realising that right.  We must also remember that behind every child looking for a school place is a family, including parents and siblings.  These people often have to fight for everything and not just for school places.  A written response to a parliamentary question posed by Deputy Thomas Byrne last June advised that &quot;enabling children with special educational needs including autism to receive an education ... is a priority for ... [this] Government&quot;.  I really wonder if that is the case.  <\/p><p>I know those are reassuring words because every child has a right to an education.  In fact, this right is enshrined in the Constitution and that is the least that every child, including children with a disability, deserves.  It is a given, or at least it should be.  The reality with this Government, however, paints a somewhat different picture.  A survey conducted by AsIAm found that one third of parents who completed the survey confirmed that they had been waiting more than one year for a school place.  Nationally, more than 850 children with special needs received home tuition last year simply because there were no spaces for them in schools. <\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, school is not just about education.  It is also about the development of social skills and those skills are developed within the walls of the school.  In my county of Cork, 156 children were languishing on a list for placement last year.  That has increased from 121 since 2015.  It is further noted that in circumstances where spaces are provided it is often the case that reduced timetables are introduced as a means of dealing with challenging behaviour.  That is not fair.  Every child should be entitled to a full day in school, except in those rare circumstances where, in agreement with parents, that is not viewed as a good idea.  In most cases, however, children need their full day in school, like other pupils in the class.  The reality is that these numbers are likely to be much higher as the practice appears to go unregulated for the most part.  We have no records and no data are collected.  Imagine that in this day and age we have no way of ascertaining the gravity of this process as it is not monitored. <\/p><p>In fact, many schools make decisions concerning which children are placed on reduced timetables.  Significantly, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, instigated by my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, provides the Minister with powers to compel schools to provide a place within a school to children with special needs.  This power, however, has only been used once so far, in Dublin 15.  This Act needs to be implemented nationally with immediate effect.  I would also like to see more contact between parents and the special education needs officers, SENOs, so that the SENO, the parents and the teachers can be on the same hymn sheet going forward.  What chance does a child have to reach his or her full potential when the most basic of starts, that is, an education, is not being afforded to him or her?  I hope sincerely that we will receive cross-party support for this motion.  I hope that it will allow our forgotten children, often those children who have no voices of their own, to be recognised so that they get what they rightly deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1562704200,"counter":790,"content":"<p>This is an important Private Member's motion being put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It caters for those children and their families who find themselves faced with the most challenges in life.  Every year, I and many of my colleagues find that parents of children with special needs and with autism face considerable difficulties securing school places for their children.  This has led to the establishment of campaigns such as Enough is Enough - Every Voice Counts.  Such campaigns have emerged in the areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick in response to the difficulties experienced by parents in securing school places for their children.<\/p>  <p>  I have certainly found such difficulties in my constituency of Kildare South.  This evening I was reading back over some of the emails I received from parents in recent years and it was absolutely heart-rending and heart-breaking.  Parents are unable to find a school place in their own county, let alone within a local school.  One parent referred to being offered a place 35 miles from home and that meant a round trip of 70 miles.  School is an important setting for socialisation as well as for any academic experience.  The whole principle of schooling locally, where children get to know their neighbours, is very important.<\/p>  <p>   We know that there are close to 4,000 children awaiting assessment to get a school place.  That is a high number of children awaiting such recognition.  I have come across situations where children did not have the requisite diagnosis when their names were on the list for a school.  Their parents were told, however, that it would not be a problem while the diagnosis was awaited.  It then became a problem when the child had the diagnosis, having gone through the whole process of buying uniforms, etc.  More than 850 children with special needs across the country were receiving home tuition last year because a space could not be found for them in schools.  The amount paid for home tuition for these children has increased by almost a quarter in the last two years.  These children and their families are being left behind.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised another situation, with which I am very familiar, with the Minister before.  It concerns 12 children in Newbridge who were leaving an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit within their primary school but who did not have a place to go to at second level.  Some 24 months before those children were due to leave their school we started a campaign and a lobby.  Those 12 children left school in June 2018.  It took until after the November break in that year to get a place within a secondary school.  No home tuition whatsoever was offered during that time.  Those children went for almost half a year without any type of school setting.  That is absolutely wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Through pressure from Fianna F&aacute;il, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 gives the Minister the power to compel schools to provide special classes where sufficient places are not available.  So far, despite concerns raised by parents across the country, this power has only been used once and that was in Dublin 15.  We believe that the Government must be far more active in its application of this power.  The problems do not end when a child enters school.  While Department of Education and Skills does not collect information on reduced timetables, reduced hours or exclusion, evidence from organisations such as AsIAm indicates that many schools have implemented involuntary exclusions or reduced hours for children with special needs.  That is simply not good enough.<\/p><p>The Government must act to ensure that these children receive the education they are entitled to.  It is simply not good enough to ignore the problem.  Schools also must be provided with the resources to vindicate these children&rsquo;s right to an education.<\/p> <p> Going back to the experience in my constituency, quite early on in my mandate I conducted a survey of all the schools in the area, especially homing in on this specific situation.  I was quite shocked by the results of that survey.  It is very important that children of schoolgoing age can get a place in a school close to them or where their siblings attend.  Some 15 years on from the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004, progress has been made with resources and a greater knowledge of what is required in schools for all children, including those on the autism spectrum.  I believe this knowledge is being whittled away year on year without the reduction in class sizes, with yo-yoing entitlement of schools to special needs assistants, and with no increase on ASD classes, when quite obviously the demand far exceeds the supply.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, has spoken about a range of placement options and supports for children that have enrolled as pupils with ASD, but what about the options for children who cannot enrol?  What is their option?  Is it to wait until next year?  Will there be a place then?  How long should a child have to wait until a place becomes available?  From speaking to parents and schools, I have found that quite often they have to wait until another pupil leaves the ASD unit.  Nobody knows, however, when that is going to happen.<\/p> <p> Professor Louise Gallagher, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin, has said: \"We are running to stand still and I would worry that we are over relying on medication rather than being able to give them the full suite of services.\"  Professor Gallagher has pointed out that a diagnosis of autism should be getting a child the required services, but in some cases it is actually shutting a child out of services.  The lack of intervention with any diagnosed condition compounds the situation.<\/p> <p> It is very difficult for parents to face a future for their child that they had not imagined.  Sometimes cases are not presented until it is too late and behaviours can become entrenched.  Interventions are always going to be more difficult, and we all acknowledge the importance of early intervention.  Already parents of children with autism face a journey of having to fight for their children every step of their academic life.  A place in a school in their environment must be a basic requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562704800,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I compliment my colleagues on tabling this Private Members' motion on special education.<\/p>  <p>  Annually, parents of children with special needs and autism face considerable difficulty securing school places for their children.  For those who are lucky enough to secure the place, I will focus on the problems some of those children might face when they enter the school system, normally at the age of four or five.<\/p>  <p>  When they enter school the parents and teachers can notice quite quickly that some children may not reach a particular milestone, or that some children may need extra supports, be withdrawn, might not share and might be happier on their own.  There is no doubt that we have fantastic teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, who are trained to recognise these signs straight away.  Children with ASD can struggle in mainstream, especially those without a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  To the best of my knowledge - I am not sure about DEIS schools - normally most national schools receive funding to carry out two diagnoses per year.  Recently I met the principal of a school for children with special needs.  I believe he gets funding for more than that but he told me that it was like playing God.  One is trying to weigh up the needs of one child against those of another.  One is trying to assess whether the family may be able to go ahead and have it done privately.  The principal said that he feels that he is playing God in this because he is trying to decide which child is worse and needs the assessment sooner than the other child to get the correct supports.  I believe that all Members hear of many of these situations through our constituency offices.<\/p>  <p>  I have received the statistics on children with special educational needs who are seeking an educational placement in a recognised school.  The figures for Waterford are just four for last year, so it is one of the best counties in the country for having children placed.  I do not have many people coming to me to say they cannot get their child into a specific school, but parents do say that when their child is in school and needs the assessment, they are waiting too long for it.  On top of this, some parents try to borrow the money to have a private assessment done.  If there is one thing we could focus on, this would be a very good one.<\/p>  <p>  A school that is located as close as possible to the child with autism is very important.  A child may have to travel by bus and might have a companion on the bus, but in some instances, especially in rural areas, the child might have to travel for one hour to get to the special school with the autism unit and it could be another hour home in the evening.  This puts another two hours onto the day for a four or five year old.  I am aware that we cannot put an autism unit in every national school in the State, but at the same time it is very important to look at geography when we are determining which schools receive these extra supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900053#AAA00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1562704800,"counter":793,"content":"<p>I will be sharing time with Deputy Scanlon.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue of special needs access to school places, and on the issue of reduced timetables.  Every child deserves an appropriate school placement within their community, and this includes children with special needs.  All children are equal.  Some children learn differently and require teachers who understand them.  They require those teachers to have the necessary supports and need more environments that are friendly to their needs.  Children with autism, for example, need sensory friendly environments and sometimes they need visual aids.  These children equally need an appropriate school placement within their community, and this is true integration and true inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, however, parents of children with special needs and autism face considerable difficulties securing school places for their children in mainstream schools or special schools.  Some children over the age of six still have no place, and six of those children are in my county of Wexford.  We are aware of more than 850 children with special needs in the State who received home tuition last year because a space could not be found for them in schools.  Similarly, many schools have implemented involuntary exclusions or reduced timetables for children with special needs.<\/p>  <p>  These children and their families are being left behind.  I have dealt with numerous children and their families through my constituency office in Enniscorthy.  Children are being denied their right to appropriate education, which is discrimination.  There is a real underprovision of places.  Children who have been diagnosed as requiring places in special classes or special schools are being told there are no places available in their area, and some of the children must travel up to 60 km to access a place.  The gap in special needs provision leads to a two tier educational system.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, it appears that the practice of reduced timetables is a growing problem.  The practice appears largely unregulated.  There are no guidelines around its usage and there is no requirement for schools to report on the practice.  Department inspectors do not collect widespread data on it.  This means that children who need intervention cannot get it because the data are not available to identify where they are.  Children end up underperforming, leaving school early and not meeting their potential.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must act to ensure these children receive the education they are entitled to.  Schools must be provided with the resources to vindicate these children's rights to an education.  Schools that are not going to play ball - effectively, those schools that feel they do not have to provide the necessary supports - should have action taken against them.  The Education (Admission to Schools ) Act 2018 gives the Minister for Education and Skills the power to compel schools to provide the necessary spaces for these special children and it should be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900053#AAA00300","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1562704800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I want to raise with the Minister the issue of the rehabilitative training allowance, which I have learned is to be abolished.

I acknowledge the HSE is struggling with a deficit but this is nothing short of scandalous.  Rehabilitative training is essential for young people with disabilities in developing independence, and this payment is much-needed money for one of the most vulnerable groups of people in our society.

I ask the Minister to use his influence, as I did earlier with the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach stated that he was not aware of the abolition of the fund.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices for the sake of people who have no voice.  The fund does great work and provides great help for those who benefit and for their parents.  It is a reason for them to go to work every week.  To do this for a minimum payment of &euro;38 per week is outrageous and I ask the Minister to use his influence to have it reversed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900053#AAA00400","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562705400,"counter":796,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; &oacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il f&aacute;choinne an seans labhairt ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo inniu, go h&aacute;irithe leis An Teachta Thomas Byrne f&aacute;choinne an obair at&aacute; seisean ag d&eacute;anamh ar son na ruda&iacute; speisialta fosta.

T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach an chomhph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht agus an chomhobair at&aacute; le feice&aacute;il sa Teacht seo agus t&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach ar son an &aacute;bhair seo.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing the motion before the House.  It comes here on the back of a great deal of good work that has happened in the House over the seven to eight months since I took up my current position.  I thank the other Members who spoke, in particular the spokespersons, Deputies Funchion and Burton, for their continued vigilance on this issue.  This is a challenging area.  While we may say it is a challenge politically, financially and with respect to resources, it is a particular challenge for the parents of young people with special and unique challenges themselves.  They are very bright, capable young people and autistic children and all their parents are looking for is a level playing field, fair play and the opportunity for them to realise their potential.  I know that is exactly what everyone will articulate tonight.  It is something that has been echoed by those Deputies who have already spoken.<\/p>  <p>  Every time I speak publicly on this issue, we talk about the resources we are applying.  We are putting in almost &euro;2 billion out of an overall budget of &euro;11 billion.  However, while &euro;1 in &euro;5 is going into special education, there continue to be many things we are not getting right.  There is a great deal of work that still needs to be done.  There is a communications issue for parents on the ground as to what schools are available and the way the model is established places the onus on parents to do all the running.  When one is a parent, a great deal is going on in doing the job of parenthood already without having to do extra work when one's neighbour may not have to do the same running.  That is why I want strongly to pursue the school inclusion model.  We have established a pilot scheme and will invest &euro;4.75 million in September to develop a model whereby the HSE will no longer work in parallel to the Department of Education and Skills.  I want to see properly inclusive education in the classrooms.<\/p>  <p>  We will see it in 75 schools in west Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare from September when occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, behavioural therapists, special needs assistants and special education teachers will start to work together to realise the full potential of students with special challenges.  It is a challenge.  We will evaluate the pilot and it will be up to whatever Government is in office at that stage to decide how to extend it and move forward.  Having witnessed the model in practice and seen occupational therapists working together with classroom teachers, it is the way forward.  That is not to say we will not get it right on the first attempt.  I was at Robertson national school in Stranorlar recently and met a mother whose son is in a wheelchair and is attending the school, which has a great and inclusive model.  However, when I started to explain how the pilot would work, she asked about the idea of including a physiotherapist as well.  As such, we have to look at the entire cohort and that may include clinical nurses for complex medical challenges.  That is where we are looking to go but we are not there yet.  The only way we will get there is by working together to figure out a better way.  For example, we are spending &euro;207 million on school transport annually, of which 50%, just over &euro;100 million, is applied to transport for children with special educational needs and one of the speakers earlier asked whether we were getting that right.  There are students travelling one and a half hours to school, which makes for a three-hour round trip every day and we have to look at how to improve the system for them.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative powers have been provided for and we have an Act that has been invoked in Dublin 15.  Having worked with the schools in that area, I am of the view that we will make progress.  For example, there were 88 pupils who were not going to get places last April.  Since then, we have worked closely with stakeholders, parents and the local education and training board and have managed to follow through and ensure we have a special school in place.  A principal has been appointed and the school will be set up in September.  It will be at least a start to identifying the need.  There are 40 other students on the waiting list and we have written to 18 schools in respect of them.  One school has agreed to provide a classroom and we are engaging with two others.  Another school has written to us formally today.  If we can get those three schools over the line, we will meet the needs of 18 students and will be nearly halfway there.  Hopefully, we will have another three schools buying into that opportunity, which is what this is.  The schools I visit, such as Col&aacute;iste Gleann L&iacute; in Tralee, that have special education at the heart of their learning and teaching are richer for it.  Deputies are in and out of schools all the time and will know that.  That message has to get out there.  I am not a believer in the big stick approach to politics whereby we compel schools to build a classroom and give them a date and timeframe by which it must be done.  It is not the way to go because schools will have reasons as to why they are not buying into this model.  Those reasons may relate to continuing professional development for teachers and ensuring teachers have the proper training and support to carry out the job effectively.  We are trying to meet those schools and to figure out the best way to ensure they get the proper supports.  That engagement is ongoing.  As far as Dublin 15 is concerned, the legislation has been invoked but there is a process to follow which is fairly detailed.  The first part of that process is that the National Council for Special Education writes formally to me.  Dublin 15 is the only area in respect of which I have received a formal letter from the council.  I am aware that there are challenges in Cork and Kilkenny too.  There are challenges in all these different areas.  However, we are working on the basis that by September, we will have provided an adequate number of places for the children who are demanding them.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the legislative proposal for reduced timetabling, in respect of which important work with Tusla is ongoing.<\/p><p>It is very important work.  Legislation may or may not be required.  It is too early to tell but I know that is framed in part of the motion as well.<\/p> <p> I am happy to support this motion on the understanding that we continue to make this a proper, all-inclusive conversation.  I will do my best in that regard, through the relevant channels, my office and the officials who work with me in respect of this matter.  There is no magic wand and no template from which we work because Ireland is actually leading the way.  Canada is very much focused on putting special education at the heart of its inclusive education agenda but we are leading the way.  When I was in Finland recently, I saw how it is looking at the Irish model.  However, we must also think all the time about the parents who feel they are the ones who must push for this.  We will do away with the idea of parents having to come up with a clinical diagnosis.  This is behind having the school pilot model and looking at preschool through to primary school in order that we have the information as we go the whole way through.  The Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills has been looking at this matter for some time.<\/p> <p> Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; ar&iacute;s f&aacute; choinne an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.

As he is aware, it is something I consistently raise and it is an area about which I feel strongly and passionately.  I also welcome his honesty and frankness.  It was refreshing to hear the Minister go off script and speak from his own experience about the issue.  This must be matched with actions but I do welcome that and think it is a positive and welcome development.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  I thank Deputies Thomas Byrne and Murphy O'Mahony for bringing it forward.  On 2 April, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and I tabled a Private Members' motion to mark World Autism Awareness Day in which we called for the development of an autism empowerment strategy.  This was unanimously supported.  Key aspects of that motion involved acknowledging the inequity within our education system for autistic children and the fact that we have created a two-tier system that has led to so many children falling through the cracks.  I remind the House, and possibly the Minister, that we are still awaiting the establishment of an all-party committee on autism, as recommended in our motion on 2 April.  This is a matter we will continue to raise.<\/p><p>We support the measures in this motion and feel they must be acted on to tackle the challenges embedded in our education system children with additional needs face.  Without appropriate training, how can teachers enter classrooms confidently and teach all children equally?  Trainee teachers are consistently stating that they do not feel prepared and do not have adequate skills to teach children with additional needs.  This should never be the case.  A recent report based on a National Council for Special Education, NCSE, public consultation highlighted the fact that there is a great deal of concern regarding the level of training and knowledge of teachers who work with students with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, particularly as knowledgeable and experienced teachers are required to work with such children.  There is also great concern about non-experienced teachers being given special classes and resource teaching hours and about the practice, especially at post-primary level, of using resource teaching hours were to fill subject teacher timetables, which is completely unacceptable.  We fully support the recommendation in the NCSE's report to the effect that an ongoing programme of continuing professional development be designed and delivered for principals and deputy principals to allow them to focus on providing leadership in the context of the education of students with special educational needs in schools.<\/p><p>We have spoken about the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.  I understand from where the Minister is coming in that regard.  However, rather than using an approach that punishes schools which do not implement this, although I get frustrated when I see some of the situations that parents and students face and the complete lack of empathy on the part of certain schools, perhaps we should implement a system of rewarding the schools that strive to be good examples, that are out on their own when it comes to this matter and that go above and beyond because this might lead to other schools coming on board if they realise that there could be a benefit from doing so.  It is unfortunate to have to say this but sometimes, that is the reality.  There is a lack of urgency when it comes to establishing the number of ASD classes required to meet demand.  As a result, children are being left at home and left behind.  I raise this issue on a regular basis.  In the past two days, figures emerged in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny which show that many children are awaiting home tuition, which would indicate that there is no ASD class for them.  In the context of social aspects and seeing brothers, sisters and friends going to school, how does a parent explain that to his or her child?  It is neither fair nor right.  I do not care how often I have to say it.  We have created a two-tier system and, as a society, we have nearly accepted the argument that children with additional needs and their parents should be happy to wait and battle for everything and that if they get what they need, even if it is October or November and school has started, that is fair enough and they should be grateful.  We need to change that attitude.<\/p><p>I want to touch briefly on today's announcement that, from September, the rehabilitative training allowance, which is worth &euro;31.80 per week per student, is to be scrapped for new entrants.  This beggars belief and I cannot understand how anybody could stand over this type of move.  The HSE stated:<\/p><blockquote>This decision will bring equity to all persons attending HSE-funded adult day services and will be in line with mainstream vocational training services ... New entrants to training after September 1 will not receive the allowance.  They will not be affected because as they will never have received this allowance.<\/blockquote><p>However, if people know allowance is there, they will factor that in.  It has been proven time and again that there is a cost involved if one has an additional need or disability.  Even if one looks at our public transport system, one can see how people cannot access it if they have additional needs or disabilities.  In such circumstances, it is unbelievable that the HSE could make a comment of this nature.  I ask the Minister to look at this matter.  I know it does not directly fall under his remit but he is a Minister and I ask that he examine this issue and bring the message back so that, one hopes, this decision, which will create financial inequity among school leavers with disabilities and which has been described to him as a slap in the face for school leavers with disabilities who are due to enter training this September, can be reversed.  Adult learning improves health and well-being and equality of access to education is vital for health equality and life outcomes.  Supports for adult learning are an investment, not a cost.<\/p><p>I also want to mention reduced timetables briefly.  I am of the view that everyone, including the Minister, agrees that what is happening in this regard is not acceptable.  Where there are difficulties or struggles, it is not right to almost punish a student by telling him or her that he or she can only come into class from 10 a.m. until noon.  In many instances, children are leaving early or coming in late and straight away they are labelled or people wonder what the issue with them is or why they are always arriving late.  The children then have a fear of going into school and do not want to do so.  This creates so many issues.  There must be a far better way of dealing with that, possibly through working with NEPS and CAMHS to address issues.<\/p><p>As stated, I welcome the Minister's comments.  I am of the view that he has a genuine interest in this matter.  We will support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900055#CCC00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1562706000,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for bringing forward the motion.  I want to take time to mention something that is nearly working in my own constituency.  I am referring to a little boy by the name of Rory Kilduff.  Rory has a place in Gaelscoil Ros Eo.  He is five years of age and is very much looking forward to being able to go to school.  However, he has a condition known as Vacterl syndrome.  I will not go into all the details but it means that he needs a thing called a bowel wash.  It must happen at 6 a.m. and he needs home-care support to get that.  The staff in Gaelscoil Ros Eo have been fantastic so they are ready to take him into school but this is a little boy who will not be able to go to school on time and will miss out and fall behind.  We have talked tonight about how being different marks children out and makes their lives more difficult.  It makes it difficult for them to fit in.<\/p><p>Steps have to be taken to ensure children with additional physical or mental needs can be included and can live their full lives.  To be fair to the HSE, it has been working on this case.  The child in question needs someone to come to his house at 6 a.m. to provide home care support.  I know this does not strictly fall within the Minister's remit.  If this little boy cannot get the intervention he needs, he cannot go to school.  He already has home help.  This is just about changing the time.  Like all the kids on his road, he wants to be able to go to school.  His mother, Shona, has been advocating on his behalf.  I have been advocating on his behalf.  To be fair, the HSE has been advocating on his behalf.  All we want is for this little boy to be able to go to school in September, to join his peers and siblings and to live a full life.<\/p> <p> That is the purpose behind this motion.  Nobody is disagreeing with it.  A child should not lose out on his or her schooling or fall behind in school just because he or she has additional needs.  In this case, we need a small administrative block to be removed to ensure this child can access an education and can live his best life.  I am a mother.  There are mothers and fathers in the Chamber tonight.  We do not want our kids to grow up to be millionaires or whatever else.  We just want our kids to be able to live their best lives.  That is all Shona wants in Rory's case.  I want to help her to achieve that.  I know this is not strictly within the Minister's remit.

I commend the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on its introduction.  Nelson Mandela once said that \"education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world\".  According to the Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, \"The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education\".  A significant number of children in Ireland are not receiving this minimum education.  In some cases, they are receiving no education at all.  These are some of the most vulnerable children in the State.  Many children with special or additional needs remain unassessed and undiagnosed.  They have minimal supports.  In many cases they have no supports at all.<\/p>  <p>  It has been said in this House on many occasions that the education system for children with special needs is broken.  It is not working.  We are failing these children, their families and their educators.  We know very well from research that the earlier an intervention can be made in a child's life through multidisciplinary therapies, the higher the chance that he or she can develop his or her intellect and skills and realise his or her potential on a whole-of-life basis.  I have attended many meetings with parents of children with additional needs who are simply beaten by the system.  They are frustrated and hopeless because they have been unable to secure a supported school place for their children who desperately need such places.  It has been pointed out to me that parents who wilfully prevent their children from going to school are pursued through the courts system, whereas parents in these cases who absolutely wish and hope to have their children educated in an appropriate and supported setting are left to wither.  The State has a direct responsibility for the impact such circumstances have on these children, whose physical, social, emotional and mental development is stunted.  This motion outlines that 3,568 children were awaiting an assessment of need at the end of March 2019.  I received this figure recently in response to a parliamentary question I tabled.  There are no figures available for the second quarter of 2019.  The only legislative guarantee that is enshrined under the Disability Act 2005 is that a child must be provided with an assessment of his or her needs as a result of his or her disability, in addition to a statement of the services he or she requires.  The existence of lengthy waiting lists makes it clear that we cannot get the assessment process right.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment of an additional 100 therapists was announced as part of budget 2019.  At the time, Sinn F&eacute;in criticised this measure on the basis that it did not come close to addressing the crisis we were experiencing.  In our alternative budget, we called for the recruitment of 600 additional therapists across all disciplines to assess, intervene and end the waiting lists and the exclusion of these children from their best chance in life.  I understand from the reply I received to my parliamentary question that just 40 therapists have been recruited.  The recruitment process is still ongoing.  This is simply not good enough.  We are now in the second half of 2019.  The failure to deliver what was promised is contributing to a worsening situation.  Many of the children who are languishing on these waiting lists - they are locked out of education and having their development inhibited because of lack of supports and services - have autism spectrum disorder.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague has mentioned, on April 3 last, Deputy Funchion and I marked World Autism Day on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in by introducing a Private Members' motion calling for the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas committee tasked with developing an autism empowerment strategy.  The Government made it known that night that it did not agree with such an approach.  With support from the campaigning non-governmental sector, the will of the D&aacute;il ensured the motion was passed.  Why, three months later, are we still waiting for the establishment of this committee?  It is most disappointing for me, for the advocacy groups, for the families and, most distressingly, for the children and adults living with autism that this proposition has not been advanced.  It is not good enough.  We have given the Minister and his colleagues a framework on which the lives of autistic children can be transformed.  It takes the politics out of it and gets us all working together for the better good.  I urge the Minister to put his weight behind it and get on with it.  Time is of the essence for these children.  Every day that is lost is crucial time squandered.  I ask the Minister not to let them down again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900056#DDD00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1562706600,"counter":802,"content":"<p>As we come to the end of this D&aacute;il term and this parliamentary year, I am pleased that regardless of how late it is in the evening, the plight, the difficulties, the challenges, the possibilities and the potential of children and adults with special needs are being discussed again in this Chamber, with a specific emphasis on children and adults, particularly young adults, who are affected by autism and are perhaps on the autism spectrum.  Before I make a political point about the economics of this issue, I thank the Minister, Deputy McHugh, for his kind references to Deputy Funchion and me.  We have been raising these issues consistently over recent times.  The point I would like to make at the outset relates to the budget.  The capacity of the Minister for Education and Skills to do the many things the Members of this House are urging him to do ultimately depends on having a sufficient budget to carry out such things.  The Minister's colleague and party leader, the Taoiseach, has said on a number of occasions he would like to see tax cuts in the budget that is coming up in October.  I am not being party political when I say I think tax cuts would make no sense at this time.  The amount that is available for tax cuts is so small that we would not even see the jam or butter being spread on the bread because it would be so thin.  Many of us in the House would support the Minister if he were to decide that the best way to make a great leap forward in addressing the issues of children and families affected by special needs and autism would be to agree collectively that the money which could be used for tax cuts, which could be &euro;500 million, should be used instead to fund services for such children.  That would allow us, as a society, to make the great leap forward on which we all fundamentally agree.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, and especially this year, I have been struck by the massive increase in the population of children in my constituency of Dublin West.  An increasing number of children is a wonderful thing for any country to have.  We are the envy of Europe for this reason.  However, we have an increasing number of children with special needs, as well as an increasing number of children affected by autism, partly because of this population increase.<\/p><p>We have an increasing number of children with special needs, as well as an increasing number affected by autism.  There is nothing as heartbreaking as sitting, as I have at times, with parents of six, seven, eight and nine year olds who have been excluded from school.  Last week, the parents of a six year old contacted me because their precious daughter is basically on a two-hour regime in her school, one of the best in Dublin 15, because the additional facilities, be it an individual special needs assistant, SNA, or some other special facility, are simply not available to the school.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to our teachers, patrons and boards of management.  People involved in the governance and running of schools have been genuinely open.  I am learning more about, for example, people affected by autism and children with special needs.  As a society, 30 years ago we moved from a model of large institutions in which children often ended up and were then institutionalised for their adulthood.  We rightly broke with that particular model for a long time.  That was the right thing to do.<\/p> <p> We have reached another crossroads.  In the Dublin West constituency, hundreds of parents have been at a series of meetings attended by Deputies Jack Chambers and Coppinger, as well as the Taoiseach, and most local councillors.  We have listened to personal presentations by parents whose hearts are often breaking.  Their physical capacity to facilitate their precious children is also almost at a breaking point.  I can think of few things as heart breaking as the parents who told me that their six, seven and eight year olds were either excluded from school - effectively expelled - or whose hours were cut to just a couple of hours a day.  What does it mean to parents who are told that their child will only get two hours?<\/p> <p> I commend the WhatsApp groups that parents have set up, as well as the AsIAm organisation.  These have been tremendously helpful to many Members.  The latter is an organisation of young adults and students who, in many cases, are on the autism spectrum.  Their wisdom, their thoughtfulness and the way they have set out what they have to say about their experience has been a learning experience for everybody.<\/p> <p> Early intervention does make a difference.  During my long time teaching at third level in the DIT, Dublin Institute of Technology, now Technological University Dublin, I encountered many adults who as children were diagnosed as being on the spectrum.  Through resourcing, education and other supports, however, they were able to go on through the education system.  In many cases, their superb intelligence then became available to the rest of us.  I know that this is not everybody affected by special needs.  However, it is some people and it is important that society should be in a position to celebrate, acknowledge and recognise this.<\/p> <p> I am pleased the special school in Dublin 15 will go ahead.  There has been tremendous co-operation from the school which will host this special facility.  We need to look at our language again.  &ldquo;Special classes&rdquo; is the right way to describe a facility which a child may use for a period.  However, that should be alongside an inclusive model where the child is a full participating member of the broader school society.<\/p> <p> I heard about the trek that many parents had to make, some to as many as 14 schools.  I am glad we are putting that behind us.  What does one say to any parent who has to go to 14 different schools, finding the answer in all of them is &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  It is difficult if it is their first child.  For many younger parents, the last time they were in a primary school was when they went to school themselves.<\/p> <p> I welcome the positives and thank Fianna F&aacute;il for raising this issue.  The Labour Party will fully support this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900056#DDD00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562707200,"counter":804,"content":"<p>The Minister made a point in his introduction that provision has been made for up to 15,950 special needs assistants in total for 2019.

Many SNAs at the end of May had their hours cut for next year.  Some SNAs lost their jobs at the end of May.  In some cases, it was to make way for SNAs on lower hour contracts.  One SNA told Cork&rsquo;s <i>Evening Echo<\/i>:<\/p><blockquote>Many jobs were fragmented to .5 or .88 of a day, meaning people losing up to a fifth or more of their income.  On the same day, many newspapers ... said &lsquo;800 new jobs have been created&rsquo; with no mention of the job losses.  It added salt to the wounds of those [almost 300 SNAs] ... who found out that they had lost their jobs via a website.<\/blockquote><p>Another SNA, Frances Linehan, who works as an SNA in a DEIS school in Cork, told the same newspaper:<\/p><blockquote>Special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are coming in and cutting people&rsquo;s hours and this is affecting people&rsquo;s income, as well as the continuity of care for the children in need.

I saw one young child in County Galway put on a panel of 99 children.  It was said clearly that 15 children will be taken care of in a year, but we know that if a child is not seen between the ages of two years old and eight years old, there is less of a possibility of helping that child.  I encourage every parent to ensure they have an assessment of needs form for their child because when parents go looking for assistance, it is often not even filled out.<\/p>  <p>  We need a root-and-branch review of this.  To be fair to teachers, we need to be sure that a large proportion of time in the teacher training colleges is put towards making sure this is addressed.

I have seen parents having to go to the Four Courts to try to get the best for their child and to get some of those services.  It is a sad day when that happens.  Parents want to help their children and every one of us wants to see our children doing well, especially children with autism, and what is happening currently is not the society we should allow to manifest.  We should be there to help those people.  I know and understand there are problems with getting speech and language therapists, but we have to address this problem because of the difference between letting a child live a normal and fulfilled life and not giving him or her the start he or she requires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900058#FFF00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1562707800,"counter":807,"content":"<p>As we enter the school holiday season, for some children with autism, nothing will have changed.  According to the National Council for Special Education's recently published policy advice on autism in 2017, there was and still is a significant body of children with autism within the community who do not go to school at all and will this month see no difference in their usual day-to-day schedule now that school is out for most other children.<\/p><p>I will read into the record a part of the Minister's speech as supplied because it is very interesting and it seems to just be stuck in there.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>In relation to the use of reduced timetables by schools, my Department of Education and Skills has the firm view that all pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend for the full day, unless exempted from doing so in exceptional circumstances.  Reduced timetables should not be used as a behavioural management technique or as a de facto suspension or expulsion, nor does any provision exist for the use of reduced timetables for particular pupils.  Where schools apply a shorter school day in relation to a child, such arrangements should only be put in place in exceptional circumstances in order to assist a pupil to return to school, for example where a pupil has been experiencing an absence due to a medical or mental health related condition.  Any such arrangement should be a transitionary arrangement, which is designed, for example, to assist the reintegration of a pupil to a school environment.  In making such arrangements, school authorities should be mindful of the best interests of the child and of the child's right to a full day in school.<\/blockquote><p>On the next page the Minister goes on to address something completely different.<\/p><p>The Minister is not a bystander in this.  He is the Minister who is responsible and he can make these things happen.  He has to take control of this and that is what has to happen.  It is all right to say these things but the Minister can make it happen and that is vitally important.<\/p><p>While it is unfathomable that there are children in this State who do not have any schooling, there remain persistent reasons behind this statistic.  According to the AsIAm survey, in some instances, these students have simply been failed by the State in terms of inadequate levels of autism or special class provision, despite the obligations on the State under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 to provide an appropriate school place for every child.<\/p><p>The survey also found that in other instances, students have a school place in theory.  They appear on the roll book and, from the point of view of the officials, all is well.  The reality, however, is totally removed from this.  These students may be reduced to a partial school day by the school they attend, despite the fact that this is illegal.  These students may be suspended or expelled, not for negative behaviour in the traditional sense, but literally because they are autistic and go unsupported in school.  They may irregularly or almost never attend school due to overarching anxiety or a lack of suitably trained teachers, but they continue to be enrolled as normal.  There were more than 850 children with special educational needs receiving home tuition while awaiting a school placement in the 2017-2018 school year, and while these children are receiving an education, they are still excluded from the community and isolated from other children their own age.  If those children were asked whether they would prefer to learn at home or with other children, they would undoubtedly say they would want to attend school.<\/p><p>I commend the incredible survey work carried out by AsIAm, which provides much of the basis on which this motion and our contributions work, as it is the most comprehensive policy document on the issue of autism and special needs education to date.  There is no single action or solution that will address this crisis, and that is the difficulty the Minister has.  The Department of Education and Skills has clearly failed to adapt the school system appropriately to be autism friendly and has allowed for there to be a lack of regulation around how schools treat autistic students and their families.<\/p><p>I echo AsIAm and other organisations which have been calling for reform and ask the Government to address adequately and comprehensively the range of outstanding issues such as the need for more autism classes, improved infrastructure, better teacher training and an obligation placed on schools to be fully inclusive.  On the subject of an increased number of autism classes, I am sure everyone here feels like its Groundhog Day as we have been calling for increased classes for many years and still there is a chronic underinvestment in this area.  We also need reform in the way statutory services, such as Tusla and the HSE, deliver for children with special needs.  These services have failed in their respective roles to provide the support to prevent students falling out of school or to help them to return.  Over 91% of parents surveyed by AsIAm said that their child or children were experiencing exclusion or extended absence from school while not receiving any support from Tusla.<\/p><p>Most important, and something which this motion attempts to address, is the issue of waiting lists for children to get their first assessment of needs, with in excess of 3,568 children waiting nationally at the end of March.  It has been said that the assessment of needs system is in disarray, with flagrant disregard for the statutory time limits.  Proposals to bring in a new operating procedure involving a 90-minute assessment have rightly been met with criticism by therapists, parents and unions.<\/p><p>Better teacher training is needed to ensure that teachers are adequately trained to deal with children and autism related issues.  It has been brought to my attention that there may be issues relating to the interview process that schools use, where it has become political in some jurisdictions, depending on who is on the board of management etc.  That is failing our children as well and it needs to be addressed.  I have been notified that some SNAs have had difficulty getting an interview at all, despite having a degree, adequate experience and everything else.  This is always possible with the management structures within our schools.  Some teachers may need additional supports to carry out further training, and this should be provided by the Department as well.<\/p><p>I end by echoing the sentiment by Inclusion Ireland that 13 years after the Disability Act 2005 was brought into law, it is time to admit that it has been a failure and it is time to admit that the Government has failed the children of this State by not defending their right to education.<\/p><p>They have a right to an assessment of need, not the right to wait on endless waiting lists.  They have a right to an early intervention, which is imperative if children are to enjoy positive outcomes and if we are to see children with learning disabilities and special needs start life on a level playing field with children everywhere else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900058#FFF00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562708400,"counter":809,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion tonight.  It is far too common for issues with special needs education to arise.  The assertion from the Proclamation read by our forefathers to cherish all the children of the nation equally is definitely not carried through today.  Education is just another aspect that brings unnecessary difficulty in the lives of special needs children and their parents.  More than 3,567 children were waiting for assessment of need at the end of March this year.  The immense pressure that is left on parents to find adequate education for their children is an added stress for them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must engage with schools and teachers to address the shortfalls in resources on many fronts.  I am on the board of management of my local national school.  In particular, there is an extreme shortage of SNAs for our Irish teaching schools and this must be addressed to protect our Irish language and give those with physical disabilities a chance to learn the language.<\/p>  <p>  Integration between children and children with special needs has major benefits in the learning and understanding of every child.  Disengagement of special needs children has a catastrophic effect on them and where they have a place in school, it tends to be on a reduced timetable.  This simply is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Carrying on from that, the Government needs to revise the general capitation grant.  The grants cover the day-to-day running costs like heating, lighting, insurance, general upkeep and the purchase of teaching materials.  It is totally insufficient to cover the current cost of schooling and forces schools to go out with buckets collecting money on the side of the street.  This is not what schools' boards of management should be doing, but they have no choice.  The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, has demanded that the Government fully restore the primary school capitation grant to the 2010-2011 level of &euro;200 per pupil.  The minimal increase of the capitation grant by &euro;9 in last year's budget does not go far enough.  The INTO general secretary, John Boyle, said the increase was already spent due to rising insurance and energy costs, and is only a plaster on the wound.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue in primary school education is the pressure that is put on teaching principals who cannot cope with both the duties of a teacher, with homework and all the paperwork that goes with teaching, as well as the paperwork in the role of a school principal.  The Government needs to look into this urgently as the workload becomes too great.  This is again an issue that disproportionately affects rural schools with a small student population and only a handful of teachers in the school as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I support Fianna F&aacute;il's motion calling on the Government to ensure that every child with a special education need has that need met before September of this year, so we can truly live up to the Proclamation and cherish all the children of the nation equally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900059#GGG00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1562708400,"counter":810,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this important motion and I compliment its authors.

T&aacute; an tAire imithe.  The Minister is gone now.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group highlighted these and similar matters during the debate on our own motion on this issue.  I also sought to highlight some of the broader challenges in the provision of SNAs.  The lack of job security and an exhaustive application process are among some of the obstacles preventing the full participation of special needs assistants in schools.  SNAs are still being treated by the Department as optional extras instead of being seen as vital members of the school teaching staff.  The Minister for Education and Skills has left to be replaced by the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, and we know how he looks after his personnel, so we do not have much hope in that area.<\/p>  <p>  Despite all the rhetoric around the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increasing the number of SNAs, it has done practically nothing in facilitating the SNA as a permanent member of staff.  They should be an integral part of the school.  It is because of this that schools, and in particular, principals and boards of management are telling us that they have to spend a significant amount of time making applications each year for SNA support for their schools.  The primary principals are struggling with their workload when they are teaching principals.  That is why I again call on the Government to provide job security to SNAs by providing permanent employment contracts.<\/p>  <p>  I am also calling on it to review the SNA supplementary assignment panel arrangements, as substitute work should be taken into consideration to enable all SNAs to gain entry onto the panel.  It is absurd that an SNA&rsquo;s service in a substitute capacity, covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job sharing, etc., does not count towards obtaining the required one year&rsquo;s service that allows an SNA to become a member of the supplementary panel.  That is shameful, downright wrong and a blackguarding of the people.  That must change.<\/p>  <p>  At present parents are operating in a vacuum with regard to obtaining certainty around the assignment of an SNA for their child.  That kind of stress is totally unacceptable.  The children with special needs need these supports and the SNAs must be supported.

Early assessment of needs is vital.  Many families cannot afford to pay for this themselves, are on the public waiting list and have to wait too long.  The longer the children are without assistance, their needs increase, especially for autistic children.  The July provision is very helpful for autistic children when they are off school.  It allows them to develop social skills.  Routine is very important for these children.  It provides an opportunity for respite for the parents.  I hope the Minister of State or someone is listening to me because it is very important.  Children with Down's syndrome are being excluded from the July provision, for which they should qualify.  It is important for the Government to seek to redress this very sad deficit because these children need assistance and would benefit greatly from the July provision.<\/p>  <p>  Another area of concern for many parents and students is where schools apply to the State Examination Commission for reasonable accommodation for students sitting their junior certificate or leaving certificate examinations and who need a scribe or a reader.  Why is the Department cutting back on these reasonable accommodations?  The schools are finding it very difficult to get these reasonable accommodations, especially for children with dyslexia or dyspraxia who are suffering because of the Government cutbacks.  I am asking the Minister of State to do something about this.  It is good to have the opportunity this evening to ask him for this.<\/p>  <p>  There is another idea that is being used in Kerry.  The South Kerry Partnership has developed a very important model for children and people who have a deficit and are not fully physically or mentally well.  They can benefit from social farming.  Children and teenagers are taken out to a farm by farmers who are committed to this and get a few bob for it.<\/p><p>It is very good for children and many of them would benefit from nature, seeing what happens when a sheep has a lamb or a cow having a calf, and all that happens on a farm.

I was a bit alarmed to think that rules or regulations for the boards of management of single sex schools precluded them from applying for ASD units.  I was very comforted that the response said they were not.  It is important for any parent with children with autism or varying needs, listening to this debate to realise that their schools are not precluded.  That is set out in the Minister's response to me which stated:<\/p><blockquote>Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes. It is open to any school to make application to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to establish a special class.<\/blockquote><p>The following week I asked for a breakdown of where those schools are located in order to build a database of the geographical spread of these schools.  There are 131 early intervention schools, 743 primary schools and 322 post-primary schools.  Many parents, particularly in my constituency of east Galway, have to travel up to 20 and 25 miles to access the fantastic ASD unit in Carrowbane.  It is disappointing that children are displaced from their communities, friends and families.  It is a hardship for parents to have to travel such a distance.  It is very important that we look at the geographical spread.  In Athenry there are two fantastic secondary schools being built.  An ASD unit is going into one of them.  We should be doing that in every large town where we are developing schools to ensure that when children with ASD and autism make friends they are not discommoded when they go to post-primary and have to try to build up those links again.  Parents, teachers and support workers have worked very hard to ensure that there is that level of social engagement.  It is disappointing if the school in that parish or community is not available to them that they have to travel.<\/p><p>It is very difficult to get the bus link or route established for people who do not meet the definition of the nearest school.  Those are some of the challenges that we face.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan, has responsibility for this.  Last year St. Jarlath's school in Tuam presented a challenge.  It has been fixed but it took several weeks for children coming from a particular area to get the school run working.<\/p><p>In his opening statement the Minister talked about the preschool sector and how important it was to have that and early intervention.  We do not need a diagnosis.  We are gathering the information.  Since the inclusion of the access and inclusion model, AIM, we know how many children are attending preschool and that there is an uptake of 99.8% in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, model.  We know what is being flagged through the preschool officer and the public health nurse and what the children need when they get to national school.  That is why it is a bit amazing to think that of the 3,305 national schools only 743 are making the classes available.  There is a lot of work to be done there.  While I welcome the announcement of the 156 additional classes, I am very conscious that we are not even a quarter of the way to accommodating the needs in everybody's community.  I compliment my colleagues on tabling this motion.  There will be much comfort for parents to think that this is being debated in the D&aacute;il and that their voices are being heard and we are trying to work to ensure their children are supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900060#HHH00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1562709000,"counter":814,"content":"<p>We should salute the teachers, the SNAs and parents who do incredible work for children with special needs.

I know several parents of children with special needs very well.  The day starts for many of those families at 6 a.m., getting the child or children ready.  It is a difficult process, we all know that.  They have to get that child onto a bus.  I know of one case where the child spends a certain number of days at home and two or three days in care.  The transport is provided from the home but not from the centre to the school.  That type of thing should not be happening.  It is deeply frustrating and upsetting to parents of children with special needs.  Schools cannot put special classes in place for those children if they do not get the finance.  I know of parents who drive 18 or 20 miles to a school to ensure that their child with special needs is facilitated.  We need more units and to try to keep children in their own communities.<\/p>  <p>  Some parents recently had to go to court about July provision.  While they did not win their case, the court made it quite clear that special provisions were to be put in place to assist the parents of Down's syndrome children.

Parents say they slip back a long way if they do not have that type of provision.

We need to do much more and recognise that the matter must be dealt with.

Where pupils require more targeted intervention, special class or special school placements are also provided.<\/p>  <p>  Significant levels of financial provision are made each year to ensure that all children with special educational needs can access education.  The Department of Education and Skills spends approximately &euro;1.9 billion, or almost 19% of its total educational budget annually, on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.  The main supports the funding provides for are more than 13,400 special education teachers in mainstream schools providing additional teaching support for pupils with special needs, more than 15,000 special needs assistants supporting care needs, 125 special schools and more than 1,450 special classes in mainstream schools, an assistive technology scheme to provide assistive technology supports and equipment, and special school transport arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Teacher training and continuing professional development, CPD, in the area of special education are also an important component of ensuring that children with special educational needs can be supported in schools, as has been reflected in the motion.  There have been substantial developments in recent years, both in initial teacher education, ITE, and in CPD for serving teachers, to support teachers&rsquo; knowledge and understanding of the specific needs of children with special educational needs.  In fairness to Deputy Rabbitte, she highlighted that while there have been significant developments over the years, we need to go further, as other Deputies have also noted.  Inclusive education, including the education of children with special educational needs, is already a mandatory part of the standards for ITE.  The Teaching Council&rsquo;s accreditation process for ITE programmes is the mechanism through which the council can satisfy itself that its standards are being met through a given ITE programme.<\/p>  <p>  A range of additional training and supporting educational provisions are also provided to schools by the support services of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  The remit of the NCSE is to develop schools' capacity to support students with special educational needs and to promote a continuum of educational provision that is inclusive and responsive.  The NCSE support services provide additional professional development supports for teachers who teach children with special educational needs.  In this way, the NCSE fulfils a vital role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the area of special needs provision.  CPD and other in-school supports provided by the NCSE are designed to enable teachers to adopt evidence based approaches to teaching students in special and mainstream classes and special schools.  The focus of professional development is on enhancing teachers&rsquo; understanding of the nature of the special educational need and the learning and teaching implications for each individual student and teacher; enhancing teachers&rsquo; use of a variety of interventions and teaching approaches for students based on the assessed needs of students and taking account of empirical research; and enabling teachers to assess, plan and implement effective and differentiated teaching strategies with a view to meeting the needs of students through individualised planning.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child experiences challenges that affect his or her education, schools may also seek support from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  NEPS works with schools through the DEIS continuum of support framework.  The NEPS model of service works through a problem-solving and solution orientated consultative approach to support schools to meet the needs of individual pupils.  NEPS sanctioned psychologist numbers have grown from a base of 173 whole-time equivalent posts in 2016 to 194 posts at present, of which 186 psychologists are in place.  This represents the highest number of psychologists employed in NEPS since the service's inception in 2000.  The Government remains firmly committed to the maintenance of a robust and effective educational psychological service.  As part of budget 2019, the Minister announced the provision of an additional ten psychologist posts to NEPS from next September, bringing the overall number to 204 posts.  Recruitment for 2019 and 2020 is under way to fill both existing vacancies and provide for new posts to realise the target of 204 posts.  <\/p>  <p>  The motion calls on the Government to engage with schools and teachers' representatives to ensure that schools have adequate provision to provide every child with an education.  Section 20 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 provides that one of the functions of the NCSE is to advise the Minister for Education and Skills on matters relating to the education of children and others with disabilities and to consult voluntary bodies and stakeholders in doing so.  Under A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Minister for Education and Skills also committed to consulting stakeholders.  The NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers in recent years that have made recommendations aimed at developing a better educational services for children with special educational needs.  Policy advice reports include the NCSE policy advice on supporting students with special educational needs in schools, published in 2013; the report of the working group on a proposed new model for allocating teaching resources for pupils with special educational needs, published in 2014; and the comprehensive review of the special needs assistant scheme, published in 2018.  In developing such policy advice papers, the NCSE consulted widely with stakeholders, disability representative bodies and parent bodies.  In bringing forward proposals for the implementation of the recommendations contained in these reports, the Department of Education and Skills also consults widely with education partners and stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Following consultations with education partners, a new model for allocating special education teachers to mainstream schools was introduced from September 2017.  Under the new allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education teaching support based on the school&rsquo;s profile.  Schools are front-loaded with resources to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This means children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.  It also means that under the new allocation model, children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.  It gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, irrespective of their diagnosis.  As recommended by policy advice, the new allocation model moved from a diagnostic based allocation process to a needs based process, whereby schools will allocate resources from a set profiled allocation based on the individual needs of pupils.  The Department will also consult education partners in respect of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the comprehensive review of the special needs assistant scheme.<\/p>  <p>  To further support schools, schools will also receive a 5% increase in capitation from September 2019.  Over the course of the school year 2019-2020, an additional &euro;10 million will be allocated to primary and post-primary schools, of which &euro;4 million will be allocated in 2019.  This increase is the beginning of the process for the restoration of capitation, which is one of the actions included in the Action Plan for Education 2019.<\/p><p> Tonight&rsquo;s motion also called on the Government to create a plan to roll out speech and language therapies in schools nationwide.  Speech and language therapy services are currently provided for children who require this service by the Health Service Executive.  However, a demonstration project to provide in-school and preschool therapy services has also been taking place over the course of the 2018 and 2019 school year.  The project has been developed by the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs and Health, along with the Health Service Executive, and it is being managed and co-ordinated by the National Council for Special Education.  The purpose of the project is to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports by providing speech and language and occupational therapy within educational settings.  This innovative pilot will complement existing HSE-funded provision of essential therapy services.<\/p> <p> I thank everybody for their contributions and for raising these matters.  It has provided an opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring children with special educational needs are provided with every opportunity to fully participate in and benefit from the education system.  I confirm the Government will not be opposing this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562710200,"counter":818,"content":"<p>When we speak about special educational needs, we know early intervention is critical to the success of any work done with young children.  Due to the appalling waiting times that parents experience for a crucial assessment of needs, pupils tend to fall behind, feel excluded and, in some cases, be confined to reduced timetables.  It appears the use of reduced timetables is a growing problem, although this practice appears to vary across the country.  Some principal teachers opt to impose a reduced timetable as a response to a child's challenging behaviour when there is a lack of available learning supports for the student and others must use it as a disciplinary method.  We know this happens throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  A survey conducted by AsIAm indicates that half of parents of children with autism have been waiting for more than a year for a suitable school place and that hundreds of children are being excluded from school altogether.  This online survey, which received 300 responses, indicates that a third of parents have been waiting one or two years for a school place, with one in ten waiting between two and three years and 7% of parents waiting for more than three years for a suitable place.  The practice of reduced timetables appears to be largely unregulated and there are no guidelines.  There is no requirement for schools to report on the practice and the Department's inspectors do not collect widespread data on it.  This means the real scale of the use of reduced timetables is unknown.  In some cases, parents have withdrawn their children from a school in the absence of appropriate supports.  Some children are on partial school days and have even been advised to seek home tuition instead.  Others have been suspended or expelled from school.  We all know of such cases in our constituencies.  These children are invisible, and for the most part, as they do not show up on official statistics, they are being left out of the education system.  Children end up underperforming, leaving school early and not coming close to reaching their potential.  They are, effectively, left behind.  Teachers end up teaching pupils of different academic status with no cohesion whatever.<\/p>  <p>  The fact there are no data available on the practice of reduced timetables is particularly worrying.  Nobody is monitoring the issue and therefore there are no targeted resources or interventions.  I listened attentively to the Minister of State talking about the HSE's intervention in the critical assessment of need.  He mentioned speech and language and occupational therapy, as well as physiotherapy.  We meet parents in our offices and clinics on a daily basis who are exasperated and frustrated about this.  In some cases they are in trouble with the school authorities.  The school may not be able to cope because of a lack of support and the parents get into trouble because children do not meet the designated number of days on which they must attend school.  It comes down to the important assessment of need and not having the required interventions in place.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with much of what the Minister of State said towards the end of his contribution when he argued the HSE is rolling out sufficient schemes to provide speech and language therapy.  That is not my experience on the ground and my feelings are probably echoed by a number of my colleagues across the House.  These children are not getting the interventions and they are being left behind.  Parents are struggling to either get these children to school or keep them there because these crucial supports are missing.  We speak about autism and learning difficulties but needs are not being met.<\/p>  <p>  This is an opportunity to commend the work of special needs assistants, SNAs, throughout the country.  They work tirelessly and are completely committed to the very special work they do.  They are poorly treated in terms of job security and permanent contracts; they do not have these and can only aspire to getting them.  It is very difficult for them and they suggest they are undervalued and do not have sufficient job security.  There is a problem because qualified SNAs cannot get contracts or jobs despite feeling very passionate about the work they do.  Those people are worth their weight in gold in communities as not everybody can do the job.  Those who go for that training deserve the support and recognition in the form of proper contracts for a very specialised job in the education system.<\/p>  <p>  I highlight the work of the Holy Family school at Cootehill, County Cavan, which is an exemplary model of a school dealing with special education.  It has had to do its work against a backdrop of very poor resourcing until now.  It is fortunate as it will get a new school building but it is an exemplary model of special education delivery that anywhere in the country could look to.  Bailieborough community school is another secondary school that has provided an autism spectrum disorder unit relatively recently and at least it allows those students to feel part of the mainstream community comprising their friends and siblings.  I ask that the Government try to replicate that model of special education across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900062#KKK00200","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1562710200,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for his work on the motion and all the Deputies who contributed to this very important debate tonight.  As the Minister, Deputy McHugh, said earlier, special needs education has expanded much in recent years, which is to be welcomed.  Despite that growth, there are still very significant hurdles to be overcome.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the work of the Committee on Education and Skills in recent months has centred on barriers to children receiving a full education, including socio-economic grounds, minority backgrounds and the particular challenges of special needs education.  There is certainly wide political agreement that these barriers should be removed and every child must have their rights vindicated.  This motion, which Fianna F&aacute;il was pleased to bring forward tonight, aims to ensure that the Minister for Education and Skills would have a more hands-on approach over the coming months in the run-up to September.  I acknowledge that the Minister has met teachers and written to schools in Dublin 15 but the matter of special needs school places has not been tackled as the national issue it is swiftly becoming.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the comments from the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, in his response about recognising that the inappropriate use of reduced timetables by schools has an adverse effect on a child's education.  It is for this reason that the development of guidelines and a mechanism for monitoring the use of reduced timetables are now being fast-tracked by the Department.  It is welcome and was one of the recommendations made by the committee last week in a report we sent to the Minister.  We absolutely appreciate that he has taken on board what the committee has recommended in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The powers under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act should not be seen as a last resort to be deployed in the weeks before the school term begins, as the Minister, Deputy McHugh, said.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes those powers should be used when it has become clear there is upcoming demand that would not be met by schools without intervention.  This would allow schools the time required to place the full suite of measures in place that are needed by children.  In the case of children with special needs, the requirements can be complex and putting them in place within a limited deadline would add extra complication to the process.<\/p><p>The Minister must be willing to step in when the problem starts, not when it has got to the point where it can no longer be ignored, as was the case in Dublin 15.<\/p> <p> Every year, Deputies of all parties and none spend the month of September addressing the issues which inevitably arise as parents strive to ensure their children receive an education.  Some of this could be avoided by working in the coming months to address the problems before they arise and I hope the Minister adopts this approach.<\/p> <p> There is one remaining aspect of the motion I want to address and that is the development of the plan to see in-school speech and language therapies delivered nationwide.  Far too often, we focus on maintaining what we have rather than being ambitious for the future.  I welcome the pilot project that the Minister has announced as a response to our motion relating to the provision of speech and language therapies which will have numerous advantages in our schools and I look forward to that being rolled out and seeing the response for it.<\/p> <p> I am going to give the last word to a mother, Ms Elaine Sears, who contacted me some time ago about her child, Daragh, who could not get a place in a primary school.  She said that Daragh is a very capable and happy boy who loves learning and being around other children and having him in school is very important for his communication and developing social skills.  He has autism.  He is different, not less, and he deserves to have an education that is not going to be a daily struggle for him and his family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900062#KKK00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562710800,"counter":821,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562710800,"counter":822,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.50 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 July 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
