Workers across the country will be deeply alarmed and angered by the Government's latest plan for the State pension.  Let us call this what it is: a Trojan horse designed by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to move the pension age to 70 by stealth.  The cat is out of the bag.  The Government wants people to work until the age of 70.  I suppose this will not come as a surprise to anybody because, after all, these are the parties that were hell-bent on raising the pension age to 67 and then to 68 until the weight of enormous public pressure made them climb down.  However, instead of doing the right thing and bringing forward a progressive and fair policy, the Government is now presenting a ploy to force people into working until they are 70 years old with the promise of then having a decent standard of living.  \"Retire at 70 for an extra &euro;60 in ... pension\" is how one newspaper summarised it.  This, however, is a scam.  The pension deferral the Government is proposing means, in reality, that thousands of euro in pension payments will be taken from workers, payments they would now have as of right.  We must be clear on this point.<\/p>  <p>  It is not only those approaching pension age who are angered by this plan, but also young workers looking on now and wondering if they will ever get the chance to retire at all.  Workers should have the right to retire at 65 with their pension, if that is what they want to do.  The Government's proposal completely ignores the everyday reality of those who do hard physical jobs that take a toll on the body.  Many of these workers started working at the age of 16 or 17, and some did so at a younger age.  I am talking about factory workers, carers, retail workers, those on their feet all day in the service industries, nurses and many, many more.  Hundreds and thousands of workers will be left out in the cold under this plan.  They are not incapacitated and do not need an invalidity payment; they simply do not have anything left in the tank to keep working beyond the age of 65.  They have put in their shift, they have done their bit and they are exhausted.  Their right to retire at the age of 65 on a fair pension is not only a matter of public policy, but also a matter of principle and basic decency.  One is either for it or against it.  Clearly, the Taoiseach's Government is not only against it, but it will move heaven and earth to ensure it does not happen.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is for the right to retire at 65 with a decent pension.  This is what we would deliver in government.  By the way, if we were delivering the budget next week, we would back up this commitment with an increase in the State pension of &euro;15.  T&aacute; plean ag an Taoiseach chun aois an phinsin a bhogadh go dt&iacute; 70 bliain d'aois.

It is the duty of any Government worthy of the name to provide a State pension that allows pensioners to live a good and secure life.  People looking on today will be very worried.  I have a straight question for the Taoiseach and I would like a straight answer.

Yesterday the president of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, Dr. Fergal Hickey, said that this winter was likely to be \"hell on earth\" for patients as well as staff and that we face what could be an Armageddon-type situation.  We know there have been 40,000 breaches of waiting times this year.  That is 40,000 patients waiting more than 24 hours.  Last Wednesday there were 596 patients, including 20 children, without a bed.  Dr. Hickey went on to say that emergency departments have become warehouses for admitted patients and that this is a 365-days-a-year problem.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, described the situation as an entirely predictable surge and called for a laser focus on recruitment and retention.<\/p>  <p>  Staff vacancies arguably pose the greatest threat to our health service.  There are almost 900 consultant vacancies and no sense of urgency from the Taoiseach's Government on agreeing a new consultant contract.  Our non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, are leaving Ireland in their droves due to the serious issue of excessive working hours, with doctors not even getting paid for that overtime and many reporting burnout, lack of career progression and bullying.<\/p>  <p>  Nursing is equally under pressure to retain staff.  Faced with the pressures on our health services, the cost of living and the prohibitive cost of housing, it is no wonder so many go away to work abroad in health services that actually function properly and provide care for patients who need it.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, and importantly, our acute bed capacity is 2.8 per 1,000 population, while the OECD average is 4.3.  Ireland has the lowest number of hospital beds in the EU.  Over 300 of the beds which were to be delivered by the end of last year have yet to materialise.<\/p>  <p>  Incredibly, yesterday's meeting of the emergency department task force was the first since January.<\/p> <p>How will the Taoiseach prevent what is likely to be an Armageddon in our emergency departments when Covid and the flu put even more pressure on our emergency departments this winter?

I have long articulated my admiration for all those who worked on the front line during the various stages of Covid.  We saw on our television screens the enormous challenges and pressures that Covid put on our health system.  Our health system proved itself resilient in the face of an unprecedented pandemic.  Over the past number of years since the start of the pandemic, we have dramatically increased the level of funding to our public health service and increased capacity significantly.  Approximately 900 acute beds and about 340 community beds have been provided.  The number of ICU beds has gone up from approximately 255 to about 306, which is a significant increase.<\/p>  <p>  It will be a very challenging winter.  We have watched what has happened in the aftermath of Covid in places like Australia and New Zealand.  We did not have the flu for the past two years, essentially, as Covid was dominant.  There is now a real prospect of the widespread spreading of flu and Covid-19 during the winter period.  Therefore, vaccination is the first line of defence in terms of people's lives and their health.  I urge people to get vaccinated, particularly those who are recommended, with both the Covid booster dose and the flu vaccine.  I think the flu vaccine campaign will commence in early October.<\/p>  <p>  We have also increased home support hours with about 20.5 million hours delivered in 2021.  That was 2.9 million more hours than in 2020, a 17% increase, and there is a higher target for this year.  There are issues in terms of home care teams with them having expanded so quickly and in such a significant way.  That created a strain and pressure on home care teams.<\/p>  <p>  There will be a winter plan, for which funding will be announced in tandem with the budget.  The HSE task force is meeting on a daily basis to prepare for winter.  It will be a challenging winter.<\/p>  <p>  I point out that overall staffing numbers have increased by 15,000 in the past two years.  That is the largest ever increase on record since the HSE was established.  That figure includes 4,500 nurses and midwives, 2,300 health and social care professionals, and 1,400 doctors and dentists.  The health service is recruiting at a level it has never recruited at before.  That does not mean that there still are not challenges in the recruitment of key professionals.  There are but everything will be done to make sure we support the health service in the coming winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000006#D00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I am not sure what &quot;everything will be done&quot; means.

The winter preparedness plan has adopted a bottom-up approach.  It has gone to every hospital group and local plans have been sought.  Sanction has being given to hire emergency consultants if the groups so wish.  In the plans that have come from the various hospital groups, flexibility will be applied in sanctioning the teams they want to hire.  As the Deputy knows, we are implementing measures to help with the flow by avoiding people gong to emergency departments and providing GPs greater access to diagnostic tests.  This has been significant in a range of areas.  We have developed community integration teams and integrated care teams for older people.  Enhanced community care has been very effectively rolled out.  All of this prevents people from going into emergency departments in the first place.  The other key issue is the flow of patients through hospitals and subsequent discharge.  This is key to keeping the emergency departments freer to take people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000007#E00800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680300,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Last week, I spoke with the mother of a long Covid suffer who until she contracted the virus was a young and fit woman working as a doctor in a busy hospital.  She has not stood on a hospital ward in more than 11 months because she is still recovering from the illness.  Based on research conducted in Ireland and the Netherlands, 336,451 adults are experiencing or have experienced a long-lasting impact of this illness, known as long Covid.  Long Covid encompasses a broad range of illnesses following Covid infection and is based on three clusters of symptoms.  These are fatigue, respiratory issues and cognitive problems.  They can range in severity from those who cannot recall the PIN for their bank card to people who are unable to get out of bed.  The vast majority of these people did not require hospitalisation at the time of the original infection, with many experiencing only mild symptoms.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has recognised the need to support these patients and last September, it finalised an interim model of care for long Covid to provide a national approach for the provision of services and supports, yet up to last month only 20 of the 60 health service staff to be recruited to these regional centres for the management of prolonged conditions associated with Covid-19 were in post.  We are told that until these regional centres are fully operational, we will not see the establishment of GP referral pathways.  Even now there are still no plans to provide a dedicated service for children with long Covid.  The eight planned regional clinics will primarily focus on fatigue and respiratory-related issues with a single consultant neurologist appointed to deal with cognitive problems.  This is despite evidence presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health indicating that cognitive and neurological problems are emerging as the most significant long-term issues for those with long Covid.<\/p>  <p>  The only clinic supporting those with long Covid neurological issues, which is at the Mater Hospital, is set to close its doors at the end of next week because of the failure by the HSE to fund it.  I firmly believe the failure by the HSE to put in place a comprehensive strategy for those with long Covid is contributing to the record figures we witnessed last month with almost 10,000 patients on trolleys in our hospitals.  Unless the interim model of care is revised to reflect the emerging evidence on long Covid and such a strategy for all of our patients, regardless of age and illness, is then delivered, this will compound a dire prognosis for our health service this winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000007#E00900","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising a very important issue that is affecting quite a number of people.  I have tremendous sympathy for those suffering from long Covid.  It is one of the reasons that during the height of Covid, when we had the lockdown, I was insistent on taking strong measures.  It was not just about mortality.  This was a deadly disease.  When a person got Covid, it could lead to long Covid and affect a person's health and quality of life for quite a long time afterwards.  People were saying we could get by, but this was a disease we had to try avoid people getting, at least, until vaccination arrived.  Vaccination has prevented the disease from impacting more severely on people than was the case prior to people becoming vaccinated.  Vaccination was the game changer.<\/p>  <p>  That said, there is an interim model of care, as the Deputy described, to provide long Covid services nationally.  We want to see a more uniform framework.  Considerable research is going on.  In the nature of medical research, we will need more research, not just on identifying the features or, indeed, the duration of long Covid and the length of time it will impact on a person.  Presumably, the research will also have to look at the model of care.  If someone develops cardiac or respiratory issues and there is a long Covid centre in a hospital, ideally, the specialists in the centre of excellence for respiratory issues should then perhaps have to deal with the person's issues.  It will at some stage need an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to some of the issues that manifest themselves as a result of long Covid.  I will follow up on the matter.  The Deputy is correct on the cognitive and neurological implications of long Covid.  I do not believe they are disputed.  We will follow up on that.<\/p>  <p>  There are long Covid clinics in St. Vincent's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, University Hospital Galway and, I think, in Cork University Hospital.  There are post-acute Covid clinics in Galway and in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.  Tallaght University and St. James' hospitals are operating a combined post-acute and long Covid clinic.  There is a tertiary neurocognitive clinic in St. James' Hospital, led by a consultant neurologist with a background in neurocognitive disorders, which is accepting referrals from long Covid clinics throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  We are happy to work with the Oireachtas and the Joint Committee on Health on this.  I do not dispute the issues he is raising.  They are very serious issues.  In the forthcoming health budget, we wish to see whether we can increase the level of resources available, specifically, in a ring-fenced way, for long Covid.  Approximately &euro;2.2 million has been allocated so far.  An epidemiological survey is being planned that would provide insight into the prevalence of long Covid in the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000008#F00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>With regard to the prevalence of long Covid, based on my analysis of the social welfare payments for Covid-related illnesses lasting 12 weeks or more following the initial infection, 21,000 people are unable to go to work due to long Covid.  This figure does not take into account the tens of thousands who are suffering with less severe forms of long Covid who are going to work but not contributing to the same extent that they did prior to the illness, nor does it take into account the thousands of people who recovered from the initial infection but had a subsequent relapse.  Not only is this having a significant impact on our labour force but, as an Australian long Covid study put it, even low rates of Covid-related permanent illness or disability could still lead to significant future burden of disease.

I will break it down into three simple examples and explain to him how his Government is crippling businesses in the country, putting our householders into poverty and going to drive the country into a recession.<\/p>  <p>  The first example is one I gave him last year but I will give it again.  The tax the Government takes on fuel, which is &euro;57 of every &euro;100, is based on tax once you break down all the different charges.  At that time, I and the Rural Independents asked the Taoiseach to cap the price on which the Government would tax fuel.  We understand the Government needs tax to run the country but it is taking tax at an inflated rate and getting in more earnings.<\/p>  <p>  The second example is the cost of electricity.  We saw recently that for the first six months of the year the ESB made a profit of &euro;390 million.  Over 12 months that will be &euro;780 million.  Under the laws that are there, the Government will automatically take 12% of that, which equates to approximately &euro;93.6 million.  The Government will take 12% in tax as it does from any company that makes a profit.  The Government reduced the VAT on electricity to 9% but its intake is still up 30% on this time last year.  I will break this down to simple brass tacks for the Taoiseach.  Last year, a householder who used 1,341 units at a price of 13.2 cent per unit had a bill of &euro;244.03.  The same person today for the same usage will pay a bill, including VAT, of &euro;457.83.  The Government's 9% VAT take on that bill alone is up 30% on this time last year, so the Government loves inflation.  Everyone else in this country is on the poverty line trying to survive.  A business that had a &euro;600,000 electricity bill last year is now faced with a &euro;2.7 million charge this year.  It employs 100 people and has told me it is not viable.  Every business in the country is under pressure to put food on the table and keep the employment they have and our Government's VAT take on energy is up 30%.  The Government is the only business in this country that is up 30%.  Everyone else is down 30% as they try to keep people at work and have children go to school and college.  What does the Government do?  It has 30% more than it had this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000009#G00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680900,"counter":60,"content":"<p>First, the Government is not a business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000009#G00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680900,"counter":61,"content":"<p>You can chalk that down again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000009#G00500","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680900,"counter":62,"content":"<p>That is an important point.

Once files have been screened, any cases where there may be a potential for a clinical concern will be examined by Dr. Maskey.

While the event took place alongside a NATO summit, it was a separate event and not a part of the summit.  The discussion covered current political and security challenges in Europe, not least the need for a strong common response to Russia's illegal and immoral war against Ukraine.  There was remarkable consensus that the issues at stake include not only Ukraine's right to freedom and sovereignty, but also our shared democratic values and the vitally important rules-based international order on which they depend.<\/p>  <p>  Ahead of the meeting, I had the opportunity to meet bilaterally with the Austrian Chancellor, Karl Nehammer.  Our discussions covered a range of issues including how we, as fellow neutral EU member states, can best contribute to efforts to support Ukraine and to ensure Russia's aggression does not prevail.  At the event itself, I spoke to many fellow leaders, including Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&oslash;re and Icelandic Prime Minister Katr&iacute;n Jakobsd&ouml;ttir, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.  I also met with President Joe Biden; the President of the European Council, Charles Michel; and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez.  <\/p>  <p>  In my contribution, I made the important point that while Ireland is militarily neutral, we are not, and have never been, politically neutral and we have made a significant contribution to the EU's resolute response to the war.  I pointed to our unwavering commitment to international peace and security, including through our role on the United Nations Security Council.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has major implications for Ireland and the world, especially concerning energy, food and migration.  It is important at this time that Ireland shows solidarity with like-minded democracies and advocates a rules-based international order.  In this context, Ireland should continue to commit to the evolving Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, of the EU.  As the Taoiseach is aware, we have been an active participant in civilian and military CSDP missions and operations, and I take it we are open to the idea of the proposed mission to provide military training to Ukrainian personnel.  It is clear that participation in CSDP does not alter our defence policy of military neutrality.  For a start, this would be incompatible with our commitment to the 2017 UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

At a time when millions of ordinary Europeans face the threat of being frozen in their homes this winter or struggling to put food on the table, it is outrageous that NATO is committing to spend billions on a new nuclear arms race.  The Taoiseach attended the EuroAtlantic summit dinner that took place immediately after the NATO summit.  It was held in the same city and had a huge overlap in participation.

When I asked about it last week, the Taoiseach told me that he was \"not aware of the specific meeting in question,\" and that he \"does not believe ... [I am] correct ... [in my] analysis that ... [they] are using the war in Ukraine to drive the militarisation of the world or NATO.\"  I want to ask again as this is important.

I reiterate that the US Secretary of Defense has described this as \"our NATO alliance.\"  It was also mentioned that there were nearly 50 countries present for this fifth meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.

It was interesting that after the immoral invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which was an unprovoked and savage attack on the people of Ukraine with missiles hitting civilian targets and killing innocent people, including children, Finland and Sweden, which had a different position prior to this war, decided to join NATO.  It was their decision.  They are closer to Russia than we are and felt vulnerable.  Around that time, I visited Finland.  I had my visit organised before their decision.  Both the Prime Minister and the President of Finland were in a position to articulate to me the entire sea change that this invasion caused, in terms of the national psyche of Finland in the first instance.  They said that everything they were told as children in terms of fearing a potential invasion of Russia had transpired in terms of the invasion of Ukraine, so much so that public opinion had changed dramatically in favour of joining the military alliance that is NATO.  The same happened in Sweden.  That is the impact so far in terms of how those countries feel threatened and vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  The same applies, by the way, to the European Continent in terms of what could happen in the future and the degree to which the EU on its own, or at least certain countries within the EU, would be in a position to repel significantly attacks of this kind.  Hence, the countries on the east see this as an existential threat because of their history.  Countries like Estonia are clear that this is existential to them.  When I speak to the Prime Minister of Estonia, she points out that the only time of freedom her parents got was that time between the First World War and the Second World War.  She speaks about Stalin, who was brutal in terms of what he did to Estonia, Poland and other countries, and Hitler.  These people's life experiences are far different from ours.  Sometimes we should be less arrogant in the House in proclaiming what they should and should not do.  If we had lived through what their parents and grandparents lived through, we would have a different perspective in terms of the potential of Russia to violate their territorial integrity and their nationhood, as has happened in Ukraine.  I hope I have answered Deputy Durkan's questions in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Haughey that the broader aspects of this war bring in energy and migration.  It is a terrible tragedy that migration has become a weapon of war of cynical countries, such as Russia and Belarus.  The latter encouraged people to fly in from the Middle East, and indeed flew some of them in, and then brought them to the borders and left them in over the borders pretending to them that it was Germany.  That is what is going on.  I have no doubt that Putin knew what he was doing by bombing entire cities so that the people would flee Ukraine into Europe.  We have had the biggest humanitarian disaster since the Second World War in terms of up to 7 million more displaced, with the vast majority having to flee into Europe.  On the food issue, there has been an improvement made in terms of the opening up of the Black Sea but there are real concerns, between a combination of climate change and the war, in terms of future hunger in the world.<\/p>  <p>  With the evolution of the Common Security and Defence Policy, it is the best place for Ireland to be in right now.  That is my view.  It has evolved.  We have contributed to peace missions in that context and to interoperability training missions, etc., which make sense, particularly when we are in serving with the UN in Lebanon.  We work with Polish troops and work with other countries which are members of the EU, and it makes sense that the same equipment is used and that there is interoperability.  That is how our policies have evolved.  We are not a member of NATO.  That is clear to NATO.  It is clear to us.  We are not politically neutral but we are militarily neutral.<\/p>  <p>  On the possibility of a citizens' assembly, hopefully the existing ones will come to a conclusion shortly.  I would like to think that sometime next year, we could commence a citizens' assembly in relation to the broader issue of neutrality and defence, etc., because we have issues around cybersecurity and broader issues in terms of our vulnerability at sea.  In terms of all of the data that goes under our seabeds, we must be mindful of the economic presence in Ireland.  We also must be mindful of how vulnerable are we in terms of radar.  That is why the Commission on the Defence Forces has articulated the need for a significant increase in defence spending to protect ourselves as a country.  We would have the lowest level of military expenditure across Europe and I smile at times when the Deputies opposite talk about militarisation.  The one thing Ireland has not done in the past 20 years, 30 years or 40 years is to militarise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000018#Q00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663686000,"counter":248,"content":"<p>How much is the Government increasing the military budget by?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000018#Q00300","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1663686000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I said that over the past 40 years we have not militarised as a country.

Participants in the Crimea Platform remain committed to Ukraine's sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters.  We reiterated our resolve to maintain pressure on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol without delay and to restore Ukraine's control over its sovereign territory.

We tabled a motion in the D&aacute;il to that effect, pointing out that, annually, 12% of all Ukrainian state budgetary income is currently going on debt repayments and that that was utterly unsustainable.  At the start of the war the IMF said that Ukraine's economy could contract by as much as 35% in 2022 but that the debt would remain sustainable if there were a fast end to it.  Unfortunately, and tragically, there has been no such fast end to the war, and the result is a deeper crisis for Ukraine.  The consequence, in the absence of a full debt cancellation programme, is that Ukraine has been forced to apply for a new special IMF loan programme, which will come, as we understand from our own experience, with onerous restrictions, if the country is even able to get it.  Is it not past time, therefore, for cancellation of Ukraine's debt?  Let us look at who the debt is owed to.  The biggest creditor is the IMF, which was due to be paid more than &euro;2.5 billion in 2022.  Then there is a series of private creditors, hedge funds, including the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity International, Amia Capital and Gemsstock Limited, all holding Ukraine's foreign debt.  Is that not a real act of solidarity that could be made with the Ukrainian people to lift this unsustainable and odious burden?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000019#R01100","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1663686600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan raised the first question.  What was interesting about the three towns just outside Kyiv that I visited was that none was a military town and, therefore, there was no militarism there.  There was no need to undertake the atrocities carried out by Russian forces on the people of those towns.  I went to the town of Bucha and to the church there.  I met with the priest and the people there.  They had a photographic exhibition of young men, hands tied behind their backs who were murdered.  It was quite horrific, graphic and shocking.  If a young man was caught with a mobile phone in his hand, the Russian forces might suggest that he was ringing somebody in the Ukrainian army.  He would be taken out and killed; summarily executed.  In Irpin, likewise, there were just residential blocks bombed.  There was no military context whatsoever.<\/p> <p>In many of the cases, citizen defence committees were trying to hold things together.  The economic prospects of these towns is very bleak.  Much of our meeting focused on reconstruction and how the EU can help as it is committed to that.  Other countries are helping out Ukraine.  There are the issues of immediate supports and then reconstruction.<\/p> <p> We have given assistance in a variety of ways.  We have given direct humanitarian funding to Ukraine.  We have provided funding to the Red Cross.  In the context of international war crimes, we have allocated an extra &euro;3 million to the International Criminal Court, which Deputy Haughey and others raised, to improve its capacity.  There must be careful gathering of evidence of war crimes by the courts and the International Criminal Court has the expertise to do that.  That needs to be followed through on.  Deputy Richmond raised a similar issue and asked whether we are doing enough.  We are in my view.  The Ukrainian Government asked EU member states to help specific regions, almost in a twinning relationship, to recover and reconstruct basic services, such as schools and hospitals and so forth.  The Government is examining that proposal, as well as providing supports more broadly with our European colleagues.<\/p> <p> On the financial issue raised by Deputy Paul Murphy and others, EU leaders agreed to support Ukraine via exceptional macro financial assistance of up to &euro;9 billion in 2022.  Disbursement of the first &euro;1 billion was agreed before the summer break.  EU finance ministers recently agreed to accelerate the next tranche of &euro;5 billion, which is in addition to the &euro;1.2 billion emergency loan provided to Ukraine earlier this year.<\/p> <p> The EU will be the key player in the reconstruction of Ukraine.  Along with international partners, we will work with our EU colleagues.  Through our Presidency of the Council of Europe, Ireland has worked with the other 45 member states of the council on an action plan to assist rebuilding work in Ukraine.  We made a &euro;1 million contribution to a specially established Ukraine donor fund in the Council of Europe Development Bank.<\/p> <p> On the liquidity questions, it is not as simple as saying that the debt should just be cancelled.  There are various mechanisms, via the IMF, World Bank and so on, whereby Ukraine is being facilitated.  Its economy has collapsed by approximately 50% so efforts have been made, in the allocation of European funding to Ukraine, that they will be able to pay the basic wages of citizens.<\/p> <p> One of the biggest challenges facing Ukraine is that many of its workers are on the front line fighting and many millions have left Ukraine.  This in itself is having an impact on the country and, therefore, President Zelenskyy is anxious that people will come back to Ukraine to provide childcare and various services.<\/p> <p> We will do everything we can to pursue the war crimes issue.  I pay tribute to Ms Justice Siofra O'Leary, on her elevation to the position of President of the European Court of Human Rights, which is significant and fantastic achievement for an Irish woman.  I had the privilege of meeting her on my recent visit to Strasbourg.  It is tremendous news indeed.<\/p> <p> Looking at what has happened in recent weeks, two nuclear plants have been threatened by Russia.  A bomb fell within 300 ft of a plant.  This is deadly and dangerous stuff in Ukraine with nuclear plants being put at risk as a result of Russian aggression, bombs and so forth.  A reservoir dam was also destroyed in retaliation.<\/p> <p> I think I have covered most questions.  We will continue to work with the Ukrainian Government to do whatever we can to support Ukraine, in particular its application to the EU, reconstruction and in respect of its interaction with the IMF, EU and World Bank.  All member states have a role on those bodies in terms of guarantees we give.  One cannot say, \"Let's cancel this.\"  That would have repercussions across the system.  There are structured ways to deal with this and help Ukraine financially, which people in all organisations have been responsive to at all levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000019#R01200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","time":1663687200,"counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00200"},{"type":"question","time":1663687200,"counter":278,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[43922\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1663687200,"counter":279,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[44366\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing last met.","asker":"1550","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1663687200,"counter":280,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[44841\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing will next meet.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1663687200,"counter":281,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[44917\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing will meet next.","asker":"1501","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1663687200,"counter":282,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[45726\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing last met.","asker":"1698","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1663687200,"counter":283,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[45764\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing will next meet.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663687200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 14, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on housing has met six times to date in 2022.  The last meeting took place on Thursday, 15 September, with the next meeting planned for Monday, 10 October.  The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of Housing for All and the delivery of programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters.  Housing for All is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State and contains a range of actions and measures to ensure more than 300,000 new homes will be built by 2030, along with delivering fundamental reform of our housing system.<\/p>  <p>  The 2030 target includes 90,000 social, 36,000 affordable purchase, and 18,000 cost-rental homes.  The plan is backed by the highest ever State investment in housing.  The progress of Housing for All is overseen by the Cabinet committee on housing and government, with progress reports published quarterly.  On 14 July, the Government published the fourth quarterly report, Q2 2022 progress report.  It shows significant progress and sets the course to significantly increase the supply of housing and provide a sustainable housing system into the future.  Of the 213 actions in Housing for All, a total of 156 have either been completed or are being delivered on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  While the war in Ukraine and consequent cost pressures have placed great pressure on the sector, there are strong signs of momentum in housing delivery.  Between April and June of this year, planning permission was granted for 11,374 new homes, which is a rise on the same period in 2021.  Building started on more than 7,000 new homes during this period and 7,654 new homes were completed, an increase of more than 50% on the number of homes completed in the same period of 2021.  We are confident that the target for delivery of 24,600 homes in 2022 will be met.<\/p>  <p>  Under the plan, we have introduced four significant affordable purchase initiatives: the first home scheme; the local authority purchase scheme; the local authority home loan scheme; and Project Tosaigh.  These measures have been implemented to increase supply and make homes more affordable.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund has also been established to address current viability challenges and activate housing supply at density in city centres through the delivery of 5,000 homes for owner occupiers.  In tackling vacancy issues, we have launched a number of measures, including the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages scheme and a new town centre first policy, as well as changes to the fair deal scheme to remove disincentives to renting or selling vacant property.<\/p>  <p>  Employment in the construction sector is now greater than pre-pandemic levels, and apprenticeship registrations are increasing significantly.  International recruitment initiatives are under way while there is an entire work stream on modern methods of construction.  Far-reaching reforms, including to our planning laws and our land management and activation mechanisms, are well under way.  The actions outlined in the plan are backed by in excess of &euro;4 billion in annual guaranteed State investment in housing over the coming years.  <\/p>  <p>  When Housing for All was published, it included provision to review and update the plan on an annual basis to react to any changes or emerging challenges.  This review is under way and it does not seek to change the policy direction, but affords us the opportunity to react to the many challenges that have emerged since the plan was published, most notably, the ongoing inflationary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  The review is focused on measures to activate and accelerate supply, and a final version of the update will go to Government in October.  The Cabinet committee will continue to focus on delivery of the Housing for All plan and any other housing-related priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000020#S00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663687200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Will the Cabinet committee on housing discuss home income thresholds for social housing supports, which have not changed since 2011?

The report states: \"The Working Group estimates that of apartments and duplexes (or associated common areas) constructed between 1991 and 2013, the number that may be affected by one or more defects, i.e. fire safety-, structural safety- or water ingress defects, is likely to range between 50% and 80%, which equates to between 62,500 and 100,000 apartments\/duplexes.\"  It means if people live in a Celtic tiger-built apartment block or duplex the chances are that there are serious defects in the construction of the home and they will be faced with a substantial bill.

He could instruct local authorities to purchase every property where there is an eviction on the ground of sale.

The State is the biggest player now in house building.  We need to build far more houses than we are currently as a country.  No doubt Covid 19 hit construction with the two lockdowns.  The increase now in commodities and prices has been quite significant, at well over 20% on some materials in the building industry.  There has been one big storm after another facing the construction industry and the Government's plans.  Notwithstanding this, we feel that we will make the target of 24,600 this year.

This Bill presents welcome amendments to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act 2020.  I and my party will support the Bill.  These amendments will address barriers which prevent holders of British medical degrees from taking up interim training posts in this State.  This is essential for attracting more internationally-trained doctors into the HSE and for increasing and deepening all-island co-operation in training medical professionals.<\/p>  <p>  However, we are currently experiencing a shortage of interim posts despite the increase in recent years from 727 in 2016 to 854 intern posts this year.  While all-hours graduates are entitled to one, many international students who want to stay and work in Ireland cannot get one and we also need to increase the number of medical graduates in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also makes other registration-related amendments required to ensure the continued provision of a route to registration on the general division of the Medical Council's register for certain cohorts of internationally-trained doctors.  These amendments are vital to ensure that internationally-trained doctors can continue to register and practice in this State.  Many issues of unfairness are also faced by international doctors in assessing medical specialist training posts which this will not resolve.  That is an issue of capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also ensure that social care workers who must register with CORU are subject to the same relevant standards as other regulated health and social care professions.  This Bill, while welcome, speaks to a weakness in Government policy when it comes to the medical profession.  For a number of years, the HSE has been overreliant on international recruitment to fill posts.  The Medical Council's medical workforce report 2021 published over the summer illustrates this significant reliance, with more than twice as many international graduates as Irish graduates first registering with the Medical Council in 2021.  Likewise, we have a significant overreliance on international recruitment to fill nursing posts.  In 2021, 62% of first-time registrants with the nursing and midwifery board were non-EU workers.  Migrant workers contribute vitally to the Irish health service and are the only reason that staffing levels have not collapsed.  However, we must develop a sustainable supply of domestic graduates and retain those we train.  The problem we face is illustrated in the fact that by the end of May, Australia alone has already issued 402 visas to Irish doctors, compared to 272 in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Not only must we train more Irish doctors and make it easier for internationally-trained doctors to come to work here, but we need to stem the bleed of Irish graduates abroad.  It is a disgrace that again, we are seeing considerable numbers of doctors and nurses leave, not because they want to - many do want to go to develop skills and some will come back and some will not - but, unfortunately, my experience of dealing with some junior doctors and people who would want to come to work in the Irish healthcare system are opting to emigrate out of necessity and because they feel that the public system is not delivering for them in the way that they would like.<\/p>  <p>  To address all of that will take serious work, to address working conditions as well as the housing disaster and the cost-of-living crisis which is driving talented graduates from our shores.  The ongoing dispute with non-consultant hospital doctors is not growing confidence in the ability of this Government to deliver on health.  Speaking at the medical professionalism conference 2022, the CEO of the Medical Council, Leo Kearns, stated that the council's 2021 medical workforce intelligence report, \"will definitely highlight the need for a workforce strategy for healthcare\".<\/p>  <p>  I have been talking about this for some time.  We need a comprehensive workforce strategy that gets real about training more graduates and about retaining and recruiting more and dealing with the myriad industrial relations issues, contract issues, capacity issues in the system which make it difficult for medical professionals to work on the frontline in healthcare and, of course, the cost-of-living and the housing crisis do not make it any easier.<\/p>  <p>  I will also discuss a matter which this Bill does not address; the regulation of homecare workers.  This is important from a safeguarding point of view, as well as for employment standards and pay.  There is a dire need for greater regulation across the homecare sector, which has been highlighted by HIQA time and again.  The non-regulation of homecare as a profession does a disservice to care workers in my view, as it means the State does not truly value the work that they do as a professional career.  It is also a disservice to those in receipt of homecare and their families who should have confidence that the care worker delivering their care is a fully-regulated professional.<\/p>  <p>  Homecare workers are, more often than not, caring for people who are at a higher risk of abuse or neglect.  Anyone who is working so closely with people in a vulnerable position should be a regulated professional.  This lack of recognition for homecare is at the root of the shortage of homecare workers.  There are many different reasons, but I think we will all accept that working conditions and pay in this sector are among the main reasons we cannot recruit the numbers that we need to fill the million of hours that are made available every year under the Estimates process.<\/p>  <p>  It is not recognised, unfortunately, as a valuable, meaningful career by the State, which is evidenced in the HSE's outsourcing of homecare to private providers.  They are not given the secure, well-paid employment which they deserve and their employment conditions often leave them with little or no pension, unreliable hours and insecure employment.<\/p>  <p>  I welcomed, a number of years ago, as I imagine most Deputies in the House did, the considerable number of additional home-help hours that were made available in the budget a number of years ago.  Unfortunately, many of those hours were not delivered, simply because we could not recruit the staff.  I also know that we have the same problem with children's disability networks teams.  We have the same problem in many different areas of healthcare.  On paper, people are entitled to a service.  We are being told the funding and the money are there but we cannot get the staff.<\/p>  <p>  There was a big announcement in the budget again last year and big numbers from the Minister.  The Government said it would recruit 10,000 staff.  Five and a half thousand were recruited but it is way behind what we should have recruited.  Critically, they are in those areas of primary care and community care which are very important for staffing and the network teams which are supposed to working on the ground to provide for people in the community, care for people in the community to take pressures off our acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  It really is about time that we got serious about workforce planning and healthcare.  It really is about time that we looked at fully implement the safe staffing and skills mix framework.  It is about time we deal with all of the contractual issues which have bogged down recruitment and retention in the health service for so long.<\/p> <p>It is about time we treated healthcare professionals and people who work in the public or private sector delivering healthcare better.  One clear example I can give, which I raised directly with the Taoiseach earlier, is the pandemic bonus payment, PUP.  It affects people under the Minister of State's brief given she has responsibility for older people.  I listened intently to Tadhg Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland this week.  He quite rightly challenged the Government on the failure of the HSE to deliver the pandemic bonus to all the staff in nursing homes.  We talk about Covid and the huge pressures staff were under, which was absolutely the case in acute hospitals, but nursing homes bore the brunt in the first couple of months.  It was traumatic for people working in nursing homes.  It was beyond belief what they had to go through to ensure people were kept safe.  Despite this, they are the very workers who still have not got the pandemic bonus payment.  Bizarrely, and in a failure of governance on the part of the Government, we hear now that the State is going to employ a consultancy firm to find out or figure out how to pay non-HSE staff.  Some consultancy firm is going to be hired and it will be paid well, as these firms are.  I do not know how long this will take but it is beyond a joke that this is where we are at nine months after this bonus was first announced.  Members of the Defence Forces, fire service workers, cleaners, security staff and, as I said, people who work in nursing homes and agency staff still have not been paid.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> This Bill does a number of good things, which I welcome.  We must properly regulate the healthcare sector.  Regulation in staffing is important and professionalising healthcare is something we should always strive to do.  The removal of barriers, as provided for in the Bill, is welcome but the bigger challenge is convincing the people who are training to come and work in the public system.  This Government has much to do if it is to win over graduates to come and work in the public system.  That is deeply unfortunate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000022#U02800","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663689000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>This is a welcome Bill despite its technical nature.  It addresses a number of registration-related issues affecting certain registrants with the Medical Council and CORU.  The Bill makes a small number of amendments to the Medical Council's complaints investigation process and to liability in civil proceedings for specified persons.  It makes a number of amendments to support the performance by the Medical Council of its triage, investigation and adjudication of complaints functions under the 2007 Act.  It also seeks to ensure social care workers applying for registration with CORU are required to meet the same safe standards as all other CORU professions.  In addition, it provides that the Minister may vary the qualifications to be listed in Schedule 3 to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will remove roadblocks to people who hold a British medical degree from availing of medical intern posts in this State and ensure a route to registration on the general division for international doctors.  These are small but important steps that will help us attract more doctors from abroad.  However, it is no replacement for addressing the fact that Irish doctors have been emigrating in their droves over the past few years.  The Government must speak to newly-qualified doctors and ask them why.  I accept some choose to travel but in my experience the vast majority are leaving this State because of our health system.  They are leaving because of the housing situation, their inability to buy or even rent an affordable home and the spiralling cost of living in a country where people are choosing between food and fuel.  This is a country where people are waiting until they have two or three medical issues to see a GP because of the cost.  That is not to mention the difficulty of getting an appointment to see a GP.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is a missed opportunity because it does not provide for regulation of the home care sector.  This sector is in desperate need of professional regulation.  The Minister of State should not take my word for this.  HIQA has called for regulation of home care services and so too have unions and workers in the sector.  It is vital we have adequate regulation in home care to prevent unregulated workers intimately caring for vulnerable people.<\/p>  <p>  Other issues such as low pay, non-recognition of the vital service that home care and home support workers provide and the HSE's overreliance on private home care providers must also be dealt with.  The HSE spends &euro;20 million a year on home care support.  It should be directly employing these carers and ensuring they have good pay, good conditions, pensions and a clear career path.<\/p>  <p>  In the past few weeks, I met the National Community Care Network and Family Carers Ireland.  They are both saying we have a recruitment crisis, as are service users.  The Government is doing very little to address the matter.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will work towards a sectoral industrial relations solution for pay and conditions to provide a basis floor with standards that will attract or retain the workers in this sector.  We will make home care an attractive career opportunity and provide training.  We will add home care sector workers to the critical skills list for employment visas and permits and prioritise direct public sector service provision in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 35,000 home care hours per week are not being delivered, with more than 4,500 people who have been granted funding on waiting lists for carers.  We need to make this sector an attractive career.  We need to move away from nursing home care to care in the home.  Recently, I met Alone and last week I met Age Action Ireland.  Everyone favours our older people ageing in place, that is, in their homes and communities.  Older people deserve better and Sinn F&eacute;in in government will ensure that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has sat in on many a meeting with me around our older persons' advocacy groups and everything else.  She is well aware of how difficult it is for these people to attend to people who are in that sort of need.

We also welcome the removal of the bureaucratic anomalies that prohibit people who hold British medical degrees from availing of medical intern posts and establishing a route to registration for the non-consultant doctors on the general division of international doctors.  However, I encourage the Minister of State to address the outflow of our own qualified doctors who are, worryingly, emigrating in large numbers.  For example, by May of this year, Australia had issued 402 work visas to qualified Irish doctors.<\/p>  <p>  In my region, 25% of GPs are destined to retire within the next five years.  We have five locums in place and these circumstances are replicated throughout most other regions.  Many urban doctors are not able to take on the numbers of patients presenting, many of whom are elderly people who are left without access to family doctors for weeks due to the retirement of neighbouring GPs.  Many rural areas are left without any doctors at all.  I ask that immediate action be taken by the Minister on this alarming public health issue before it becomes a national emergency.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the title of \"social care worker\" will become legally protected on 30 November 2025.  It is only right and fitting this should happen.  As we know, social care work involves work with the most vulnerable people in our society, from people with disabilities and the homeless to women in prisons and their children and those living in poverty.  I am glad these workers will finally be recognised as a cohesive professional partner with their fellow social workers.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill should also provide professional regulation of the home care sector.  This part of the sector is fundamentally connected and in many cases overlaps with the work carried out by the social workers and care social workers of Ireland.  Some 35,000 home care hours are not being delivered.  At the start of the year, 600 families were waiting for home supports in County Wexford.  I ask the Minister to establish a national database on respite availability that would give a comprehensive practical view on the age, details and specific requirements of each region.  The key public aim of the registration of medical, health and social care professionals is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration structures and processes.  Professional regulators are important and part of the reason we have such a high and well-regarded standard of healthcare professionals in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the level of professionalism experienced in care provided by our healthcare professionals is outstanding and we saw this in particular during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is for this reason that the pandemic employment bonus is so bitterly disappointing.  Nine months on, workers are still waiting on their well-deserved reward.  The complete lack of a controlled and planned roll-out of the bonus by the Minister and Government is unacceptable.  Will the Minister of State outline a definite timeline setting out when all front-line workers will be paid?<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill and sees it as a vital part of protecting the public interest, especially in the sphere of social work and care workers having to meet the same safety standards as all other CORU-registered professionals.<\/p> <p>We welcome the new route this Bill provides for registration of international doctors and plead with the Minister to accept the importance of the points raised on the emigration of our doctors and the significant numbers of our family doctors who will be retiring in the not-too-distant future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000023#V00300","speaker":"1621","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663689600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for being here today and recognise the seriousness of this legislation.  Although it is quite prescriptive, it is very finite.  There is a lot in it but it will make a significant difference collectively across other work the Government is doing in the area of health.  It will address a lot of issues around trying to get foreign medical professionals involved in our health service.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State or any other Deputy in the House about the challenges facing the healthcare service.  We have a swiftly growing population as is indicated by the results of the most recent census.  There is significant pressure being placed on the health service, with significant growing pains.  It is important that we do absolutely everything we can to ensure we have an efficient healthcare service, including trying to get people from a multitude of different countries to come here and work.  Many other developed countries of the same standing as Ireland from an economic point of view have been doing so for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  There is one area I would like to highlight and in which I would like to see a little bit of work being done.  I have encountered a number of people who came to Ireland to become pharmacists from countries such as South Africa.  I understand that a significant portion of them are still encountering difficulties.  They were told there were delays as a consequence of Covid and they are still waiting for further information.  I believe it is under the remit of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  Perhaps that is something the Minister of State could check with the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the Minister in their respective capacities.  It needs to be looked at.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree it is remarkably unfair that people who have been here for three and four years are not able to work in the capacity in which they came here.  In the cases to which I am referring the people came here as pharmaceutical technicians.  I am very familiar with the pharmacy sector in general as I have two siblings who work in that profession.  I am kept well briefed on the issues pertaining to it.  I look forward to meeting the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, next week at its budget briefing.  Those provisions are very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  The other point we need to get serious about, and Mr. Watt as Secretary General of the Department of Health is better placed to do this than anyone else, since he did it for himself, is pay for our healthcare professionals.  It is exceptionally important that we look at the substantive issues when it comes to paying consultants whom we desperately need to bring down our waiting lists.  There has been Trojan work done by the Government in that area but we need the medical professionals to do that work, whether it is children with spina bifida or multiple other long-term illnesses that need serious surgeries.  We need the surgeons to be here in Ireland and we are competing with countries that are paying far in excess of what surgeons can be paid here.  That has to be said.  Every citizen in this country wants to ensure when making contributions to the State that we will have a health service that is fit for purpose and can deal with the challenges in the event that people fall ill.<\/p>  <p>  It breaks my heart a little that we have so many people who come to Ireland to study medicine but do not stay here.  It costs hundreds of thousands of euro to train people to become doctors, which we do exceptionally well.  We have centres of excellence such as the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland just down the road from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Trinity College, University College Cork, the University of Limerick and the National University of Ireland Galway.  There are fabulous schools of medicines in those universities.  It is important that we look at the exodus of young doctors, people who go as junior doctors to travel abroad.  I understand that it is compulsory to get training abroad in order to become a consultant.  That is not what I am necessarily saying but I am aware of that.  It is a shame that we lose so many people.  Quality of life is a factor but pay is also a factor.  In Australia and Canada, for example, they earn multiples of what they can earn here.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise Deputy Mythen's point on rural GPs.  It is the same in east Cork.  The doctors' surgeries cannot take on any more patients.  A growing population is a factor and we have a slightly higher growth rate than the national average in east Cork.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is very familiar with my area.  This is a major concern for rural Deputies.  When people move into an area, they struggle to get in to see a general practitioner.  This shows why this legislation is needed, if it is going to help us bring in those medical professionals.  We certainly need to pursue more legislation in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  On home help, home care assistants and carers in general, a serious amount of work done has been done in this area throughout the pandemic, often in very difficult circumstances.  That has to be recognised, as the Minister of State has done.  I agree on backlogs.  When it comes to the Covid payment that was made to healthcare professionals, I would like to see outstanding issues resolved and I know the Minister of State and the Minister are working on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation is welcome, as is recognised by all sides of the House.  We need to look seriously at pay.  My message to the Secretary General of the Department of Health is that if he could address that, it would make an enormous difference to the quality of healthcare on this island and build upon the health service we have.  It is a profound concern that many people have.  The Minister of State and the Minister are acutely aware of that challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000024#W00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1663689600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I welcome many aspects of the Bill and am happy to speak on it.  Unfortunately, it does not do anything for the appalling conditions under which our non-consultant hospital doctors are working in terms of the gruelling hours and careless, slapdash and sometimes downright insulting institutional approach to their pay and conditions.  That they have to take to social media to highlight this is shameful.  It is no wonder doctors are emigrating in their droves or planning to do so, as are swathes of medical staff generally.  Deputy Mythen has already outlined a 45% increase in the number of work visas Australia has issued to Irish doctors.  This is a brain drain of the highest order.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned that the Bill fails to deal with the regulation of the home care sector.  This failure is bad for the superb people we have working in the sector.  It leaves them unprotected when they are working in other people's homes, certainly in the area of intimate care.  They have been calling for such regulations, as have HIQA and their unions.  We have a major problem when the HSE is spending over &euro;20 million a year on private healthcare providers when it should be providing home care directly and providing decent pay, conditions and pensions for workers.  This is vital as we move away from the nursing home care model and facilitate older people to stay in their own homes.  We need people to be able to happily choose careers in the home care sector and we need the public to be able to depend on the system for the quality of service and availability of workers.  I know people in north Kildare who are desperate for carers and home care.  It is no surprise given that 35,000 hours a week are not being provided and more than 4,500 people who have funding are waiting for care while their quality of health and life and their independence deteriorate.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know what obsession the Government has with profiting from and monetising the basic essentials of life such as housing, energy, childcare, healthcare, elder care and now home care.  We need public funds to directly benefit the public and to be used for the public benefit.  Instead, public funds are having to wrangle their way through middlemen and middle women so they can cut their slice of the profits.  This will be a priority for Sinn F&eacute;in in government.  It really should be a priority for this Bill, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000024#W00300","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1663689600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I am happy to support the legislation.  It is overdue in many respects.  There is no denying the importance of regulation, particularly in the health and social care area.  As we know, the legislation dates back to 2005 in respect of the inclusion of social care workers.  At the time, that was highly significant.  The work of dealing with children, older people and some of the most vulnerable people in our society is very important.  It is essential that the people working in that sector are properly regulated.  We have to ask why there has been such a delay.<\/p> <p>It is very important that the State has a regulatory system that we can have confidence in and that we legitimise the profession, protect the public and provide a structure for appraisal and approval of training and qualifications.<\/p> <p> However, as I said, the progress has been painfully slow.  I do not know why that is the case.  We are just moving at a piecemeal, slow pace when there are several professions that need to be regulated.  I do not know why we could not have done that by statutory instrument on an ongoing basis and why the progress could not have been quicker than has been the case.  I do not know why that is.  Is it a funding issue with CORU?  Is there a problem with CORU?  Why is it not able to move through the professions more quickly?  Alternatively, is it the case that it has requested the Minister to move on different professions and the Minister or, perhaps, successive Ministers have been slow to do that?  It is important we know the reason for what would appear to be a completely undue delay in regulating the professions.  As I said, health and social care professionals should all be regulated.  Why is it taking so long and why is it so slow?<\/p> <p> On social care workers, clearly the register is still not operational.  We are told that it is set to open in November 2023.  However, there are other requirements in terms of experience working in the sector.  Therefore, it is likely that with qualifications and experience, people will not be able to register until 2025.  Was this not foreseen?  Why was provision not made for this?  People have been working in this sector for years on end.  Are we talking about post-qualification experience?  What is it?  There is huge confusion about how one actually qualifies in this area.  Why have we not sorted this out before now?<\/p> <p> It is undoubtedly a complex environment for a couple of different reasons.  The previously unregulated status of social care work has been a problem in respect of new regulation.  The range and diversity of titles, practices and routes into the sector has been diverse and wide and all of that needed to be brought into line and streamlined.  Again, why that is only happening now?<\/p> <p> In 2018, a Social Care Ireland survey regarding registration awareness noted that respondents indicated 80 different job titles in that sector.  There have been some tangible developments in recent years.  In 2015, the social care workers registration board was established with CORU.  That was a certain amount of progress.  More recently, the code of professional conduct and ethics and the standards of proficiency in education and training were published.  However, there is still no clear pathway for fully regulated and recognised roles within social care.<\/p> <p> Obviously, serious problems arose in relation to those students in the Dublin Business School.  That was very bad practice all around.  It was a devastating blow for the students.  This course was established four years ago in 2018 and it is still not accredited by CORU.  Why was there not clarity about that?  The Dublin Business School has serious questions to answer in relation to that.  Students must now be provided with clear options to strengthen their qualifications.  The Minister raised the issue of refunds for students.  I do not know if that has happened, but it should happen.  However, more important than getting refunds is having a clear pathway to early recognition of the academic work that they have done and, indeed, for many of those students, the previous work experience they have had in the sector.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt that an acute shortage of social care workers is looming now.  Despite a relatively strong supply of graduates in this area, there is a shortage.  That is because the importance of social care was not recognised in this country until relatively recently.  There have been debates on this in the UK for the past 20 years.  We are very much fixed on the idea that we are talking about expensive healthcare and very highly qualified people.  We talk about consultants, GPs and nurses.  However, actually a huge amount of care in the general health area relates to social care.  That is where the big demands are.  We hear all of the publicity around long hospital waiting lists, and they are a scandal.  However, the reality is that most people who contact us as public representatives with regard to waiting lists are asking about older people, in particular, but also about young children and people with disabilities.  Effective and well-resourced social care is needed in all of those areas.  That is where the big demand is.  Very often, if people cannot access social care locally in their community, they are left in situations where their condition inevitably gets worse and they inevitably end up having to go to a consultant or be admitted into hospital.  A whole range of services needs to be properly recognised and resourced at community level.<\/p> <p> That, in many ways, is what Sl&aacute;intecare is about.  It is the lowest level of complexity.  People start off with different conditions that are not complex and need care and support.  That is the whole social care area.  If that is addressed, it has downstream effects.  It slows down conditions getting worse and becoming a bigger burden of demands on the health service.  We need to get back to early intervention, early diagnosis of conditions and providing appropriate staff in the appropriate place.  We have not been good at doing that in this country.<\/p> <p> In 2019, 14 educational providers were providing 34 social care programmes or pathways into social care.  This was happening.  The educational systems, particularly post-leaving certificate providers, were gearing up for that.  However, unfortunately, there was not the necessary recognition of those qualifications, which are very often level 5 qualifications, and then clear pathways provided into higher level qualifications, recognition of that and regulation.<\/p> <p> Between 2015 and 2019, Tusla experienced a 30% increase in referrals, but only a 1% increase in the social care workforce.  The austerity period brought very significant challenges with cuts, embargoes and moratoriums.  Of course, many of those cutbacks and austerity measures were very short-sighted because they resulted in even more serious problems and a lack of an adequately qualified and available workforce in this very important area.  The cost of living and spiralling rents, of course, added to that.<\/p> <p> This is a predominantly female profession.  Some 86.7% of respondents to a Social Care Ireland recruitment and retention survey in 2021 were female.  Increased privatisation and the use of agency workers to bolster the service provision has undoubtedly been a factor in this.  In many ways, we are seeing creeping privatisation in the social care area.  That is largely to do with the fact that at HSE level and at Department of Health level there is no recognition of the importance of social care.  It is seen as some kind of afterthought that should be farmed out to the voluntary sector.  People were doing it on a voluntary basis for a long time.<\/p> <p> That sector cannot operate on a shoestring, which is what the expectation was.  It was not professionalised and put onto a proper financial footing.  We are paying a big price for that now.  Due to the lack of recognition of the importance of social care, we ended up with a very expensive model of care in this country.  Services were dictated, in the main, by consultants, when we should have been looking at services at local level led out by social care professionals.<\/p> <p> Sl&aacute;intecare recognised that healthcare and social care are inextricably linked.  That has to be recognised.  <\/p> <p>Services and facilities have been disconnected or competing for far too long.  We should be operating a system of integrated care.  There has been recent recognition of that and I very much welcome the integrated care hubs that are being developed.  They make absolute sense.  They take work out of hospitals and they recognise the importance of health and social care professionals and the fact that they play, and are capable of playing, a key role in the delivery of health services and that can happen at community level.<\/p> <p> The current disconnect between healthcare and social care is very evident in waiting lists.  The health system waits until conditions become serious before intervening and that inevitably ends up with long waiting lists for hospital services.  On 5 July, there were 102 people across the acute system awaiting a discharge home, with 61 of them waiting for a carer to be assigned.  I do not have the up-to-date figures in that regard but what we have seen through the years is that there have been several hundred people in very expensive acute hospital beds ready to be discharged but there was insufficient funding at community care level to provide the kind of home supports they needed.  That issue, more than any other, typifies the dysfunction within the health service.  There are people using hospital beds who want to go home and are ready to go home and it is in their healthcare and other interests to do so.  It is a much cheaper model of care yet there is that disconnect between the acute hospital sector and social care.  It is the way we should be going.  There is no justification or defence for a situation where there is not an adequate budget for home care and then people end up staying in hospital beds which, in turn, has an impact on waiting lists.  More important, at the end of May there were 4,720 people waiting who had been assessed and approved for home support but were awaiting a carer to be assigned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000024#W00400","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663690800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We have the funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000026#Y00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1663690800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I know that.  That is what I am saying, however - they were assessed.  The bar is quite high to get approval for home care.  These were nearly 5,000 people who were approved for home care but the staff were not available.  This has been raised with the Minister of State.  In fairness, I know she is very committed to her portfolio but this has been raised with her on umpteen occasions.  One has to ask why this issue is not being addressed properly and why are we still in this indefensible situation.  From an organisational and financial point of view, it is indefensible.  The key thing, however, is that there are 5,000 people in their own homes, many of them in their late 80s and 90s and many very infirm, left in dangerous situations on their own at home.  It is inevitable that many of those people will end up going into nursing homes because there are not basic supports available to them at home.  That issue has to be addressed as an absolute priority.  When is the Minister of State going to resolve this?  It is dragging on far too long.  She promised a statutory right to home care.  When will we see that?  When will the staffing shortages be addressed?<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue there relating to the disparity in the contracts and the terms and conditions of employment in the community, voluntary and private sector home care areas.  The HSE funded and employed home care workers are on a regular and relatively decent salary.  They have security and all the other entitlements that permanent workers have.  People employed in the community sector or, more important, the private sector, however, are getting far less than they would as HSE workers.  The terms of the contract do not even recognise things such as travel time.  That can all be addressed by the Department.  It seems that the most recent tender was specifically designed to drive down the cost.  It represented a race to the bottom, essentially, and we are now paying a price for that.  In the new tender, the Minister has to address those issues and equalise the pay.  Ideally, far more of the home care staff should be employed by the State because it is a key area of health and social care provision.  We should seek to have those staff employed by the State.  I am concerned about the privatisation that is going on in this area in particular and the downgrading of that work.  We are paying a price for it now because of the staff shortages.  There is also the issue of the need for an employment regulation order to cover this.  I would very much welcome such an order.<\/p>  <p>  The same issue pertains in the disability sector, of course, in terms of the dire shortage of staff.  I refer to the children's disability network teams.  More than 17,000 children with disabilities are still awaiting their first contact in what was supposed to be a new system that would address their needs.  Of them, 8,000 are waiting more than a year.  The vacancy rate in the teams across the sector is approximately 28%.  That has to be dealt with as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  In the few minutes I have left, I note that the Medical Council's medical workforce intelligence report was published this month.  It lays bare major problems relating to non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  This issue has to be addressed.  There has been really good research done on this whole area, led by Dr. Niamh Humphries in the hospital doctor retention and motivation project that has been running in recent years.  Dr. Humphries and her colleagues appeared before the health committee earlier in the year.  I raised the matter with the Minister for Health on umpteen occasions.  That research sets out clearly why the majority of Irish-trained doctors are leaving our shores as soon as they can.  I raised this issue earlier today.  NCHDs are leaving Ireland in their droves.  They are leaving as a result of their poor treatment in their training.  Career structures are very poor and they have to move every six months.  Imagine doing that with a family and the crisis in housing.  How would one do it?  Some 25% of NCHDs are breaching the European directive on working hours.  They are forced to do that and cannot avoid it because hospitals are insisting that they work over the 48-hour limit.  Some of them do not even get paid for that work.  Imagine having that kind of gruelling regime and not even getting paid for it.  They complain of burnout, bullying within their profession and a general lack of respect.  They are leaving our shores in droves.  Is it any wonder that is happening?  There are currently almost 900 consultant vacancies.  Attention was drawn to this yesterday, particularly in the context of the impact of those vacancies on emergency departments, EDs, and the shocking conditions and waiting times that exist there.  That comes about largely as a result of major levels of consultant vacancies right across the board.  One can imagine the impact of those 900 consultant vacancies.  Is it any wonder that the health services cannot recruit to those posts, given the experiences of NCHDs early in their careers?  In addition, only 50% of the internationally trained healthcare graduates have access to a training programme in hospitals.  We are hugely dependent on them but they are being treated extremely badly.<\/p>  <p>  This is at the centre of the problems within the health service.  There are major problems in respect of recruitment and retention of staff and unless the Minister gets serious about this, sets up an urgent task force, ensures adequate placements in the health service and ensures adequate training places in colleges, the health service will continue to deteriorate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000026#Y00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1663690800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>The Bill has several important components that will remove unnecessary barriers in terms of registration with CORU, particularly for social workers.  Removing the requirement for two years of continuous work will be a big benefit.<\/p> <p>As we know, life gets in the way and sometimes it can be hard to source two continuous years of employment.  However, given the huge shortages of therapists, social care professionals and other important health care professionals, I hoped the Bill would be even more ambitious in speeding up the registration process for those seeking CORU registration from overseas.  Figures released to me recently via parliamentary questions show that the average processing time for registration has increased from 8.8 weeks last year to 9.6 weeks this year.  More worryingly, since 2020 some 697 qualified people, including occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists, have waited for more than three months for registration.  These people are ready to work and want to do so.  They are able to work in complex fields but are being delayed.  We leave them waiting for months, unable to contribute in their chosen professions.  This is particularly the case for those coming from other countries.  I note there is provision for UK degrees.  We should examine the possibility of extending these provisions for people who are properly qualified and accredited in other countries.  The reality is that children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, in particular are scandalously understaffed and this understaffing has a huge knock-on effect.  Existing staff are facing burnout, or have burnt out.  Last year the CDNT in my area had one occupational therapist for 893 children.  How is that acceptable in this day and age?  The pressure that person is under is unimaginable.  At the same time children fall through the gaps due to a lack of therapists, social workers and so forth.  Their chance of early intervention is lost because it takes years to have them assessed, to have the school places and to get them to therapies they desperately need.<\/p> <p> This Bill has the potential to impact positively on staffing levels for disability services.  I want the Minister to liaise with the Department to see what improvements can be made.  I am on the ground meeting with families and groups like Families Unite for Services and Support, FUSS, that are campaigning nationally for children with disabilities.  They are begging the Minister.

We welcome and support this Bill.  It is amazing to think that the Brexit referendum, which led to many anomalies, happened six and a half years ago.  As a consequence of Brexit, there has been a correction in regard to medical interns studying in Britain or the North of Ireland to come back here.  That is a good thing.  If we can attract professionals back into the Irish health system, it is a good thing.  There is also a downside to this.  I am probably preaching to the converted because the Minister of State knows the downside with regard to keeping people in the Irish public health system, which is the most important thing.  If graduate doctors, nurses and other allied professionals who are qualified at the highest grade in the world feel compelled to leave the country at the end of that process, we have a big problem.  We have to challenge that.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment, there is an enormous number of vacancies.  For example, there are vacancies for 900 medical consultants.  Such a void has consequences in regard to health care.  Other Deputies alluded to the junior doctors who issued an extraordinary statement a number of months ago regarding their conditions.  If doctors are saying that their working conditions in certain environments are unsafe, we should be concerned not only in regard to their own well-being but also patients&rsquo; well-being.  We are talking about life and death in some circumstances.  If they say these circumstances are extremely stressful and detrimental to the profession, this is a serious problem.   Like many other Deputies, I have said on several occasions that this issue has to be addressed immediately.  That is down to retention, recruitment and respect in regard to workers who have graduated and want to play their part, but circumstances go against them.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to refer to a statement that Dr. Fergal Hickey, who is the president of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, made on a radio show yesterday.  He painted a stark picture of emergency departments this year and beyond.  He stated that we need a plan for the whole year, and not just a winter plan, for sudden surges of influenza or Covid-19.  The Irish health system is not prepared for any sudden shocks.  It seems we were lucky a year and a half ago in regard to Covid-19.  If there had been a situation where there was an absolute oversurge in relation to emergency beds and acute beds, the Irish health system would have been in serious trouble.  Happily, that did not happen but it is still a possibility.<\/p>  <p>  My final comment relates to overall recruitment, retention and respect.  There are a number of reasons people stay in a country or in a job.  People are motivated to help their fellow human beings in the health system.  That is why they go into healthcare jobs, and stay in them, but there is a huge issue in regard to staff retention.  The reasons that people leave the Irish health service have to be addressed.  They are passionate about their jobs but they look at the related issues of cost of living and burnout.  I have friends who are nurses in the Irish health system.  They are motivated but find it difficult to stay in the system, particularly due to the cost of living.  It is detrimental to the Irish health system if we cannot keep these people.  If we cannot keep them, other health systems get them, to the detriment of Irish society.  We cannot afford to lose people like that.  We must recruit them, look after them, respect them and retain them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000027#Z00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1663691400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>We support the Bill.  As I understand it, the Bill essentially deals with one of the outworkings of Brexit by trying to recommence a situation that was the case before Brexit whereby medical graduates from the UK and the North can do internships here.  That would be beneficial for the health service here.  We support what the Bill is trying to achieve.  As others have said, it highlights the fact that we have a more general problem in recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals in multiple disciplines across the health service to the point that it is fair to say our health service is creaking at the seams.  Many people in the health service are demoralised and burnt out, and are leaving the public health service to work in the private sector.  Alternatively, they leave the country entirely or leave the health professions because they simply cannot bear the pressure, stress and conditions they face across much of the health services.  Indeed, a family member of mine has been in hospital for several months.  He sings the praises of all the staff who look after him but every time I go to see him he tells me that the nurses and health care assistants are run off their feet.<\/p> <p>They are burned out, are dealing with too many patients and they just cannot cope quite a good deal of the time.  We have a problem.  In broad terms, as Deputy Gino Kenny has said, we have to listen to the people on the front line as to what they think is necessary in order to resolve the situation and we are not doing that.  I am not going to list all of the different groups of healthcare professionals that we should be listening to but I want to speak up for just a few that I have been talking to recently.<\/p> <p> The first of these groups is physiotherapists.  I hope that the Minister is aware that physiotherapists are making what seems to me to be a very reasonable request and it may be something that could even possibly be dealt with by amendments to this legislation.  It certainly seems to be a very easy legislative change that could have a significant impact in addressing some of the waiting lists that we have in our health service.  The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy is saying that physiotherapists need to be included in the list of people who are allowed to refer for X-ray.  I did not know this until up they informed me of it but physiotherapists cannot refer people for X-ray.  As a consequence, they have to needlessly chase after other people who are on the legislative list, because it is set down in law, of either doctors or certain grades of nurses - there may be some other groups - who are allowed to refer for X-ray.  <\/p> <p> This is wasting the time of those doctors and nurses who could be doing other things when the physiotherapists know that somebody needs to be referred for an X-ray.  This is adding unnecessarily to the stress on other healthcare professionals and it means longer waiting times for people to get the treatment they need.  The simple measure they are requesting is that they be allowed to refer people for X-ray, as is the case, they inform me, in many other health jurisdictions and I believe it was in fact committed to as part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is very elementary stuff and I would appeal that this might be done.  <\/p> <p> The legislation that is referred to is a statutory instrument, SI 256\/2018, that needs to be changed to simply include physiotherapists, as a group, who along with others -  I believe dentists are among them - who are allowed to make such referrals, and so on.  Physiotherapists should be allowed to do this.  That seems like a good measure and I recommend that the Minister of State might read their submission on this because the figures are quite stark.  It says that the numbers that this could potentially deal with and the impact on waiting lists could be very substantial.  I will not go through all of the details but this is about joined-up thinking and having the most efficient use of the skilled people that we have in our health service and not unnecessarily burdening others who are already overrun with demands on them, in particular, doctors and nurses.  I hope that the Minister of State will listen to this request, please.<\/p> <p> The second group I would like to speak up for is one I have spoken up for on many occasions.  This has been well-aired and the Government should be aware of the issue of psychologists.  As we know, we are in dire need of a great deal more psychologists to do assessments for people with disabilities, children with special needs, in particular, and then to provide services for children with special needs, and so on.  There is a whole range of other areas, indeed, where there is a shortage of psychologists.  We need them and the paradox and irony of this is that there are many young people who want to be psychologists but there are totally unnecessary obstacles being put in the way of these people who want to study psychology, who want to work with children with special needs, with people with mental disabilities, mental health issues, and so on.  As we know, we have absolutely dire waiting lists where people are not getting their assessments in the time that they are legally entitled to get them and are not getting the services.  We know in our mental health teams, our child and adolescent mental health services teams and community mental health teams, that there is a very urgent need for more psychologists.  Yet, if one wishes to do a doctorate in psychology, one has big obstacles if one is doing this in the area of education or counselling psychology.  Clinical psychologists who are doing their doctorates will get a salary for the placement work they do and will get a very substantial amount of the very high fees that they are asked to pay.  These are fees of up to &euro;15,000, which is extraordinary.<\/p> <p> Many, and I have talked to these young people who want to be psychologists, if they are not being paid on placement through the counselling psychology doctorate, and if they have to shoulder fees of &euro;15,000, as some of them have put it to me, if they are working class, on a low income and do not have the money, they cannot be a psychologist.  They will be forced to drop out and it is just too much.  Why do we have a situation where we fund some - not enough I would suggest - clinical psychology doctorates, to some degree, by giving them a salary and paying most of their fees and we do not do the same for educational and counselling psychology?  It makes no sense.<\/p> <p> Again, I refer the Minister of State to the Psychological Society of Ireland&rsquo;s budget submission and is not the first time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000027#Z00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663692000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I met the society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000028#AA00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1663692000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has met the society.  To me it is a slam dunk that we should do this.  I am coming across a considerable number of young people who are very interested in the area of mental health, they want to go into this area and we are putting obstacles in their way which makes no sense.  The society says that the figures for extending the salary and the assistance with fees for education and counselling psychology is a derisory &euro;1.7 million.  It is nothing.  It says that an additional 50 trainee psychological posts across the professional doctoral programmes for a five-year period would be an extra &euro;2.45 million.  That is &euro;12 million over five years. That, again, is buttons compared to the wider health budget but would have a very serious impact.  It is also saying that in order co-ordinate the management and placement of current and increased numbers of trainees, the Government should fund with immediate effect the establishment of a national psychology placement office, as the HSE has recommended, which would require the funding of just a measly &euro;770,000 per year.  Again, this is buttons but could have a very real impact.<\/p>  <p>  Incidentally, when one thinks about the sort of mental health issues, and so on, that we have in our schools, I believe that we should have psychology departments in every single school in this country.  It would be a great assistance to our young people. who are significantly impacted by all kinds of mental health issues and need support.  There are many young people out there who want to do this kind of work, to work with other young people, but we need to make it easy for those who want to do this, to get the qualifications and placements they need, and then to move into working in our health services.<\/p>  <p>  One other group which I will quickly give a shout out for is the graduate entry level medical students, that is the people who have previous degrees, graduate entry level students.  I believe there is a particular name for this group which the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials, I am sure, will know the name of.  These are people who have done other degrees and now want to move on to medicine.  They have not done a primary medical degree, have done another degree, and then go on to do medicine.  There is a pathway for them to move from whatever other degree they have done into medicine but, again, they are faced with completely shocking fees.  This is crazy.  When we have such a shortage of doctors, why are we putting obstacles in the way of people who want to study medicine and who want to work in our health service?<\/p> <p>The other broad point I would make on recruitment and retention, which came up with regard to the student nurses, could apply to a lot of healthcare professional areas where there are real difficulties in people just surviving day to day, whether they are studying nursing, midwifery or in other areas.  The people I have mentioned often have real day-to-day cost of living and accommodation issues.  Because they are studying, they are not paid properly and they cannot afford accommodation so they drop out.  There are all sorts of pressures on them.  We should introduce bursary schemes to incentivise people, essentially to fund them in these areas of healthcare where we have a dire shortage of people, whether it is in nursing, midwifery, psychology or elsewhere.<br\/><br\/>The <i>quid pro quo<\/i>could for such bursary schemes is that if people get a decent bursary, they would then commit to working for a few years in the health service after they qualify.  We assist them in getting through their qualifications so they are not struggling, they are not paying shocking fees and they get some sort of proper stipend to sustain them and allow them to pay their accommodation costs and, as a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>, they commit to giving a few years in the health service, rather than leave the country, as so many do because the situation is so difficult for them.  Those are a few practical suggestions.<br\/><br\/>We are theoretically committed to this under Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have a lot of the capacity we need in the health service but the problem is that a significant section of that capacity is privatised because we have a two-tier system.  That is just crazy.  I am infuriated when I hear the ads for private emergency departments and private hospitals.  The implication of these ads that we hear on the radio every day is that if people go to the public emergency department, they will be waiting for half a day, a day or two days in a war zone, but &ldquo;Come to us, if you can afford to pay, and you will get treated straight away.&rdquo;  The capacity is there but it is only there if people can pay.  There is significant additional capacity in the private system but only available to people who can afford to pay very expensive private health insurance.  That speaks to the obvious need to integrate and to have a single-tier, universal, publicly-run system, rather than the two-tier system that we have.  We were forced to recognise the need to do that during Covid so surely we should make that a permanent state of affairs by having an integrated, single-tier, universal public health system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000028#AA00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663692600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>We support the Bill and some of the amendments, which are worthwhile.  I want to take this opportunity to raise a number of issues.  No dentist in County Kerry will take on medical card patients at the moment.  There was one in Killorglin but the staff were so overwhelmed with requests from across the county that they had to stop taking new patients.  I was particularly struck by the case of a man who came to me.  He had been working abroad for approximately 30 years.  He came home needing to have a crown fixed and he expected the same level of healthcare that he had in the country from where he had come to retire.  He was staggered that even though he had a medical card, he was not able to get that service.  He was searching around the Ring of Kerry, looking for a dentist, and he could not get one.  He came to me and I had to pull a favour from a dentist I knew to get him the treatment he so urgently needed.  That is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, there has been a haemorrhage of dentists from the dental treatment services scheme because the services covered are insufficient to provide dental care and the reimbursement rates are so low that dentists are losing money and it is costing them more to keep the practice going than they receive for treating a patient.  The number of dentists holding these contracts nationwide had been in excess of 1,000; it declined from 1,600 in 2017 and now only 600 dentists throughout the country are actively treating medical card patients.<\/p>  <p>  Primary school dental check-ups are running two to three years behind schedule, which means children with orthodontic needs are delayed getting on the waiting lists.  The dental clinics in Kerry have treatment waiting lists that are five years long and orthodontists are coming into the county to provide treatment.  The physical and emotional harm being inflicted on young people as they wait while their teeth get worse during puberty is unacceptable.  What is the Government doing, in particular for Kerry, to ensure there is at least one dentist taking on medical card holders in each local electoral area, LEA?<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week, I met with members of the INTO regarding their pre-budget submissions and one of their four main demands stood out, which related to mental health support for pupils.  Other speakers have mentioned the necessity for therapies and psychological services to be made available in primary schools, where children can be seen without having the stigma of having to leave the school or the classroom to go to see a psychologist or speech and language therapist on the other side of town, if they eventually get that service.  I was informed that the number of primary schools referred to CAMHS and other services rose 40% during the pandemic.  Special education teachers are trying to act as a stopgap to perform the task.  Early intervention therapies in schools are working but more help is needed.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the pandemic bonus payment, staff are still waiting ten months on from when the promise was made who are working privately in the public system.  It shows the level of two-tier unfairness in the system that they are still waiting at this late stage for their payment.  What is being done to sort that out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000029#BB00200","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1663692600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I am aware of a number of the issues that relate to this Bill, especially the case of the Dublin Business School, and I have been in contact with many of the students in that regard.  The school has hugely failed the students regarding their particular qualifications.  Many of these students have spent big money and many have taken time out of their own jobs and have changed careers.  Many have spent a lot of time on placement so they could qualify with the Dublin Business School, and they are now left in limbo without the proper, clear commitment that their issue will be fixed for them.  I welcome any legislation that potentially helps their situation in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise a couple of other issues that relate to this Bill and to look back on the historical nature of social care and how problems have existed with that.  We need to make sure we have good legislation with good, strong regulation as well.  I previously raised issues in the House regarding the internal case reviews and the practice assurance and service monitoring, PASM, reviews conducted by Tusla.  In particular, I raised the case of Alice and I was shocked to discover at that time that the Government was not aware of the Alice report, despite the fact Alice had emailed and telephoned the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, office on many occasions prior to my raising it in the D&aacute;il.  He also stated that he was not aware of the 13 other internal case reviews that were completed.  Surely, given the gravity of these reports, they should be shared between the Department and Tusla.  I can only presume that the Minister has sought them from Tusla since I raised them here.<\/p>  <p>  I know he met with Alice a few months ago, along with my parliamentary assistant, Luke Silke, and I want to thank him for that meeting with her.  Alice is obviously a pseudonym that Tusla ascribed to this woman, who was abused in foster care in the State, physically, emotionally and sexually, in the 1980s and 1990s.  There are a number of other issues with the Alice case that I would like to raise.  I have already raised issues specifically regarding whether the other 16 foster children who lived in the same home with Alice and her siblings were interviewed.  This question has not been answered and it is a key question that has to be answered, either by garda&iacute; or social workers.  It has been some time since I raised the questions and I am incredibly frustrated that they have not been answered.  I would also like to know what happens currently if a child makes a disclosure to a social worker or to other children in homes.  Again, I asked that question of the Minister a number of months ago and it has not been answered.<\/p>  <p>  Second, when Alice's sister, Ms H, made a disclosure of sexual abuse within foster care, the Tusla report notes that the alleged abuser was interviewed, confessed to the abuse and a file was sent to the DPP, but the DPP decided not to prosecute.<\/p> <p>Again, I cannot comprehend this.  In recent months, Ms H applied for her files under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the Garda wrote back to her to say it had located a PULSE record number but the file was empty.  It appears that no file was sent to the DPP.  There remains confusion and mixed messages over exactly what happened to the file.  This has caused untold hurt to Ms H, who is now an adult.  Her wounds have been reopened.  Will the Government trigger an investigation to determine where these files have gone and to ensure they are located and returned to Ms H?  A PULSE file that has potentially been emptied is a very serious matter, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Alice and her family, the State completely failed them.  Alice was taken from her parents, where she had been abused, and was placed by the State in a foster care home in which she and her siblings endured further abuse.  It is a nightmare scenario for any child to have gone through.  Her birth mother wrote to the social workers about this abuse prior to her death in 1989 but, despite this, Alice continued to reside with the foster care family until March 1992, at which point she left the home with &pound;10 in her pocket, bought a bus ticket and applied for a job in a nursing home.  She built a life on a ten pound note.  It is important to flag that she was never removed from that home.  The only way she could escape it was by running away from the abuse.  There were multiple case conferences and multiple occasions on which disclosures or additional information were made available to social workers and the Garda but no investigation was conducted for decades.<br\/><br\/>This case and the reports I have examined lead me to believe that either we have a cover-up in which the Garda and the social workers conspired to protect the foster parents from the allegations being made against them by the children, or else we have a country that loudly, clearly and collectively said it does not believe children simply because they are children.  This report appeared to adopt an attitude of not believing any of these children.  The problem is that since we have divulged this information here, the response of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will be that the Government shall ignore it until it goes away.<br\/><br\/>In recent years, Alice triggered a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, investigation into the Garda station that failed to act on her abuse disclosures in the past.  During that investigation, the Garda station wrote to a local authority and falsely told it Alice had committed an offence.  I believe this action had a negative effect on her housing application.  I will repeat that to ensure we all understand what is going on here.  Alice triggered a GSOC investigation into a Garda station that failed to act on the abuse disclosures she gave in the past and, as a result, the Garda station wrote to a local authority falsely accusing Alice of an offence she had not committed and this caused difficulty for her in applying for a council house.<br\/><br\/>These are some of the hurdles Alice has faced in her campaign for justice.  They have been extraordinary.  I believe she has been actively persecuted by the State for speaking out against the system.  In recent years, for example, Alice was referred for counselling and psychological assistance free of charge after Tusla took charge of this historic case.  At the mental health unit to which she was referred, Alice spoke about the social worker who had failed to disclose what happened to her.  She found out that social worker is actively employed by the HSE as a mental health worker.  One can imagine the pain for Alice of not being believed in a scenario where she is with a psychiatrist and being told the lady in the room next door was the social worker who wronged her in the past.  This is just another example of how she has been wronged.  Alice was later to discover, through her incredible and comprehensive detective work, that a social worker from her past is currently married to a GSOC officer.  I do not suggest for a minute this had any bearing on the GSOC investigation but for a woman who has gone through at least five or six wrongs by the State, it is another incredible situation to arise.<br\/><br\/>One of the saddest things about this story is that when Alice brought the information to us, she told us she had found out her birth mother had died.  She found this out simply from being at mass and hearing the priest tell the congregation who was recently deceased.  One can only imagine finding out in this manner that one's birth mother had died.  This story highlights the difficulties so many children go through in this State.  It also focuses on how important it is to have social workers who are of the highest standard and are governed by the best regulation.<br\/><br\/>I refer to another internal case review conducted by Tusla.  Again, I have the permission of the victim, to whom the pseudonym Karen was given.  Like Alice, Karen was left in an abusive home, with the knowledge of the social workers, and had to take it upon herself to run away from that home to escape the abuse.  The time period was the same, that is, the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In Karen's case, the alleged perpetrator was never prosecuted, despite a file nearly a foot thick being sent to the DPP.  Like Alice, Karen received a small settlement from the HSE in a very secretive and questionable manner outside the courts.  Like the Alice report, the report on Karen's case has discrepancies in what the Garda has said.  I will focus on a couple of extracts from the report that I believe are important.<br\/><br\/>Karen first disclosed sexual abuse in 1984 at the age of nine.  In a video I have seen of Karen as a child in 1986, in which she outlines to social workers the nature of the assaults on her, she describes how she was sexually assaulted repeatedly by her mother's partner.  She was also sexually assaulted by the next-door neighbour.  The Tusla review states that the neighbour was fined &pound;75 for that incident.  It is incredible that this was the level of justice achieved by Karen in that circumstance.  Astonishingly, after the abuse disclosure, of which the local hospital, the local child guidance clinic, CGC, and the Garda were aware, Karen was sent back to the same home.  In February 1985, she made further disclosures of sexual abuse.  The local GP visited the home and Karen was admitted to the local hospital.  When she was released after a short period and referred to the CGC, which was the equivalent of CAMHS at that time, she was released home again.<br\/><br\/>Karen escaped the abuse in 1986.  The Tusla report states:<\/p><blockquote>\tKaren had made numerous attempts to run away from home.  On 31st August 1986, it was recorded that Karen ran away, stole a bike and travelled about a mile from her home before it rained.  Cold and tired she saw a light on in a nearby house and when given access broke down and disclosed to the household owner about the alleged abuse. <\/blockquote> <p>One would hope this was the end of it but, no, it was not.  Karen was put in the care of the State and after a brief spell in foster care, she was placed in an institution.  In this State at the time, if you were a victim of sexual abuse, in many cases, you were placed in an institution.  The review notes that Karen ran away from the institution and slept rough in Dublin, where she was exposed to prostitution and heavy drug use, although she did not partake in either.<br\/><br\/>This is the way children were treated in the past in this country.  Every time we raise these questions, we are assured things are different now and that policies and safeguards have been strengthened.  The legislation we are discussing must do right by the students of the Dublin Business School who have suffered, but it also must ensure we have the highest level of regulation of, and the best level of investment in, these resources and that we protect the children who currently are in the care of the State.  That is not the case.  I know this is not necessarily the Minister of State's particular area of authority but I ask that she or the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, meet with the two women I have discussed today.  They and others like them have done their best to achieve a certain level of justice for themselves and, in many cases, after contacting Departments and State agencies and organisations, they were rebuffed and sent back home.  In many cases, the only level of justice they might receive is that their case is discussed as a pseudonym case on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  That is wrong.<\/p> <p>We must ensure we meet and speak to these adults.  Equally, we must ensure that all the different hurdles they had to surmount and the wrongs they suffered, as well as those instances where the State let them down and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, GSOC and Tusla did not do their jobs, are investigated and justice is provided for them.  That should be the baseline standard for people in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000029#BB00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663693800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mattie McGrath next.

The Minister of State will be aware these regulations were made by her predecessor in 2018.  Members were appointed to the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board in May 2019.  The board has 12 very experienced members and it met three times in 2019, four times in 2020 and seven times in 2021 and it has met six times so far in 2022.  Therefore, the board has met 20 times since 2019.  Four years after the Minister of State's predecessor initiated this process and after 20 meetings of the board, we still do not know when counsellors and psychotherapists will be regulated through CORU.  I have met representatives of groups, as I am sure has the Minister of State, such as the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and Therapists for Change.  They are not able to tell their members when they will be regulated in respect of their concerns.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, I sent an email to the Minister of State earlier this month on behalf of the Therapists for Change group, which I will now read.  It states that the author is writing to the Minister of State as a member of Therapists for Change, that she may remember that the organisation wrote to her in June 2021 and April 2022 to ask if she could meet with its representatives and that, in good faith, the Minister of State responded with the suggestion that Therapists for Change contact CORU, which was appreciated.  The email message continues that when the organisation wrote to CORU on 25 April 2022 seeking a meeting, CORU responded with a generic letter and did not address the request.  The email points out that Therapists for Change wrote to CORU again on 10 June 2022 and notes that no response has yet been received.<\/p>  <p>  It will be appreciated that counsellors and psychotherapists have many concerns about statutory regulation and how that will effect them, including whether the courses they are undertaking or have completed will be eligible for registration.  As discussed already, we heard about the situation with students in the Dublin Business School who were sold courses for social care roles and now find they may not be eligible for registration with CORU.  Some counsellors and psychotherapists find themselves in this situation too.  Concerns also include how and if a grandparent scheme will be put in place.  Psychotherapists need to make plans to ensure that what they are doing now meets the criteria for future registration.<\/p>  <p>  A meeting with CORU to answer these questions would allay the fears of Therapists for Change and make the transition as problem free as possible.  It would also be a gesture of goodwill.  The group is writing to the Minister of State to see if she can meet with them or intervene with CORU to see if a meeting with its representatives can be arranged.  The group would very much appreciate the Minister of State's advice and help with this matter so some clarity can be brought to the situation for the great many counsellors and psychotherapists who are anxious about their future.  I note the Minister of State probably cannot answer now, but will she agree to have this meeting or could she intervene with CORU in respect of setting up a meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000031#DD00700","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1663693800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>That is much appreciated.

This Bill seeks to bring some decorum or measure of change and adjustment to what is needed.  This whole area needs massive change.  We can have all the regulations and Bills like this and all the grandiose titles and amendments, memorandums and everything else, but people want services.  The Minister of State knows that.  A Teachta D&aacute;la living in any constituency knows this about the services having the required healthcare professionals to deliver these services in a professional and timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, the services are not timely.  In some cases, unfortunately, there are questions about the profession too.  We heard An Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's contribution.  This is not the first time I have heard his point and I have discussed it with him.  We all have heard of cases where people are languishing on waiting lists for professional therapy and help, from the cradle to the grave, literally.  It is most troubling when we see young people trying to get assessments in respect of special and particular educational needs, language needs and all kinds of therapies.  Yet they cannot get them.  This is where the real problem is.  We can have all the legislation, aspirations and flowery words and sentences and acronyms we want, but that is all pointless if we cannot get the services.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing is more frustrating for a family, whether there is one parent or two or a whole family with siblings, than when a child with special and additional needs does not have those needs determined because the family cannot get access to the professional services required.  The lives of the children concerned and their families could change if it was possible to get a diagnosis and additional supports.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.  We can go on to the areas of autism, dyspraxia, dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, etc.  My late brother was a paediatrician, and quite a good one from what I hear from his patients.  He had a keen interest, God rest him, in children with learning difficulties and any kind of needs.  He travelled the world and gained expertise.  I still meet families today, and it is nice, who come up to tell me they miss him so much some 11 and 12 years later.  The crucial thing is that the patient, whether young or old, must be at the centre of our healthcare system, but unfortunately that is not the case.  <\/p>  <p>  The system has seriously regressed since the dreaded Covid-19.  Many people are not back to work in places and there are skeleton services and people working from home or whatever.  I am not here to undermine or challenge the staff.  Some great people are working in the HSE and other care areas, including in mental health.  There are, however, some amount of cracks in the system, and needs, trauma and anguish.  We saw people lobbying today, with music and entertainment on the street.  I met a special lady, whose name eludes me, who gave us a rendition in the audiovisual room and a bit of a recital.  Why are people like her punished and why is the system cruel to them?  We must praise their ability rather than remarking on their disability.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  Indeed, mol na daoine agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  It is our abilities and what people can do that we must praise, and not our disabilities.  There is a major opportunity here for learning and brushing up on what we do, instead of the slippage we have experienced.<\/p>  <p>  I recently met a retired person who used to look after home care hours and applications.  She told me she was delighted to be gone because there was no bother getting home care hours and packages now, but there was nobody to fulfil the hours.  We have a flight of experts in this area.  Home carers are experts in their own right.  Many of them do not have degrees as such, but they have degrees in understanding, care, passion and supporting people who are sick.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  I refer to carers as well.  I always wear a carers' badge, but it is covered up by the mental health badge this evening.  We have questions about the mental health budget as well.<\/p> <p>I met the people lobbying downstairs as well.  In a proper system, these people should not have to lobby but, unfortunately, they have to.  Maybe it is the big organisations, the more powerful ones, that can lobby strongest that will get the best outcomes.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, as regards carers and home care packages, the approach is so short-sighted.  It is easy to announce all the money.  The Taoiseach, when anybody questions him, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister state there are so much in additional budgets but they are not there.  Carers are run ragged and they are tired, with the distance now travelled, the cost of fuel and everything else.  I am conscious of the impacts they make and the joy that they bring to people in their homes on home care visits.  They keep them out of hospital and accident and emergency departments.  A complete overhaul is needed to put more funding into community services.  This Bill should be about enabling that but it is not happening.<\/p> <p> Recently, a nurse told me that 67% of her class were in Australia.  They have done so much learning here and done so much to join the wonderful and noble profession of nursing only to emigrate.

This should come as no surprise given who designed it.  This winter Deputies can access retrofitting quicker than two pensioners burning coal to heat one room.  That is deeply unfair.  It is not right.  The Government's plan needs to be overhauled.  We need a plan at a time of crisis that is targeted, based on need not ability to pay, flexible and responsive and one that will be rolled out rapidly and efficiently.<\/p><p>The Government has stated that 58% of its retrofitting budget is going to energy poverty schemes but the truth is queues are getting longer and budgets are not being spent.  In fact, the Government is siphoning off money to pay for diesel back-up generators.  The Government's retrofitting plan is deeply inequitable.  It fails the equity test and the just transition test.<\/p><p>I will make a number of points of specific criticism.  People who need retrofits - those living in the coldest and poorest homes - cannot access them.  For people who are eligible for schemes, more than 9,000 homes are on waiting lists for works under the better energy warmer homes scheme, with a wait time of 27 months, which is getting longer.  Otherwise, strict criteria mean that people are not eligible for schemes and they do not have the upfront money.  They cannot put their hands on the money.  People who have less need - those living in warmer homes - can access retrofits because they have access to funds.  There is wait of greater than two years or a closed door, on the one hand, while, on the other, there is access based on ability to pay.  This approach certainly fails the equity test.<\/p><p>There is a shortage of workers and those workers are, as a result, being inefficiently deployed to demand-led, random houses here and there.  Contractors say they have never been more burdened with paperwork and bureaucracy.  People who want to access individual grants are being denied because of upfront costs.  The bureaucracy involved means budgets will be unspent.  As I mentioned, &euro;40 million has already been siphoned off this year's retrofitting budget.<\/p><p>In solar photovoltaic, PV, people face barrier after barrier.  There is significant potential here.  On solid fuel, people have been browbeaten over turf but no alternatives have been provided.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s plan would address all of these issues and it would do it without increasing carbon taxes.  We would invest &euro;503 million in retrofits in 2023.  That is &euro;153 million more than the Government's 2022 allocation &ndash; the outturn will be far less - and far ahead of its 2023 capital allocation.  That money would be spent in a far fairer and more efficient way.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in would take a targeted, plan-led and area-based approach based on need rather than ability to pay.  It would cluster houses together with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, as the lead agency working hand in hand with local authorities and other housing agencies and with one-stop shop contractors acting as delivery vehicles, commissioned by local authorities, the SEAI and private individuals, driving competition within the one-stop shop system and reducing costs.  As we grow the workforce through expanded dedicated training in education and training boards, ETB, programmes, this area-based, plan-led approach would use existing resources efficiently and effectively.  We would prioritise existing applicants on the better energy warmer homes scheme but we would replace that programme, broaden eligibility criteria for those on higher incomes and dedicate an additional &euro;73 million to that.  Works would be subsidised on a tiered basis based on income.  We would also provide a 50% increase in funding for local authority housing, which would protect those most at risk of poverty and fuel poverty and the impact of the rising cost of energy.<\/p><p>Acting on the call of the Climate Change Advisory Council and the hundreds of thousands of people who are excluded from individual grants because they do not have the upfront costs, we would ensure that applications for individual grants, for example, for attic and cavity wall insulation, are assessed quickly and that upfront grant payments are made.  We are in a time of crisis.  The money needs to get out as quickly as possible and contractors need to be put to work.<\/p><p>We also have proposals for a dedicated scheme for those on solid fuel and additional spending on solar PV.  We have a clear plan.  The Minister needs to change tack and support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000032#EE00400","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1663694400,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, for tabling this important motion.  The Government's retrofit plan is not equitable.  It excludes a large proportion of middle-income households, specifically those who do not qualify for free upgrades but do not have the significant cash reserves needed to access the one-stop shop service.<\/p>  <p>  The prioritisation of wealthier households also contributes to the growing delays for those living in energy poverty, as evidenced by the better energy warmer homes scheme.  The scheme is aimed at the most vulnerable households but there are now 9,000 people on that waiting list and the wait time has shot up to 27 months.  Between 2019 and the end of January 2022, only 118 homes in County Cavan and 85 in County Monaghan had been completed under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical that we put in place a fair retrofit plan that will help lower and middle-income households.  Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget proposes a significant increase in the retrofitting budget for 2023 and targets funding towards those who need it most and the poorest, coldest and most carbon-intensive homes.  We would replace the better energy warmer homes scheme with a new scheme for low- and middle-income households, which includes area-based components and increased funding from the current &euro;109 million to &euro;182 million next year.  This scheme would see the continuation of free home energy upgrades for current eligible social welfare recipients but it would also introduce a tiered grant support, ranging from 65% to 100%-funded deep retrofits, for low- and middle-income households depending on income.  We would increase the local authority retrofit budget by 50%, from &euro;85 million to &euro;127.5 million, as those in social housing are most likely to be at risk of energy poverty and, therefore, in greater need of home energy upgrades.<\/p>  <p>  We also propose a new &euro;50 million retrofitting scheme for homes that rely on solid fuels for heating, which would particularly benefit households in rural areas.  It would help improve air quality and health and at the same reduce energy poverty.  Sinn F&eacute;in aims to put alternatives in place first, unlike the Government approach to solid fuel homes which relies on punitive action, such as turf bans and carbon tax hikes.<\/p>  <p>  We would also establish a local energy action fund that would provide &euro;8 million for sustainable energy communities to fund local community-led retrofits and increase the funding for solar panels, bringing the budget for that purpose up to &euro;24.5 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000032#EE00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1663695000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, on bringing forward the motion.  It is very clear that the retrofit scheme the Government has in place is not working and not delivering for very many people the length and breadth of the country, particularly those on middle incomes, who may be paying down a mortgage and who have all the other various issues in life to try to deal with.  They simply cannot afford to take out another loan, which is what the Government insists they have to do to be able to retrofit their house properly.  It becomes unaffordable to them.  As my colleagues have outlined, a scheme needs to be put in place whereby we would have a tiered system, those on the lowest incomes could get a larger grant and that would tier off as people would get onto higher incomes.  I have come across numerous people in my constituency, as I am sure the Minister has in his constituency, who want to do this work and are committed to doing it but find they simply cannot afford it because the scheme in place does not fit their income thresholds and where they are in their lives.  If the Government is committed, as we understand it is or as it continues to tell us that it is, to dealing with the carbon emergency and the climate emergency we face, not just in Ireland but globally, we have to be able to assist people to do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  The motion before us does that.  It ensures that the money is put in the right place, ensuring in turn that the people who have the coldest homes, the homes that need the most energy-efficient retrofitting, have the means to pay for that retrofitting.  That is why we appeal to the Minister to change tack.  The way this has been done up to now is simply is not working.  The fact that we are heading for a three-year waiting list, with more than 9,000 people waiting, tells us there is a problem here.  It needs to be adjusted and the Minister needs to ensure that adjustment is delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, solar panels and solar PV panels are one of the projects that I know very many people around the country consider doing and would love to be able to do but, again, they find that affordability is the big problem.  In many other jurisdictions governments put solar panels in place on people's houses for free.  Then, after a number of years, the householder takes ownership of them.  There is no imagination at all on this Government's part to deliver that idea of microgeneration such that people may produce their own power for their houses.

I think everyone would accept that we are in a very different world now and we need to make sure we do all that is necessary in order that we are not all under water or in far worse conditions over the coming years.  For us to do that, we have to ensure that we have fit-for-purpose grants and actions taken by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  We are dealing with queues and difficulties and obstacles that people say are being thrown up as they attempt to do the right thing by retrofitting.  That has been going on since long before we ended up in the situation we are in now.  We know that we need to move away from fossil fuels, not just because it is the right thing to do or because we are addicted to them but also because, beyond that, we do not have the strategic autonomy that is required.  That is the determination being made across Europe, so we need to look at this again and ensure we target those who most need these retrofits.  The problem is we have put in place schemes and systems whereby those who have the most money and, in some cases, the best houses, including from the point of view of heat and energy retention, are able to go out into the world, put their money on the table and get the retrofits, whereas those who are living in the worst of conditions are not getting what is necessary.

I do not know if the Minister remembers this, but a number of months ago he talked about retrofitting and the plans in that regard.  As far as I know, there are roughly 172,000 social houses in the State.  I think 36,000 of those are at an energy efficiency level that is adequate or better.  Some 36,000, I think, are earmarked to be retrofitted between now and 2030.  That leaves 100,000 homes of some of the most vulnerable and poorest people in the State with no retrofitting until at least 2030.  I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity, but how could that be right?<\/p>  <p>  My party colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, is trying to bring forward solutions and make a difference.  Why is the Government and, in particular, the Minister, a person who cares about the environment and should care about the most vulnerable, not backing what we are trying to do?  I have an example in Fair Hill, in Cork, where two houses were to get retrofitting, including wraparound insulation, windows - the whole lot.  One family could get it done with the grant because they had the resources to pay for the rest themselves.  The other family, two pensioners living on a fixed income, could not get it done.  The people who needed it the most were the two pensioners but they were the people who could not get it done, and that is under the Minister's watch.

I will list another one.  In early August 2020, Kevin and Yvonne Conroy left their home just outside Mullingar to have a deep retrofit programme done.  Today, almost 26 months later, they remain out of their home.  Words simply cannot describe the severe emotional and financial distress experienced by this family, whom members of the Government, including the Minister, and the SEAI are aware of.  Their experience has been nothing other than utterly horrendous and has, to my mind, shown the SEAI in an extremely poor light.<\/p>  <p>  The initial complaint was made in December 2020.  It took until November 2021 for Kevin and Yvonne to be assured that they were a priority and that they would be back in their home without further delay.  February this year brought more promises from the SEAI, but from March to September the grant agreement remained in limbo, with correspondence unanswered, delays, false promises and an independent project manager withdrawn.  This is simply not good enough.  There needs to be systemic reform of the SEAI to ensure confidence because we need an effective retrofit plan to help reduce emissions and deliver wider social and economic benefits.  That is not the experience of the Conroy family, who want back into their home rather than to be facing their third Christmas out of it.  Today there is no start date, contract or signed grant agreement, meaning that the estimated completion date of February 2023, which simply cannot be met without a signed grant agreement, is not confirmed.<\/p>  <p>  The litany of failures in this case is matched only by the litany of broken promises and deadlines.  Where is the oversight and accountability?  This is happening with the full knowledge of the Government.  The lack of intervention is utterly astounding and should not be tolerated.  I ask the Minister to take a more proactive step.  Will he come to Mullingar and see for himself the impact the SEAI's delays and the effect that dealing with a cowboy builder who leaves a house in tatters has on a family?

Over the years, there was a great expansion of areas such as Ballymun, Finglas, Santry, Whitehall, Glasnevin and Meakstown.  These areas saw substantial growth in housing estates, which contributed towards rapid growth in the population of north Dublin.  Many older houses in such areas were constructed of brick or cavity blocks, and insulation was not even a consideration at the time of their construction.  Houses these days are generally built to a high energy standard and require little work, if any, to improve their energy efficiency.  Older houses, be they private residences or council owned, are the houses in most need of retrofitting.  Their method of construction results in excessive heat loss through the walls and roofs; therefore, heating the house is both inefficient and costly to the resident.  There is an urgent need for old housing stock to be brought up to a satisfactory building energy rating, BER, of at least B2.  These houses will require a deep retrofit to bring them up to an acceptable energy standard.<\/p>  <p>  Studies have shown that Irish households consume more energy per household than the EU average.  This is a direct result of a poor standard of construction that leads to poor energy efficiency.  Retrofitting will result in improved energy efficiency and lower energy bills, which is becoming an important consideration in the face of escalating domestic fuel, gas and electricity bills.  However, the rising cost of living means that many households on low incomes and people with privately owned homes will be less likely to be able to afford retrofitting.  In particular, a cohort of homeowners are stuck between not qualifying for free upgrades and not being able to make use of the 50% matching grant support as they would not be able to afford it.  Renters can also be adversely affected as many face high energy bills because some landlords do not upgrade their properties or are unwilling to incur the costs associated with retrofitting.  No protections are in place for such circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight an inefficiency with the retrofitting programme itself.  It is ridiculous that the funding for the retrofitting works programme for Dublin city will stop in October and will not resume in April, resulting in months lost waiting on next year's scheme.  It also means that contractors can be left without confirmation of future contracts, and the council can ill afford to lose such experienced workers.<\/p>  <p>  There must be more joined-up thinking when councils are working in an area.  There are cases where a row of terraced houses gets wraparound insulation but a single house in the middle does not because the residents had bought their property from the council.

The Government is keenly aware of the growing pressures this is placing on families and businesses, particularly households on lower and middle incomes.  The increasing cost of energy is an issue that affects not just Ireland but all EU member states.  Increased international gas prices because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have had a serious knock-on effect on the rate of energy poverty.  The Russian Government is doing its best to use energy prices as a weapon against EU citizens, particularly the most vulnerable.  Making people cold and turning them against governments is their precise desired outcome.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative that the Opposition and all parties here focus on issues the Government can address and what needs to be done.  I will outline what we have done and what supports are in place for retrofitting, so that it is crystal clear what supports are available to homeowners.  As Members will be aware, in response to this situation, the Government has already put a &euro;2.4 billion package of support policies and measures in place.  We understand that further action will be needed, and this will be forthcoming in the budget announcements next week.  Given that energy poverty is influenced not only by the cost of energy and a person's income but also by the energy efficiency of his or her home, I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a statement to the House about the measures introduced by the Government which will make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades.<\/p>  <p>  First, in response to the war in Ukraine, we increased the grant aid for attic insulation to 80% of the typical cost, with up to &euro;1,500 available in grant support.  The data is not conclusive, but between one third and one half of homes could benefit significantly from this measure.  This will likely pay back in less than one year, and I understand credit unions and banks are supporting people if they need to bridge the gap.  Similarly, for cavity wall insulation, up to 80% of the cost, up to &euro;1,700, is available to help householders.  We are seeing more uptake to the end of August than in the whole of last year.  The SEAI has said that it had the busiest start to a winter ever.  We are seeing a large increase in the interest in and application of solar PV on people's roofs.  We have a target of less than 19,000 individual home upgrades this year, and we will deliver in excess of that target.  We also opened this scheme to landlords to stimulate their investing in homes because those in the rental sector must also be protected.<\/p>  <p>  Second, we have more than doubled the monthly output of the warmer homes scheme.  However, it is still working through the backlog that built up during Covid.  We are targeting a significant increase next year and, in line with the national development plan and with the receipts from the carbon tax that fund this, we must increase it significantly as it is a critical measure.  In February, we announced reforms to the better energy warmer homes scheme so that it could better target free energy upgrades for those most in need.  Since the announcement, the scheme now accepts applications from homeowners who previously had work done under the scheme so that they can benefit from the deeper measures now available.  The eligibility criteria for the scheme were also extended to encompass people who have been in receipt of disability allowance for over six months and have a child under seven years of age.  In addition, the scheme is now targeting the worst performing properties by prioritising homes built and occupied before January 1993 and with a BER of E, F or G.  This scheme is working.  The output has tripled.  As is the case with so many other schemes, the level of response from the public and the industry is beyond compare, and it will continue to rise as we go into next year and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  The third element of our retrofit plan is the national retrofit scheme, which launched in February and went live in April.  This seeks to support homeowners by delivering deeper, decarbonisation measures.  It hit a chord with homeowners with more than 20,000 people already engaging with one-stop shops.  This programme is a long-term plan and is designed to build competence and capacity over time.  It is a 30-year project.  We will not reach the maximum of this scheme in one year; it will take five years of steady growth and good planning.  Having spoken to those in the industry, I am aware that they are investing in new employees, training and hardware, and are rapidly scaling up their industrial capabilities.  This was never possible before because there was much stop-starting in the support given in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  The national retrofit plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key pillars: to drive demand and activity; to provide financing and funding; to improve supply chain, skills and standards; and to improve the governance of the scheme.  Barriers were identified for each pillar, and time-bound policies, measures and actions were put in place to address them.  The initiatives in the plan are also guided by a number of key principles.  First, we are seeking to ensure fairness to all and support a just transition.  Second, we seek to embrace a universal approach covering all housing types and consumer segments.  Third, we seek to design customer-centric solutions to reduce the costs and complexity, making the process easier for those investing in retrofitting.  Fourth, we are seeking to encourage retrofits to cost-optimal level and maximise emission abatement.  Finally, we seek to stimulate and support the market to instil the confidence to invest, grow and take on more workers.  We are now delivering that for the betterment of the people.<\/p>  <p>  A further element of the plan is how we work with local authorities and approved housing bodies.  This last plank in our retrofitting plan is critical.  I have been to many local authorities around the country, asking them what they are doing and making sure they are scaling up their capacity and competency to deliver higher targets.<\/p> <p>We have also underpinned the upgrades in the rental sector with opening all these grants to landlords to upgrade properties for tenants.  In addition, as part of Housing for All, the Minister with responsibility for housing has detailed that these retrofits will become compulsory for lower-performing homes in the coming years.<\/p> <p> I am happy to report that SEAI data shows that since the launch of these new measures, demand across the retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high.  As of the end of last month, more than 30,000 applications for support had been received by SEAI.  This is more than double the number received during the same period last year.  This demand is translating into delivery, with 13,400 home energy upgrades already completed with support from across the range of schemes.  This is an increase of 70% when compared to the same period last year.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smith, will give further detail on these positive developments in his closing statement.<\/p> <p> These initiatives are being funded by the unprecedented national development plan financial allocation for residential retrofit of &euro;8 billion to 2030.  A total of &euro;5 billion of this funding will be sourced from carbon tax revenue.  A total of &euro;244 million has been allocated for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and the solar PV scheme this year.  This is the highest ever allocation for the schemes and includes an allocation of &euro;118 million for SEAI energy poverty schemes.  In addition, &euro;85 million funding has been provided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the local authority energy efficiency retrofit programme.  This means that of the total Government retrofit budget allocation of &euro;329 million, approximately 60%, or &euro;203 million, has been allocated to dedicated energy poverty schemes and local authority retrofits.  This is progressive.  We are deliberately targeting and making sure that the money goes where it is most needed.  This does not mean we do not provide, help and assist other parts of Irish society.  We are doing this in a balanced and deliberately strategic way.<\/p> <p> On 3 August, the Department published a review of the strategy to combat energy poverty alongside a public consultation.  The review showed strong delivery on the existing strategy with many of the original actions already exceeded.  The public consultation closed on 5 September and the responses received are helping to inform the development of a new action plan to combat energy poverty.  Other sectoral engagement across Government will also be considered in developing the new action plan.<\/p> <p> The action plan will set out a range of measures to be implemented ahead of the coming winter as well as key longer-term measures to ensure that those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected.  The new plan will be published shortly after the budget.  A cross-departmental steering group, chaired by the Department, is developing the new action plan.  The Department is also engaging with relevant Departments, agencies and NGOs on a bilateral basis.  The group will also work with the ESRI as part of a research network to improve the measurement and monitoring of energy poverty in Ireland and provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable householders.<\/p> <p> These retrofit schemes are recognised internationally as some of the best examples and as some of the best funded and most progressive.  We will never be satisfied because it will never be enough in these exceptional times.  These plans are working.  The Irish people are responding.  We are starting to put in PV and insulation at levels never seen before and we are only warming up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000034#GG00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663696200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The debate is taking place in the midst of a massive rise in the cost of living.  I urge people to attend the protest on Saturday, 24 September, at the Garden of Remembrance at 2 p.m.  It will be one of the biggest protest marches we have seen in a long time.<\/p>  <p>  The existing national retrofitting plan has two distinct streams.  These are the better energy warmer homes scheme, which aims to provide free retrofits to those on certain social welfare payments, and the one-stop-shop service that requires households to have significant savings on hand to invest in retrofitting.  For everyone else in between there is little or no support for upgrading the BER standard of their homes.  This leaves them living in colder homes with mounting energy bills.  We need to change this.  Many households do not qualify for free upgrades and many do not have the cash needed to avail of the 50% matched grant support.  The Government's plan excludes too many households.<\/p>  <p>  What would Sinn F&eacute;in do?  We would replace the better energy warmer homes scheme with a new retrofit scheme for low and middle income households including area-based components for deep retrofits.  Among other measures, households could be eligible for various levels of funding from between 100% to 65% of the cost of retrofits depending on household income.  We would increase funding for local authority retrofits.  As always, the most disadvantaged are those who suffer the most and have to await local authorities.  It is important that local authorities are given enough funding to ensure all the homes they rent are retrofitted.  We would establish a new retrofit scheme for solid fuel homes under which households could be eligible for various levels of funding up to 100%.  We would replace the one-stop-shop with tiered support for higher-income households.  The scaled-down one-stop-shop scheme would continue but with the State's support tiered based on household income.  Under this scheme households may be eligible for 50% to 100% of funding towards the cost of retrofits.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes increasing the retrofitting budget to a total of &euro;500 million next year.  This would be a 50% increase in funding compared to this year.  However, we will not just increase funding.

I hope to see thousands of people on the streets of Dublin on Saturday.  The cost of food has increased, as have the costs of energy, renting and home ownership.  With a view to energy saving and reducing our energy consumption, retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient is a positive idea but it must be offered at an affordable rate to all households.  We cannot exclude anybody.  The better energy warmer homes scheme is not working for many of those who have applied.  A total of 9,000 homes await the works, with a wait time of up to 27 months in some cases.  It is not working for those on lower incomes who simply cannot apply as they are not on the specific social welfare payment.  Those in local authority homes are not benefiting with only 1,584 local authority homes retrofitted in 2021.  It will not happen for those waiting for the local authorities to do a retrofit.  Those of us who have been members of local authorities know exactly what they will do.<\/p>  <p>  The one-stop-shop scheme is beyond the affordability of many citizens who simply do not have the savings to commit to retrofitting.  Expanding this and, importantly, delivering a progressive retrofit plan is a necessity.  It will deliver social and economic benefits for citizens while helping us to meet our emissions reduction targets.<\/p>  <p>  The motion sensibly calls for orientation of the retrofit plan towards those who have the greatest need for retrofit.  These are those most severely impacted by energy price increases.  Our proposal calls for an assessment of household income as a means of deciding what percentage of the retrofit is covered.  The area-based approach in our proposed scheme would allow for homes in close proximity to be retrofitted at the same time, delivering savings and lowering costs.  It is nonsensical to have some homes in an area covered and others not.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Limerick regeneration programme a commitment was made to retrofit houses in the four regeneration areas.  The 2014 regeneration implementation plan committed &euro;4.7 million to retrofitting homes in these areas.  Unfortunately, here we are almost ten years later seeing no rhyme nor reason.  Some houses have been done but others on the street have not while others have been skipped or excluded.  I do not have faith in it.<\/p>  <p>  A failure to deliver will condemn more of our vulnerable citizens to the unenviable choice of deciding whether to heat their homes or use that income for other vital needs.

I can tell him the residents in the flat complexes have been forgotten about and they are freezing and terrified.  The condition of the vast majority of flats is very bad.  Dampness and mould as a result of poor insulation is rife in many flats.  The flats in Mercer House, Pearse Street, Whelan House, Rathmines and many council-owned houses are in a disgraceful condition.  Glover Court, as the Minister knows, was supposed to be retrofitted many years ago but, like many plans for the flat complexes, it never happened.  In 2022 the flat complexes are like wind tunnels given the unacceptable condition of the doors.<\/p> <p>One could fit one's hand through many of the old wooden doors that are basically unusable and then the windows are rattling and creating a wind tunnel.

There seems to be an attitude that the flats do not matter - that they will be last and we will get around to them at the end.

We are also in the midst of the biggest energy crisis we have faced in a generation with home energy and fuel costs going through the roof as we head into winter.  The Government's totally inadequate retrofitting schemes are compounding the energy crisis.  More than 9,000 households are waiting on works under the better energy warmer homes schemes, with a wait of well over two years.  Just over 1,500 council houses were retrofitted last year.<\/p>  <p>  The one-stop shop service gives the same grant funding to those who earn the minimum wage as it does to millionaires.  It is galling that as low- and middle-income households face into frightening energy bill increases, high earners who can afford to install solar panels and are therefore eligible for grant aid will not be affected.  Indeed, they might make some money by selling it back to the grid.  As usual, it is the ordinary working people who are completely excluded.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's plan would introduce a new retrofit scheme for low- and middle-income households.  Our system would be tiered to ensure that different levels of household income receive a proportionate grant from 100% down to 65%.  We would also increase funding for local authority retrofits by 50%.  We would bring in a solid fuel retrofitting scheme for those who rely on burning wood, turf or coal to heat their homes.  We would also help these households to insulate their homes and install heat pumps, with the priority being to change the fuel source.  Our approach can be compared with the Government's attempts to ban turf and slap carbon taxes on people without giving them any alternative or choice.  We would introduce area-based components to our scheme to see houses in close proximity retrofitted at the same time to reduce costs and building time.  The way the scheme is managed at present is impractical and does not make the best use of resources.  The Government's scheme prioritises those who have the most over those who have the greatest need.  It excludes most middle-income households - those who do not qualify for free upgrades but do not have tens of thousands of euros to spare to access the one-stop shop scheme.  Our scheme will address these issues.  It will help households to become more energy efficient, saving them money in the long term.  It will help us to reduce our emission targets and, most importantly, it is fair and equitable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000036#JJ00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1663696800,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Retrofitting is the low-hanging fruit with regard to reaching the State's emission targets and future-proofing energy security.  As the Minister will be aware, in 2017 the built environment alone accounted for 12.7% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  To put this into context, the average Irish dwelling emits 104% more than the EU average.  This is not a record we can be proud of.  This has come about not only as a result of our reliance on more carbon-intensive fuels, but also due to the poor quality of insulation in our homes, which is another legacy of the Celtic tiger, cowboy builder era.  It can also be attributed to a failure, in more general terms, to upgrade older housing stock over the years.  As it stands, more than 80% of Irish homes and other buildings have a BER of C or worse.  This is an astonishing figure.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that 70% of current buildings will still be in use by 2050.  Even if every new building and home were to be carbon neutral, this would not be sufficient to meet our targets, such is the number of properties with poor energy ratings.  If we are to build a carbon-neutral Ireland, we will need nothing short of a massive State-led retrofitting programme over the next decade.  Frankly, there is little sign of this.  There is no real sense of a national campaign.  There are bits and pieces here and there - a piecemeal approach - but no indication of a national town-by-town and street-by-street effort.  The lack of such an effort was baffling a year ago and it is even more puzzling now, given what energy-impoverished households are facing into this winter.  We need a national effort and campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from the urgent need to retrofit homes from a climate perspective, there is a double imperative with the current cost-of-living crisis.  We know that energy prices are only going one direction, which is up.  Reducing our consumption of energy on a household, business and national level will be key to helping to bring bills back down.  Home insulation can be a win-win.  Deep retrofitting has the dual impact of lowering emissions and reducing energy bills for households.  It also creates good sustainable green jobs in our communities.  It is a no-brainer of a policy which one would think the Government would be absolutely eager to adopt and embrace, as it would be the kind of real national campaign that the challenge we are facing demands.<\/p>  <p>  One would think that the kitchen sink would be thrown at this but experience tells us that has not been the case to date.  The energy-efficiency retrofit budget for local authority housing was a mere &euro;85 million in 2022.  This clearly is not the overwhelming national priority that it ought to be.  Based on an average cost of &euro;36,000 per unit, an extra &euro;100 million would be required to ensure 5,000 homes are progressed next year.  When some construction inflation is factored in, the package would probably need to be brought up to close to double that, or approximately &euro;185 million.  This should be the absolute bare minimum that we need to hear from the Government on budget day.  Even that would not go anywhere near the scale of the ambition required, and nor would it go far enough fast enough.  In contrast, my party has proposed how 100,000 homes could and should be retrofitted on a street-by-street basis each year.  That is at least the level of ambition we need.<\/p>  <p>  We know that cost is a major barrier to undertaking retrofitting work, as others have articulated during the course of this debate.  While the national energy upgrade scheme now offers grants of up to 50% to 80%, this is no good to most working families who just simply cannot afford the initial upfront payment and all that involves.  As it stands, they are struggling to make ends meet, with soaring prices and stagnant wages.  They simply do not have &euro;10,000 or &euro;25,000 in savings to carry out a deep retrofit under some of the current schemes.  Put simply, they are stuck between a rock and a hard place.  They earn too much for the warmer homes scheme but not enough to afford major upgrades.  They do not have the means to fork out the high cost that grants such as the one-stop shop schemes require.  In the meantime, their gas and electricity bills continue to rise out of control.  Too many households like this across the country are experiencing energy poverty but are excluded from free energy upgrades.  It creates a lose-lose situation out of what really should be a win-win situation.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, the Labour Party is calling for a retrofitting programme targeted at those households earning under &euro;50,000 and with a BER of B2 or below.  We are also calling for a form of carbon credit, through the tax system, to help working families that do not qualify for most supports such as fuel allowance and the household benefits package.  We also need to be conscious of other groups in the design of retrofitting and energy-saving schemes.  This winter, energy prices for homes which are old and protected will be hit with extortionate energy bills.  Homes such as these are excluded from retrofitting incentives and adequate fuel supports should be targeted at them.  Likewise, there will be many people living in rented homes where the landlord is unwilling to apply to the one-stop shop for the various schemes.  It is unfair that such people should have to face an effective rent increase due to the rising cost of paying for their fuel and energy bills.  Those living in older apartment developments with managing companies that are uninterested in retrofitting require imaginative support too.  The chronic apartment defects issues highlighted over recent years require support.<\/p> <p>People who are experiencing those problems require additional support and we are looking forward, in the context of the budget, to see what the Government has in mind for that cohort of people.  The mistakes of the past should not be repeated and a more proactive approach by the State will be needed in such cases.<\/p> <p> We also need to see a faster, simpler and more streamlined application process for the various Government supports and grants.  The current application process is too slow, too complex and too costly.  That has been my experience when advocating for people in Louth and east Meath.  The so-called one stop shop often consists in reality of visiting many other shops along the way until you conclude the process.  As the Climate Change Advisory Council has noted, this red tape must be simplified urgently to assist consumers through the renewable energy process.<\/p> <p> Finally, the elephant in the room is the lack of the apprentices and skilled workers needed to deliver the kind of change the climate challenge requires us to see.  They are often forgotten from the conversation but without them none of these targets will be achieved; not today, not next year - never.  One recent report has stated more than 50,000 construction workers are urgently needed to fill a black hole in the workforce if the State is to meet its housing and retrofitting targets.  The Government has set its own target of just 27,500 additional construction sector workers over five years.  That breaks down at 7,500 each year.  In this context, last month's Core Research report for the construction industry is deeply worrying.  It showed 63% of construction companies were struggling to find workers with 46% of industry professionals noting plasterers are rare and very difficult to find, as are carpenters.  This is contributing to significant inflation in the cost of construction work and major delays for all kinds of construction projects, be they national, local, regional or simply domestic.  Part of the reason for this is the precarious conditions in the construction sector.  With the starting rate of pay for apprentices often being half the minimum wage, who could blame our young people for opting out?  Let us not pretend we can have a functioning, fit-for-purpose, skilled construction sector while it continues to be so dependent on labour that is to a very large extent dominated by the phenomenon of bogus self-employment.  If retrofitting at scale is to become a reality, which is a reality I think all in the House want to see, we will need to see an urgent increase in pay for apprentices to at least parity with the minimum wage in the first year and a sea change in the approach to security of employment in the sector if we are to have the skilled workers to service the ambitions of the retrofitting and housebuilding programme across the country over the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000036#JJ00300","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663697400,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this important issue.  It emphasises very clearly how inaccessible retrofitting is for many households around the country and certainly for those who need it most.<\/p>  <p>  Gas and electricity bills are already crippling and as temperatures start to drop as we get closer to winter, more and more families will be forced to choose between keeping the house warm or putting food on the table.  That is a dehumanising decision nobody should have to make but is one thousands across Ireland will have to because of the Government's failure to provide adequate supports for low and middle-income households throughout the country.  Retrofitting homes is no longer a matter of urgency but a matter of basic necessity for many.  For many people, the State has left it too late and they will have to endure a winter of record energy prices and if they cannot afford them they will have to choose between living in a cold, dark room or sacrificing other necessities.  That is not hyperbole on my part, as those figures are captured by a multitude of different organisations, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It was also captured by Social Justice Ireland.  It demonstrated earlier this year that 581,334 people are living in poverty in this country.  They were already people who were choosing to go without food so their children did not have to, which is a choice nobody should have to make.  These are families who did not have access to two warm coats and who did not have money left over at the end to have a basic thing like a night out with a friend.  These are the families who are going to need it most.  These are the vulnerable people who feel these shortcomings most.  The shortcomings will be felt by families already experiencing poverty, including one-parent households, migrant families and all those already living on the margins.  Estimates show that almost half of households could now be in energy poverty.  That is only set to get worse with more price hikes coming into effect in the next few weeks.  For people to pay any more than they already are is simply unimaginable.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's inaction may have failed many this winter but we cannot sit idly by and find ourselves in the same circumstances for the next one.  Earlier this year the engineer in charge of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s retrofit programme said it would take 12 years to complete the retrofitting of the city&rsquo;s social homes at current funding levels.  That is completely unacceptable.  Where else did we hear about 12 years?  How many of us, the Green Party included, went out three years ago and campaigned to an electorate based on it being 12 years until a point of no return for climate change and biodiversity loss?  We said we would demonstrate urgency yet a Dublin City Council official is telling us it will be 12 years before we can enact a retrofitting programme.  That is not acceptable by any measure.  This needs to be addressed by doubling the retrofitting grant in the budget next week.  Bringing up a home&rsquo;s energy rating is a huge financial undertaking, even with the help of the SEAI&rsquo;s current grants and so we must see adequate investment in next week&rsquo;s budget.  However, grants alone are not enough to ensure energy security for all those who are struggling.  Low-interest loans should be made available for households that still require them to complete their retrofit as too many households have been priced out of the scheme.  As well as providing adequate grants and affordable loans for all those who need them, we need to see an investment in training and retraining programmes to build a workforce large enough to retrofit homes as soon as possible.  All the funding in the world means nothing if there are no workers to complete the upgrades and that this has not been factored in is a sad indictment of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Just as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation next winter where households are still facing a crisis, it is crucial we do not fall short of our climate action targets in 2030.  We cannot put off reducing our carbon emissions.  This leaves us with not one but two vital reasons to retrofit properties around the country as quickly as possible.  We simply cannot separate the cost-of-living crisis from the climate crisis.  The Government has set a target of retrofitting 5,000 homes by 2030 but as my colleague Deputy Whitmore said, and I agree, there is little clarity on how this can be achieved and we need to see genuine commitment and a realistic plan to achieve these goals in writing in next week&rsquo;s budget.  As energy companies rake in profits from this broken market while families find themselves in crisis, we must also see a substantial windfall tax to reroute those profits to speed up retrofits for the households that directly need it.  People woke up last week and saw the ESB had made &euro;1.5 billion more than it did this time last year.  Imagine seeing that while wondering how many pairs of jumpers you will have to wear not to be freezing in the cold winter months ahead.  We are in a crisis and need a response that is in keeping with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000037#KK00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1663697400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for this motion, which we fully support.<\/p>  <p>  Retrofitting is a key solution to two crises, namely, the climate crisis and the energy crisis but for us the latter is the immediate one.  I will deal with the climate crisis in a minute but first I want to give an account of two homes I visited recently.  They were two council-owned homes that were retrofitted to a high BER.  One family is very poor with two special needs kids.  You walk in the door and the house is warm even though they have not turned on the heating in months.  They used to live off a pay-as-you-go card and were spending &euro;60 a week on trying to just keep the heat in the house for the kids.  Now they probably spend about &euro;20 in the winter months, so it is a no-brainer.  They are not lighting fires, the kids are warm and cosy and the bills are brought right down, particularly in this energy crisis.  Another family got a proper retrofit with wraparound insulation, having the walls lined, having the attic properly lagged and getting new windows and doors.  They are amazed at how warm the house is, as was I, and they never have to turn on the heating.<\/p>  <p>  Retrofitting is therefore a no-brainer but there are huge problems with the current experience.  People who were refused the fuel allowance are unable to access the SEAI schemes in most cases.  However, if you are better off &ndash; it is important to emphasise this &ndash; and you have, for example, &euro;50,000 to put upfront, you can access a very nice retrofitting scheme for your home, whereas the bulk of the other grants are small and piecemeal.<\/p>  <p>  The big question for the Minister of State as a member of the Green Party is what do the current schemes to reduce emissions.  We have some worrying complaints from people about the nature of the work being done and its effectiveness.  There is little point in doing small, energy-efficiency work if it still leaves a home reliant on fossil fuel and does not actually reduce the CO2 emissions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's inaction may have failed many this winter but we cannot sit idly by and find ourselves in the same circumstances for the next one.  Earlier this year, Dublin City Council's engineer in charge of its retrofit programme said it would take 12 years to complete the retrofitting of the city's social homes at current funding levels, which is completely unacceptable.  Where else did we hear about 12 years?  How many of us, including the Green Party, went out three years ago and campaigned to an electio based on <\/p> <p>What we truly need is a national retrofit body, a company that is fully owned and run by the State, that does what has been described previously, namely trains loads of apprentices, and does not leave the provision of the work to a private company or run the risk that we will not lift people out of energy poverty or reduce emissions.  A national retrofit body to directly employ workers and direct the scale and pace of the retrofitting by Government is needed.<br\/><br\/>The Government constantly talks about the &euro;8 billion it is putting into retrofitting along with targets of 500,000 homes to be deep retrofitted and 400,000 heat pumps.  This target was presented as a great achievement of the Green Party but it is precisely what was in the 2019 climate plan.  There are several problems with this &euro;8 billion figure.  It is clear from the answers I received to earlier questions that this sum is heavily back-loaded to the latter years of 2028, 2029 and 2030.  Just like our emissions targets, a lot is based on a <i>ma&ntilde;ana<\/i>, <i>ma&ntilde;ana<\/i>approach.  It is planned we will spend &euro;1.2 billion in 2028, &euro;1.7 billion in 2029 and &euro;2 billion in 2030.  The problem is, of course, that according to the current trends, we will not reach those targets.  Like emissions reductions, the Government's ambitions to achieve these targets may mean it and the current Minister of State will be out of office.  We know that just ten homes had a deep retrofit last year and up to May this year it seemed that none had been fully completed.  This comes on top of ongoing delays and problems facing people getting access to work on their homes that was previously done.  I was told months ago that the no second visit rule was gone from the SEAI rules.  It is not really gone.  People must apply for a scheme that is organised by the one-stop shop or the better energy warmer homes scheme and, therefore, they have to fulfil the criteria of one of them to be in a position to apply for a deep retrofit.  The vast majority will not fit into these categories.  Other supports for individual upgrades like the attic, wall insulation, heat pumps and so on will not be supported by the SEAI if any work was previously done on the home in question.  It may even have been done by a previous owner many years before and anyone seeking support now will be refused.  That is just one example of where we are failing in this area.<br\/><br\/>Another example is people on the median wage who are not on social protection and are not well off.  A single parent with two children who came to me during the week is being asked for &euro;15,000 upfront to have the wraparound done on her home.  That is not right and that is totally unfair.  She can barely even raise the money to get the kids back to school even though she works full time.  There is a clear class bias in the distribution of the supports.  It is striking and I know there was great work done under the better energy warmer homes scheme but the reality is that the vast majority are not included and will not get access to this.  The vast majority of homes that desperately need the retrofitting are, therefore, not benefiting from it.  <br\/><br\/>&quot;Glacial pace&quot; may be the wrong term to use since the glaciers are melting at a rate of knots, but the slow pace of the social housing stock retrofitting is painful.  It seems we are less ambitious now and are achieving less than we did in previous years.  For example, the State spent &euro;30 million on local authority retrofits in 2014 and retrofitted 18,000 homes.  Last year, it spent &euro;21 million and retrofitted just 1,500 homes.  I see the targets but we do not see the real delivery or the ambition given the scale of the twin crises of energy and climate.  We need to cut our energy demand and our CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.  I do not accept the argument that it takes time to ramp up delivery.  The logic here is that we must send signals to the market and hope that the market will deliver the numbers needed in retrofitted homes, workers and the resources to be allocated.  If we have learned any lesson from the current crisis, it must be that leaving something as vital and important as energy and heating homes to the market is a recipe for disaster.  This points to the vital need for a public body to take responsibility for retrofitting and for achieving the scale and pace of the work needed, and ensuring that we can recruit and train the workers needed.  This cannot be left to the market and private companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000037#KK00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663698000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the retrofitting scheme and how it can help with the spiralling cost of living, which is the biggest concern of my constituents at present.  People are being crucified by inflation and electricity prices 89% above the EU average.  This is completely unsustainable.  If the Government refuses to cap electricity prices and get on top of the situation now, thousands of households will be facing into an extremely worrying and uncertain winter.  Time is of the essence if the most vulnerable people across Ireland are to receive timely assistance.  The ESRI estimates that more than 40% of people will be in energy poverty this winter.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to prices, vulnerable constituents and housing poverty, my constituency office is acutely aware that the people of County Louth and east Meath simply cannot afford to retrofit their energy-inefficient homes.  We well know that poorly insulated homes require more energy to heat which will result in increasing carbon emissions and even higher energy bills for households.  I would not say that the Government has done nothing but it needs to do more.  Currently more than 9,000 homes await work under the better energy warmer homes scheme, with a waiting time of 27 months, which is shocking.  Recently I had a woman in my constituency office who applied under the retrofitting scheme for a heat pump to replace her energy-inefficient oil boiler.  She met all means requirements.  Due to the backlog of applications she went ahead and paid someone to install a heat pump.  Subsequently one year later, when an assessor called to view the property, she was denied a grant as work had been done.  This needs to be changed.<\/p>  <p>  I, therefore, ask the Government to consider the immediate approval of allocations received under the national retrofitting scheme.  We need to help the people now by providing a greater investment in retrofitting households as a matter of urgency.  Not a day passes when there is not a queue in my office of people looking for help to fill in applications forms to see what is available.  However, many low- and middle-income households in my constituency of Louth and east Meath are excluded from retrofitting under the Government scheme as they do not qualify for the better energy warmer homes scheme and do not have the disposable income required to afford a deep retrofit under the one-stop shop service.  This needs to change.  State funding should be proportionally allocated on the basis of need and specifically targeted at those who rely on burning solid fuel for heat.<\/p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that the amount the Department has allocated to this grant scheme has increased each year since 2014, which is welcome.  However, we face significant challenges in meeting the targets in Housing for All and the retrofitting targets given inefficiently lengthy mean-tested grant applications and the limited throughput of apprentices in the construction sector, which is already understaffed.  The biggest problem we have in Louth and east Meath is the increase in construction costs and material and the shortage of skills and labour.  This is putting the cost of these upgrades and essential works beyond the reach of most recipients of grant approval.  It is very hard at the moment to get value for money.  In the incoming budget the Government should ensure that the grant scheme can meet the demands and reflect the increase in construction costs to meet targets for emissions reductions.  The upper limit grants should reflect the increase in the cost of construction.  If we are to tackle this issue we need to take a much more direct route.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to raise the concern that current and new housing developments in my constituency of Louth and east Meath are still installing gas lines instead of heat pumps.  These developments are going to cost us in the coming years and they will have to be replaced.  The Government must look at long-term costs and implement regulations now.  Additionally, we cannot have a situation whereby people are in energy poverty which will have subsequent effect of increasing hospital admissions, causing further stress on health service.  These least can afford this energy.  There should be a reform of the current national retrofit plan whereby the focus of funding and resources is redirected towards those in greater need of retrofitting.  We need to improve delivery times and cost efficiencies while increasing the number of retrofits, especially for those in need.  In the upcoming budget the Government must keep its promises and we must follow up the allocation of the &euro;165 million towards housing, climate change and balanced regional development.  Families need a warm home and stability.  Ireland needs a progressive and effective retrofit plan that will help our emissions reduction targets while delivering wider social and economic benefits for workers and families.  Morale in the country is very low.  Families are suffering.  The people need help now.  It has been said that either people are going to eat or heat.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to heat the people's homes and, next Tuesday, the Government has the opportunity to let people eat.  Many people are coming into my constituency office who want to avail of these schemes.  As the previous speaker said, if they had work done ten or 15 years ago, that is affecting their applications as well.  I ask the Minister of State to please have a look.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000038#LL00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1663698600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Ten years ago, in 2012, I had the opportunity to formulate a detailed and costed plan to deep retrofit 1.4 million houses in this State that were still, at the time, in need of deep insulation, in addition to the 130,000 non-residential buildings that were in the same state.  I presented the plan to the D&aacute;il.  At the time, the costings that we worked out meant that it would cost approximately &euro;14 billion to bring all of the residential housing stock up to an average BER of C1.  At the time, according to the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, &euro;10,000 per home would have saved the average household approximately &euro;1,496 per year, and it would have helped Ireland reach its 20% energy-efficient target by 2020.  It was an incredible plan that was very detailed.  We presented it to the Fine Gael Government at the time, which said, &ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo;<\/p><p>This Government launched a plan a few months ago.  If one extrapolates the figures from the Government&rsquo;s plan to do the same number of houses, it would cost approximately &euro;24 billion.  That is unlikely because of the massive spike in inflation that is happening at the moment.  However, even on the Government&rsquo;s figures, it would cost &euro;10 billion more than had the plan that I produced in 2012 been put into place.<\/p><p>One of the reasons I came up with the retrofitting plan was that there was a massive flow of construction workers emigrating from the State.  Many of them just could not find work here.  I believed that if we involved them in a significant retrofit scheme, we would be able to achieve energy efficiency, save money for families and keep workers in Ireland.  Unfortunately, again, Fine Gael, not caring much about our workers, sent tens of thousands of those construction workers away to other countries to start new lives.  As a result, many of the construction workers we need now to deal with the housing crisis are simply not there.  It was a massive mistake and a lack of foresight on the Government&rsquo;s behalf in three separate, objective areas.  <\/p><p>Common sense dictates that the barrel of oil that is cheapest at the moment is the barrel of oil that you do not burn.  Most families understand that saving energy is probably the most important objective we have.  It is a higher priority even than the generation of sustainable electricity and, therefore, it is frustrating to see how little progress has been achieved so far.  I am not laying all the blame on the Green Party, because the Green Party is two years in this particular Government and I understand it takes time.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have dressed themselves up in greenwashing over the past ten years but delivered absolutely zero in terms of retrofitting.  The figures are incredibly low.  Over the past two years, the figures have decreased in certain areas.  Indeed, the figures for 2020 were 25% below target and last year&rsquo;s were also extremely low.  Projects literally stopping and stalling is frustrating to see.<\/p><p>The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>did a wonderful report a couple of weeks ago.  The Minister of State must have looked at it and perhaps blushed when he read it.  It showed that thousands of public buildings are scoring as low as F and G for energy efficiency.  They say charity starts at home, but certainly policy should start with the Government first and foremost.  Yet, the Government is not doing its job in terms of retrofitting its own buildings.  It is an absolute bloody disgrace that there are thousands of State buildings in this country that have F and G ratings, which are nearly impossible to heat and cost massive money to run.  It is not by accident as well.  We have senior public servants in this country who are happy to spend money without accountability.  Why?  Because it is not their money.  The best type of money is other people&rsquo;s money, in fairness, if one is going to spend money.  That is one of the problems.  This type of inefficiency would not be acceptable in people&rsquo;s homes or businesses as well.  <\/p><p>I will give another example.  There are public buildings in my constituency, for example, a Department of Justice building, that is lit up every night like Las Vegas.  It is incredible.  It is lit up massively for no practical purpose &ndash; just for aesthetics.  It is still happening.  When one sees that level of inefficiency in State buildings and Ministers calling for lights to be turned off at night-time and for staff to be concentrated on one floor, jaws drop across the country.  Most people cannot believe it has not happened already.  Most people cannot believe we have attacked the earnings and incomes of farmers before we have even decided to turn off the lights in public buildings at night-time.<\/p><p>I urge the Government to get real on retrofitting and saving energy and make sure that we make buildings warmer and cost less to heat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000039#MM00100","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1663698600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I support the motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.

However, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n gave the appalling example of State buildings to show that the Government and public bodies do not give a whim about saving energy and retrofitting, for that matter.  There is no such thing as retrofitting.  The schemes are too onerous.  There is a massive waiting list, not enough money and people have to invest a lot to get a report done beforehand.  As far as I can see, the schemes are tailor-made for the leafy suburbs of Dublin.  I mean the leafy suburbs and not the ordinary lads out in Jobstown, Tallaght or any place else.  It is the people in the leafy suburbs of south Dublin.  That is where the schemes are suited because they have the money to put up.  They are the ones with the electric cars too.  They are the ones who are dictating Government policy.<\/p>  <p>  I said to the Ceann Comhairle before that Irish people were living in eco-friendly houses long before the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was &ndash; I will not repeat it &ndash; ever born.

It is time the Government parties got some measure or modicum of reality, as well as a bit of humility, and brought the people with them.  They should lead by example and bring the people with them.  There is not near enough funding for this.  The Government penalises farmers&rsquo; groups and the working man.

The funny thing is, if we go back 15, 16 or 17 years to when the Government rolled out the scheme initially and it was done through community alert schemes, it delivered.  I was on the community alert scheme at the time; I was not a politician.  It delivered door to door and it got attics insulated.  Unfortunately, funds are not there to do a proper insulation package for houses today.  The people who got that little bit of insulation that time are punished today because the current scheme makes sure that they cannot now get their homes insulated because they got a little bit of insulation perhaps 15 or 20 years ago.  This scheme is completely outdated and does not work.  People who want to get their homes retrofitted are waiting two years, which is far too long.

The latest figures for fuel poverty seem to be from 2017.  At the time, it was estimated that 475,000 households were affected by fuel poverty or, in other words, had to spend 10% of their income on heating their home.  There is no up-to-date strategy to deal with fuel poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The retrofitting of homes has to be a key element of combating fuel poverty by making homes easier to heat and cutting energy bills.  It is also a key factor in meeting the State's climate change targets.  It has been estimated that retrofitting all homes would decrease carbon emissions by 22%.  However, the current retrofitting schemes are simply not up to the job.  The cost of a deep retrofit for an average three-bedroom house is between &euro;60,000 and &euro;70,000, or more.  A deep retrofit involves insulating attics and cavity walls and installing heat pumps to bring a house up to a B2 rating.  The grant amount of &euro;25,000 means that a householder would have to borrow between &euro;35,000 and &euro;45,000, which is beyond the means of most individuals.  In effect, the better energy warmer homes scheme means those who cannot afford it are subsidising those who can.  That is why I am opposed to the carbon tax.  It is inequitable from the point of view of those who need it most.<\/p>  <p>  Most Deputies received an email from a man in County Cork who had listened to Dr. Ciaran Byrne, the director of national retrofit for the SEAI, being interviewed on a radio programme and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, being interviewed on the same programme shortly afterwards.  The man states that he lives in a three-bedroom detached bungalow in west Cork.  The house was built in 1980 and has a BER of D1.  He wishes to deeply retrofit his home and, having done lots of research, hired an independent energy assessor from a company that does whole-house retrofit plans.  The estimated cost for the deep retrofit drawn up by the energy assessor was &euro;59,300.  After the national housing retrofit scheme, NHRS, grant, the final cost to him would be &euro;30,600, which he can just about afford.  After the independent assessment, he contacted every one-stop shop listed on the SEAI website.  He got a shock when the estimated quotes for the work started to come through.  He attached to the email a selection of the quotes he received.  One is for &euro;92,400.  After the grant, that would leave him with &euro;60,000 to pay.  Another came in at &euro;108,700.  His heart sank as quotes started to come in and he realised there was no way he could possibly afford this.  When he heard Mr. Byrne expressing surprise at quotes as big as those and then later, in a separate interview, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, stating that no one in her constituency had complained to her about the cost of deep retrofits, he was really frustrated and left with the feeling that he cannot afford the retrofit.<\/p>  <p>  That is the reality of what is going on in a lot of instances in the context of the schemes.  The scheme needs to be reformed and reorientated towards those most in need.  There needs to be funding for the retrofitting of local authority houses and the homes of those on social welfare, for example.  Dublin City Council has retrofitted fewer than 900 homes in almost four years, with the average BER improved only from an F rating to a C1 rating.  Those homes will probably need to be redone in future to bring them up to a B2 rating.  Dublin City Council's target is to retrofit just 225 homes a year.  On that basis, it will take 14 years to do the 2,800 homes remaining and 1,700 units will be left with below standard upgrades.  There needs to be an increase in funding for local authorities to dramatically increase their targets and there needs to be oversight to ensure that proper standards are met.  There should be increased funding to older people and those on welfare, while a new scheme to make retrofitting accessible to those on lower wages or incomes is also needed.  There should be increased grant funding for solar PV, as well as a national body to run retrofitting by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000040#NN00400","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1663699200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion and the Minister of State for being here.

The ESRI paper of June 2022 on energy poverty and deprivation estimated that recent energy inflation had increased expenditure-based measures of energy poverty to almost 30%.  It considered a household to be energy poor if it spent 10%.

The various answers to me and other Deputies who have tabled questions indicate that the target is not to upgrade half a million houses up to BER B2 standard at all.

When basic data are provided, for example, showing that zero houses were retrofitted in 2018 and 2019, nothing is done by the Government.

I am critical of Galway County Council but in this case it has done its job and the Department has utterly failed to issue guidelines on operating the decarbonisation zone.<\/p> <p> Climate change is a huge issue.

That is problematic.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, and this is calling it very clearly, a certain number of people are qualified to do retrofitting but builders may do the work for a person and forget about the grant that could make the job cheaper.  I have seen cases of that.  Under the Government's warmer homes scheme, most people do not get a deep retrofit but get only an oil or gas boiler.  Condensing boilers are more efficient but they are not ideal because they will rely on oil or gas into the future, although they reduce bills somewhat.  There are other options the Government has not looked at.  If reducing emissions is the goal, why has it not considered hydrogen fuel, which is coming into the country at the moment?  It reduces emissions by 90%.  We have not gone down that road, which would help people and also help meet the targets.<\/p>  <p>  Having ideals is grand and so is believing that next summer we might be in a better place.

If it fails to do that, we will be in trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000041#OO00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1663699800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  I am delighted there is so much interest in retrofit.  There was not always such interest.  In the past, when retrofit schemes were proposed there were cynical responses about how many years it took for the payback.  Those calculations about how long it took for payback were based on assumptions about the future price of electricity and gas.  We have since found out that those assumptions were wrong.<\/p>  <p>  In February last, the Government introduced a dramatic new retrofit scheme which allowed for grants of up to 80% for those measures which were the most effective, in other words, attic and wall insulation.  The response to that change has been huge.  There is no need to sell retrofit to the public.  Everybody knows what it is now and everybody wants it.  That scheme was introduced in February before the war started.  The element of the war that Ireland is involved in is the response to the sanctions against Russia.  Putin's response has been to attempt to divide Europe, make us fight against each other and crush our solidarity and resolve.  I am glad to see we are all on the same page as regards the need to reduce our emissions and consumption, which is even more important than adding more energy to the grid.<\/p>  <p>  I will quickly update Members on the retrofit scheme.  At the end of August, more than 30,000 applications had been received by the SEAI, which is a 140% increase on the level that was seen in the same period last year.  Applications for the new enhanced attic and cavity wall insulation grants tripled compared with the same period last year.  These are highly cost-effective upgrade measures and they will help homeowners to save energy this winter.  We are talking about an expenditure of between &euro;300 and &euro;400 for a home.  Applications for heat pumps and external wall insulation are up 80% and 40%, respectively.  In addition, demand for solar photovoltaic schemes has been extremely positive this year.<\/p>  <p>  While driving demand is important, delivering the retrofits is even more crucial.  In regard to what has been delivered so far, the SEAI target for this year is 27,000 home energy upgrades.  The latest projections from the SEAI indicate that this challenging target will be met.  This means 27,000 families will be made cosy in their homes.  Figures for the end of August show that 13,400 homes had been upgraded across the SEAI schemes.  This compares with a total of 7,900 for the same period in 2021.  More than 4,200 of these homes are upgraded to BER B2 or better and this compares with a total of just under 1,800 for the same period in 2021, not ten as one Deputy stated earlier.  Under the solar PV scheme output for this year, we will exceed the target for PV to deliver 6,600 solar roofs.  Demand and delivery under the new national home energy upgrade scheme have also been robust, with a pipeline of work for the remainder of the year and into 2023.  There are currently 11 one-stop shops registered.  A 12th is expected to be announced shortly and another 14 organisations are at various stages of the registration process.  We expect to have about 20 one-stop shops registered by the end of the year, which was the target.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that even with the enhanced grant rates, many homeowners will need to access finance to fund their upgrade.<\/p> <p>For that reason, my Department is engaging with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the European Investment Bank, EIB, on the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme.  This scheme will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates to private homeowners and non-corporate landlords and will make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to the public.  It is intended that the loans under the guarantee will be available in the coming months.<\/p> <p> More than 2,400 homes have already been completed under the warmer homes scheme this year.  That is nearly three times the number of homes completed in the same period in 2021.  The retrofit works delivered under the scheme are extensive.  SEAI data show an average investment of &euro;18,750 per home retrofitted under the scheme in the first half of the year.  Month-by-month delivery of free energy upgrades under the scheme has doubled since last year and has reached the target of 400 completions per month.  To sustain and build on this progress, the following actions have been taken.  First, the SEAI has been allocated additional staff to administer the scheme.  Second, additional funding has been sought from the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.  Finally, the SEAI has completed a 4% increase in costs for all contractors from June in order to address the ongoing supply chain challenges.<\/p> <p> In line with the national retrofit plan's principles of fairness and universality, there is a need to ensure that all housing types and consumer cohorts can participate.  For this reason, specific measures to stimulate retrofit activity among approved housing bodies and in the private rental sector were also included in the package of measures which the Government announced in February.<\/p> <p> The residential rental sector poses a particular challenge and in this sector the incentives to invest in energy upgrades are misaligned between landlords and tenants.  This impacts negatively on the energy performance of the sector.  This complex problem is seen in many countries and is referred to as the \"split incentive\".  To address this issue, non-corporate landlords are eligible for the new grant supports available under the national home energy upgrade scheme, the better energy homes scheme and the community energy grants scheme.  It is also intended that non-corporate landlords will be able to avail of the planned low-cost loan scheme for retrofit when it is launched in the coming months.<\/p> <p> A further key step associated with addressing this issue for tenants will be the introduction of a minimum BER rating required for rental properties for all landlords.  The Housing for All strategy, which is being led by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, includes a commitment to introduce this requirement from 2025.  Collectively, these measures will mean that the national housing stock is upgraded and tenants get lower energy bills and a more comfortable place to live.<\/p> <p> There are approximately 36,500 local authority homes which will be retrofitted in the coming decade under the local authority retrofit scheme.  This programme of work will not only benefit local authorities in assisting them in the upgrade and maintenance of their housing stock but will also directly benefit householders with an enhanced level of comfort and lower fuel costs.  This year, the energy efficiency retrofitting programme will see approximately 2,400 local authority homes nationally being upgraded to a B2 or equivalent standard, with a significant increase in funding support to local authorities to &euro;85 million.  That compares with just two years ago when funding of &euro;25 million was provided for local authority retrofits.  When moving from funding of &euro;25 million to funding of &euro;85 million, staff must be provided.  Staff were provided in every local authority in the country to carry out that work.  These are trained retrofit engineers.  It is right that this funding of &euro;85 million is targeted towards local authority tenants who are at risk of energy poverty.<\/p> <p> While it is important, retrofitting on its own will not address the cost-of-living challenges faced by homeowners across the State.  The Government now intends to build on the &euro;2.4 billion package of measures already in place to support people to meet the cost of energy in the forthcoming budget.  A new action plan to combat energy poverty will set out a range of measures to be implemented ahead of the coming winter, as well as key longer term measures to ensure that those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected.<\/p> <p> I emphasise again the critical importance of the role of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which oversees non-price aspects of competition and continues to take steps to increase transparency, customer protection and consumer engagement in retail markets.  In August, under response No. 6 of the national energy security framework and following engagement with customer representative groups, energy suppliers and network operators, the CRU announced enhanced consumer protection measures.  These include, an extension to moratoriums on disconnections, a reduced debt burden on pay-as-you-go meters, better value for those on financial hardship meters and the promotion of the vulnerable customer register.  These are important additional protections for consumers during a very challenging time.<\/p> <p> As outlined, this Government has set ambitious retrofit targets for Ireland for the end of this decade, including almost halving greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector by 2030; upgrading almost a third of the country&rsquo;s housing stock to a building energy rating of B2 or carbon equivalent; and installing 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older less efficient heating systems.  This represents one of the most ambitious retrofit programmes in the world.  However, under the national retrofit plan, we are making tangible progress.  My officials will continue to work with the SEAI to build on the work to date.  The operation of the schemes will be kept under review taking account of the overarching need to build a much bigger home upgrade sector, the evolving science, innovation and technology, and other relevant factors.  We want to ensure that grant levels continue to be appropriately matched to the costs that people pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000041#OO00300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663700400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion because there is so much worry and uncertainty about energy and keeping warm this winter.  The issue is coming up at all the doors when I meet constituents in Prosperous, Naas and Kilcock.  They are so worried about their energy bills and so scared they will not be able to turn on the heating for their children when they come home from school, they cannot even consider the Government&rsquo;s retrofitting plan.  People are particularly concerned about older parents who worry so much about paying bills and taking out loans.  These are people who work hard and live week to week and month to month.  They cannot even consider the Government&rsquo;s retrofitting scheme which prioritises those who have the most over those who need the most.  The Government&rsquo;s stance on retrofitting projects, prioritising those who can pay the most over those who need the most, is the same as the unfair, unjust and unkind stance evident across its energy policy where the chosen ones, the haves, can depend upon warmth and fibre optics, while the have-nots can be consigned to the cold and candlelight.  As my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, said, its approach fails the equity test.<\/p>  <p>  A constituent who contacted me the other day received an electricity bill of more than &euro;400.  He lives alone on a disability pension and has not turned on his heating.  He has also decided not to turn on his lights and television and is only using the radio.  He is trying to do everything by candlelight now, which is a worry as it is a fire hazard.  He said the electricity supplier might as well cut him off immediately.  Does anyone think this man is considering retrofitting his home?  He and so many like him need what Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing in this motion for people on low and middle incomes.  For example, we propose a &euro;15 million retrofitting scheme for homes relying solely on solid fuel.  This would be of particular benefit in rural areas and would also improve our poor air quality, which we suffer so much from, while tackling poverty at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  We further propose a local energy action fund providing &euro;8 million for sustainable energy communities to fund local community-led retrofits.  We propose a 75% increase in funding for the solar PV budget, bringing that budget up to &euro;24.5 million for 2023.  These are no-brainers.  Supporting the motion is also a no-brainer as it would make such a difference to my constituents in Kildare North and others across the State.  We should use this energy crisis as an opportunity to lower our carbon emissions.  The motion we have put before the House would do just that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000042#PP00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1663700400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, an Teachta O'Rourke, for bringing forward this motion and providing us with an opportunity to have this very important debate.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to all of us being on the same page.  We are not really all on the same page, though, are we?  Some of us are not even in the same book if truth be told.  On the Minister of State's page, there are 9,000 people waiting up to 27 months to avail of the better energy warmer homes scheme.  On his page, a wealthy household can access up to &euro;25,000 worth of taxpayer-funded grants, while those on low or ordinary incomes are locked out.  So, no, we are not all on the same page and, as I have said, we are not even in the same book sometimes.  I genuinely wonder if Ministers hold constituency clinics and, if they do, whether they see how people are suffering.  Have their constituents brought them their electricity and gas bills and explained what they are doing?  Are they aware of the indignity people are living with during this energy crisis?<\/p> <p>They are standing in a shop for longer than they need just to stay warm.  If they are retired, they are getting money off their kids just to pay their heating bills or they are planning to go to bed at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening just to stay warm.  We need to be ambitious.  The Minister talks a lot about the need to be ambitious but we also need to look at where people are.  They are not on the same page as the Minister.  He needs to recognise that.  They need urgent interventions, they need support now and they need to know they will get through the winter.  They cannot fuel their houses with ambitions.  They cannot pay their bills with the Minister's ambitions.  They need direct action.<\/p> <p> That was the purpose of this motion.  We need to ensure that people can be warm in their homes.  The Minister referenced people being warm and cosy in their homes but that is just a pipe dream for many people as we head into winter.  This is not in any way personal but I am genuinely worried for where people are at, for the impact this will have on their mental health and for the impact this will have on their families.  I encourage the Minister, the Minister of State and their colleagues in government to act.  It is instructive to note that the Minister's Government partners have not sufficient interest to come in and speak on this motion this evening.  I would encourage them all to talk to people in their communities and to use the information they obtain, plus the motion we have brought this evening, to put in place measures that will make a real and meaningful difference to people who are now dreading this winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000042#PP00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663701000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank those who have contributed to this debate.  It is notable that neither Fianna F&aacute;il nor Fine Gael could present a speaker.  Maybe they do not see the same problems that we do.  Maybe they do not represent the same constituents that we do, namely, those who are struggling to access these schemes and to heat their homes this winter.<\/p>  <p>  I have to say in response to the Government contribution that we are setting out a clear challenge to the Government.  We have identified weaknesses in the schemes, as the Minister heard from a number on the Opposition benches.  We need the Government to increase funding.  We need to reorient the schemes to ensure they are targeted to those in need, those on low and middle incomes and those in local authority houses.  The schemes need to be targeted based on need.  There are far too many excluded from the schemes based on waiting lists, on strict eligibility criteria or on the inability to pay, given that they do not have the upfront funding to access the necessary grants.  I have not heard enough in response from the Government to be confident it is hearing exactly what has been said here, or that it is going to respond to address the barriers and the lack of flexibility.  There is a need to address the roll-out and the speed of lower-cost or shallower retrofits.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned by what I hear.  The Minister of State gave a lot of information and figures benchmarked against last year, which was in the middle of Covid.  It is no great achievement to do better than last year and to have that as a starting point.  My understanding is that the overall target is 27,900.  The Minister of State indicated that this is now at 13,400, but that just 4,200 of those are to B2 or B2 equivalent.  That is a very low number and is of real concern.  In that regard, I wonder is that the same as last year.  Are many of those B2 or B2 equivalents the result of a move from C1 by just putting solar panels on the roof, and that is another one off the list?  That is not the type of progress we need to see.<\/p>  <p>  We need targeted investment towards people who are going to struggle to heat their homes, who are living in cold homes, who are poor.  They need to be prioritised, not Deputies, Senators, wealthy people or people who have a spare &euro;25,000.  We will get to them but they are not literally at the coal face this winter.  The schemes need to be reoriented and they need to be prioritised.  Workers are busy retrofitting the homes of wealthy people.  We need to take that resource, because we do not have enough of those workers and contractors, and we need to put them where they are needed and, in the first instance, to address the long waiting lists and to expand those schemes.  Our approach is one that is efficient and effective.  It is about identifying the needs with the SEAI and local authorities and then working through blocks of houses in groups.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is not opposing the motion.

I asked the consultants, CEPA, to look forward at the security situation of both our electricity grids and gas supplies and to look at options.  In my mind, it benefits us to have a storage capability in gas and to look at that specific aspect of it.  We wanted to rule out options that would not help us to meet our climate targets.  That is why certain options are now proposed to go to public consultation, which we are doing.  Following that, they will be implemented as part of the energy security strategy we are following.  I believe that leads us towards not having a commercial LNG facility.  It still opens the possibility of a storage facility, whether floating or onshore, but it will be a strategic storage, operated to give us security in times when the gas might not be available.  That is a very unlikely scenario but we have to cover every eventuality.  As we have discussed in regard to the previous question, one of the concerns I have about some of the alternative approaches is that they would see a significant increase in emissions.<\/p>  <p>  Yes, climate change is at the centre of our approach as well as energy security policy needs in terms of the options that were considered in the consultant's report.  We are now putting the report out to open public consultation in order to hear every view, including that of the Deputy's party.  We will then act on the consultation by implementing the measures that we see as best fitting Irish needs.  We must have something that is fit for an energy future in which we are likely to convert our renewable offshore wind power into hydrogen that can be stored and transmitted.  Any new storage facility must be designed and built in a way that meets this need.  It also goes back to the debate we have had in this House for many years.  We do not want to be seen as a country or be part of a world in which there is a continued expansion of fracked gas in a way that is both bad for the countries in which it is initially produced and that risks the future health and security of everyone on this planet.

From my perspective, first, there is real risk in following such an approach.  It would be very good for the developer but it would not be good for our carbon budget.  On that criterion alone, it should not be pursued.  Second, what we were looking for in this report was to make sure we have a system that gives us energy security, which a commercial facility would not necessarily do.  We would have to contract it separately.

The report also recognises that further interconnection, especially in respect of our electricity markets, will give us greater stability and security in this regard.  Equally, as Deputy Smith said, it also recognises that we must be clever in how we manage demand.  Included in that facet is managing the demand for data centres.  We will need new data centres.  It makes sense for us to be good as a place where it is possible to store and manage data safely.  This is one of the main industries that provides many of the jobs and much of the income and wealth for us.  We need that.  We must do it, however, in a way that supports the electricity grid and gives us energy security while not resulting in a rise in climate emissions.  This is what the Government has set out.  Last September, the CRU and, subsequently, the Government, with EirGrid support, detailed how it is possible to design a system that is more energy secure and low carbon rather than just devising a demand-led solution take would not take those factors into account.

Data from the SEAI show that since the launch of the new measures in February, demand across the retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high.  As of the end of last month, more than 30,000 applications for support had been received by the SEAI.  This is more than double the number received during the same period last year.  This demand is translating into delivery, with 3,400 home energy upgrades having been completed with support from across the range of schemes.

Under the one-stop shop service, 330 homes had been completed to the end of August.  Demand for the national home energy upgrade scheme, which underpins the one-stop shop service, is high.

That will provide additional protections from disconnections and other safeguards for customers.<\/p>  <p>  The CRU, as I stated in an earlier contribution, is responsible for electricity regulation.  It ceased price setting for electricity and gas in 2011 and 2014, respectively.  Therefore, the setting of prices in that regard is a commercial matter for individual supply companies.  It also has statutory responsibility to ensure security of supply and has the duty to monitor electricity supplies and to make sure measures are in place as considered necessary to protect that security of supply.  The CRU, assisted by EirGrid and my Department, has a programme of demand and supply-side actions under way to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming winters.<\/p>  <p>  Our long-term priority and the best long-term approach for Ireland is to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets by investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expanding interconnection with European and neighbouring markets and deepening internal market integration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000046#TT00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663702800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The Minister stated that the price is because of the war.

It is because we have the most dispersed population in Europe and the price of getting electricity and getting gas and getting other energy to a dispersed population is much more expensive than to a concentrated one.  That is a reality.  Lastly, it is because of the smaller scale and geographic isolation of our markets.<\/p>  <p>  The answer to that is for us to develop our own fuels where we have comparative competitive advantage, particularly in wind.

The aim is for nature restoration measures to apply to a proportion of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030 and to eventually extend these measures to all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050.  In addition, there are proposals from the EU Commission to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides and a new soil health law to significantly improve the state of soils and protect soils on the same legal basis as air and water.  In combination, it is envisaged that these flagship legislative proposal will help ensure the sustainability, resilience and security of food supply in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  While the proposed EU nature restoration law is being negotiated there are measures, such as a voluntary eco-scheme, set out in the CAP strategic plan.  It is anticipated that it will be a key action in the delivery objectives of the nature restoration law.  The proposed EU nature restoration law will have implications for all land users in Ireland.

The meeting was split into two parts, with the first session covering policy options to alleviate the burden of high energy prices.  The second session was on the state of play of the preparedness of member states for the coming winter.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of higher energy prices, the council discussed in private session four main areas on which member states expected the Commission to act.  These included capping the revenues of electricity producers that face low production costs, a possible price cap on gas imports, measures for a co-ordinated electricity demand reduction across the EU, and measures that would help to address the issue of decreased liquidity for market participants.  The Commission has since published a draft regulation, which is under urgent negotiation by member states in order to have agreement by the end of the month.  We are supportive of the overall approach being taken and will co-operate closely with other member states to get the regulation agreed swiftly.<\/p>  <p>  Ministers also discussed the state of play of preparedness for this winter.  EU member states have carried out several actions at both national and EU level.  In particular, they have adopted a regulation to fill gas storage and to share gas in a spirit of solidarity, diversified supply sources and committed to reducing gas demand by 15% this winter.  EU gas reserves have been filled to 82.5% of their capacity, well ahead of the 1 November deadline set in the gas storage regulation.<\/p>  <p>  There was a fifth issue we discussed in the earlier session, looking at what measures we could take on global gas markets, particularly LNG markets, where we could use our purchasing power, perhaps in co-ordination with other countries, in Asia or elsewhere, to try to help reduce market prices that way as well.  That did not conclude, or has not concluded yet, with a specific proposal, but we gave a clear mandate for the Commission to investigate what might be possible in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000047#UU04400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663703400,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

Therefore, any requirement for us to reduce our gas use by 15% would not have material consequences in terms of the use or otherwise of Russian gas.  As a result, I stated that we have committed very much on a voluntary basis to do everything we can to reduce our use.

My Department and the Department of Finance have been exploring the potential to collect a portion of these windfall gains with a view to using the proceeds to support energy consumers.  Subsequent to this, there have been significant developments at EU level, which we just discussed.  At the Council of energy ministers on 9 September, which I attended, the issue of windfall gains was discussed in some detail.  Outline proposals were set out and the Council of energy ministers invited the European Commission to make formal proposals.  On 14 September, the Commission published a proposed regulation, which included measures aimed at addressing windfall gains in the electricity sector and in fossil fuel production.  These proposals are expected to raise additional revenues which will be used to reduce the cost of energy for households and businesses.  It is important that this proposal captures the windfall gains and minimises negative effects on consumers.  The proposal will be negotiated throughout the remainder of this month with a view of it being approved at a meeting of the Council of energy ministers on 30 September.  I fully support the objectives of this proposal and am working to ensure it fully addresses the issue of windfall gains in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make two further points.  First, it will be very difficult to get proposals that exactly fit our circumstances, including on the rate that would apply.  For example, the Commission proposed a rate of &euro;180 per megawatt hour and that they would be on the supernormal profits above that rate.  My personal view is that we should look for a lower rate.  Similar technical issues revolve around many aspects of this, which will make it easier or more difficult in different countries depending on the circumstance of each country.  Therefore, it is not an easy approach.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick and other Deputies asked earlier why I mention the European Union so much.  In this instance, we do have to work collectively because this is a temporary measure in response to a wartime event, where energy has been used in this way.

Some people might paint the windfall tax as a panacea for all our woes, which it certainly will not be.  Many commentators have more or less said that in the past few weeks.  An article I read said that the best benefit of a windfall tax might be in the name of social cohesion.  I am not so sure if that is why we should be making these types of decisions.  Many people will argue that the introduction of a windfall tax would be negligible in terms of its benefit for us domestically in terms of reducing prices.  That said, the backdrop is still the same.  Profit margins are going up for all electric and gas companies.  Profit margins have increased by 10% for ESB and by 74% for Centrica.  Internationally, Shell and BP posted massive profits of $11 billion and &euro;14 billion, not to mention SSE, the parent company of SSE Airtricity, which reported &pound;1.5 billion in profit.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the likelihood of a windfall tax coming in, are other mechanisms being looked at including those that are being considered in the UK, such as the 25% profit levy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000048#VV00900","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1663704000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy in that the proposals coming from European Union are just one element.

There must be continued use of energy credits, such is the high cost of energy that is hitting and affecting every house in the country.  It is appropriate to have timely, quick, easy to deliver and low-cost solutions such as the energy credits that we presented, as well as supports for businesses that will now be at real risk because of the tenfold increase in prices.<\/p>  <p>  It is an evolving situation.  We are right to do through to early spring so that we can reassess the prices then.  Even in the past three weeks, the international price of gas has fluctuated massively.

Most recently, the key findings from the international expert commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.  Notwithstanding this, it was deemed appropriate to carry out a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remained valid.  Having requested tenders from a number of grid experts across Europe, two international experts were selected to carry out the study.  Work is continuing on the report, which has taken longer than expected, but I understand it is to be finalised shortly.

It is for all businesses, including SMEs, and helps in the planning of any major investment in energy efficiency.  There is grant support of up to &euro;1 million per project available.  There is the support scheme for renewable heat.  It supports the adoption of renewable heat by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and public sector organisations.

My Department is examining what form that could take and it is part of our circular economy strategy at the moment.

There is an incentive in the country to reduce the quantity of unrecycled plastic that exists and to do everything we can to make sure it is reprocessed.

In all the years I was a councillor, and since I have become a Deputy, I have never seen anything like the avalanche of messages, requests and emails I am getting from parents in north Kildare, contacting me about bus na scoile.  It has been an absolute fiasco.  The Department announced free seats without making sure it had the actual seats in the first place.  It has led to chaos among families across north Kildare and across the State as well.<\/p>  <p>  I know from a reply to a parliamentary question that the Department did this after a couple of days liaising with Bus &Eacute;ireann.

I am a mother of three and for the past 17 years, including this year, I have put somebody on the school bus.  Living in Portlaw, where there is no secondary school, we have no choice.  Only for the school bus system, with five buses leaving Portlaw every morning, thankfully, my youngest is on the bus.<\/p>  <p>  I will provide an outline on the extent of the school transport first.  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

I know, particularly in the area where I am from, not having to pay that &euro;650, or &euro;220 in the case of primary school, was welcomed by school families.<\/p>  <p>  School transport ticket registration for the 2022-2023 school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications were received for mainstream school.  The figure included 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.  Already, 124,000 tickets for the mainstream scheme alone have been issued to applicants for the 2022-2023 school year.  At the start of the last school year, there were 103,000 children carried on mainstream school transport services, so already in the region of 20,000 additional places have been created.

I wish to deal with a particular aspect of it.  I like estates to have 10% social and 10% affordable.  That is what I want to see on every new estate that is built.  Part V provision was in place previously, with both 10% social and 10% affordable, but on many occasions the Part V obligation was bought out and did not happen.  That is no longer the case.<\/p>  <p>  However, I draw attention to the fact that under Housing for All and, more particularly, the Affordable Housing Act 2021, in the case of planning permissions granted before 3 September 2021, it is only the 10% social that applies.  The 10% affordable does not apply for private estates in that context.  For planning permissions granted after 31 July 2026, which is the bones of four and a half years away, the 10% social and 10% affordable - a total of 20% - will apply.  For planning permissions granted between 3 September 2021 and 31 July 2026 in respect of land purchased prior to 1 September 2015, the 10% social and 10% affordable apply.  However, for any land purchased between 1 September 2015 up to 31 July 2021, which makes up the bulk of the land that will be built on now, only the 10% social applies.  Why is that the case?  In the case of land purchased after 1 September 2021, the 20% total does apply, but the bulk of the land that will be built on in the coming years will be land that was probably purchased between 1 September 2015 and 31 July 2021.  That means that many of the private estates that will be built will not provide 10% affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  I passionately believe in the Part V model.  Why has this situation come about?  What can be done about it?  I ask the Government to reconsider this and amend it.  Whatever the cost that will have to be paid to the builders of these estates to ensure 10% of the houses are made available under the affordable model should be met.  I am talking about ensuring that, on an estate of 100 houses, ten of those houses would be set aside for affordable purchase.  That is what the people in Limerick whom I represent are seeking.  My worry is that will not be the case under the structure currently in place.  That may be based on legal reasons, but I want to know the reason for the decision and I want the Government to consider ensuring the 10% social and 10% affordable provisions apply to any planning permissions that are granted from now on, regardless of when the land was purchased.  If that requires additional funding from the Government to the developers of these sites, so be it.  I believe it would offer value for money because it provides people with affordable homes on private estates in their own communities.<\/p>  <p>  I believe in the model of estates that have 10% social, 10% affordable and 80% private.  It is a mix and it works.  There are other models and I very much acknowledge the fact there are 25 new houses going up under the affordable fund at the moment in Castletroy, where I live.  That is to be welcomed, but this is a slightly different thing.  Anyone who has been involved on the ground will understand what I am talking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000054#BBB00500","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1663707600,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I am taking it on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien.<\/p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government's strategy to increase housing supply, we have an ambitious target to deliver 300,000 new homes in the next decade.  This includes social, affordable purchase, cost rental, private rental, and private ownership housing. It has seen the Government make funding available for 54,000 affordable home interventions, including 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes, to be delivered between now and 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Part of this affordable housing delivery will be facilitated under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 Part V requirement.  These provisions were amended via the Affordable Housing Act 2021 and came into operation on 3 September 2021.  I know that is the matter to which the Deputy is referring.  The amendments increase the required Part V contribution from the current level of \"up to 10%\" to a flat 20% in housing developments.  This applies in situations involving five or more houses and enables the use of Part V for the provision of cost rental as well as social and affordable purchase housing.  A minimum threshold is in place and requires at least half of the Part V contribution to be for social housing provision.  Planning permissions granted before 1 August 2021 are not affected, as the Deputy noted.  The contribution remains at 10% for social housing purposes where planning permission is granted before August 2026 in respect of a site purchased between September 2015 and the end of July 2021, when the requirement was at 10%.  This transitional arrangement ensures that near-term delivery will continue, mindful that increasing the percentage could make developments unviable where the original financial appraisal was based on the 10% contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently preparing updated Part V guidelines for local authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  These guidelines, which are expected to be finalised shortly, will provide detailed information and clarification on the amended Part V requirements, including those aspects relating to affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim and in the period to 2026, the Government has committed the funding to deliver cost rental and affordable purchase homes via approved housing bodies, AHBs, local authorities, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the first home shared equity scheme.  Cost rental homes will be delivered by AHBs, local authorities and the LDA.  AHBs are currently supported by the cost rental equity loan funding, while local authorities can access funding for cost rental delivery through the Department's affordable housing fund.<\/p>  <p>  The LDA will also deliver cost rental on its own portfolio of sites and through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.<\/p> <p>The target under Project Tosaigh is the delivery of 5,000 new homes by 2026 for cost rental or sale to eligible households under affordable purchase agreements.  In regard to affordable purchase, the first home scheme was launched on 7 July last and aims to support in the region of 8,000 primarily first-time buyer households in acquiring new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026 with an overall budget of &euro;400 million.  The remaining affordable homes for purchase will be delivered by a combination of local authorities underpinned by the housing delivery action plans and supported by the affordable housing fund and the Land Development Agency, LDA, through Project Tosaigh as it continues work on public and State land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000054#BBB00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663708200,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I welcome the fact that there is a great deal happening on affordable housing.  As I said, the 25 units in Castletroy that are being built under the affordable housing fund through the local authority and all the other aspects such as the home equity scheme are all very welcome.  However this is a very particular point.  The Minister of State made reference to the fact that land purchased between 1 September 2015 and 31 July 2021 might be deemed - if Part V for affordable housing was implemented and for planning permissions granted on or after 3 September 2021 - unviable.  We are talking about 10% of an estate.  It is very simple.  This is down to funding.  If it is down to funding, then the Government should be funding the developers for any shortfall they have in terms of a development.  If we are looking for a model, it must be an integrated model.  We cannot have a situation where over the next number of years no private estate built will have affordable housing.  This is common sense.  I ask that it is taken back to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and that Government will look again at the legal implications of this measure to see if that shortfall, where a builder bought land between 3 September 2015 and 31 July 2021, can be funded, so that the Government funds that 10% for the affordable housing.

My biggest concern right now relates to the absence of a coroner in Carlow district.  We currently have 34 coroners in 38 coronial districts.  Why is there not a coroner appointed in Carlow?  There is temporary cover from Laois that is already three years in place.  As the Minister knows, coroners are appointed by the local authority except in the district of Dublin where appointment is by the Minister's office.  Where a vacancy arises in a particular coronial district and that district falls within local authority areas where there is more than one coronial district, the Minister's office may, following consultation with the local authority, direct another coroner from the same local authority area to assume the coronial duties of the vacant office.  These can then be amalgamated districts.  However there is no specific protocol in a case such as in Carlow where the passing of a coroner left a vacancy which has still to be filled and is currently being held by a coroner in a separate district for it to be filled from that district.  There is no urgency to fill the vacant role and this concerns me.<\/p>  <p>  Coroner districts within counties have been amalgamated from 48 districts to 38 in 2022.  Carlow remains a district, although it is without a coroner.  The legal requirements for a person to be appointed as a coroner or a duty coroner are set out in the legislation.  Are there any plans to broaden this?<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, no person shall be appointed to be a coroner or deputy coroner unless he or she is a practising barrister of at least five years' standing, a practicing solicitor of at least five years' standing or a registered medical practitioner who has been registered other than provisionally or temporarily under the Medical Practitioners Acts1927 to 1961 in the register of medical practitioners for Ireland or who has been entitled to be so registered for at least five years.  Yet there is no application process, no job site to which to apply, so what steps are being taken to recruit a Carlow coroner for a vacancy that is some years in existence?  To date only two such appointments have been made, one in Kildare and one in Meath.  My understanding is that there is a mechanism for the coroners service to recruit extra staff.  The Minister might come back to me on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 provided for the assignment and appointment of temporary coroners as part of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Yet, Carlow remains without one.<\/p>  <p>  Section 13 of the 1962 Act provides that each coroner shall appoint a deputy coroner, again in the case of Carlow, we do not have one.  We have been promised many times comprehensive reform in the system but we cannot seem to get the right staff in place.  I have argued for a review of the system, a widening of powers, a better system that empowers families left behind after a death, that provides more transparency and supports for those bereaved through suicide.  I support calls for better data collection so that we can learn lessons better and for recommendations made by coroners to have greater weight.<\/p>  <p>  In committee I called for a full-time coroner in each district reporting to the recruitment and resourced from a national coroners service with consistent standards of practice throughout the country and sufficient supports to ensure families left behind are supported in a most difficult time in their lives.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s plans for these vital reforms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000055#CCC00500","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1663708200,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murnane O'Connor for raising this important matter and for giving me an opportunity to provide clarity on some of the issues and to outline what has been done to date.  We have plans to do further work.  As the Deputy outlined, the coroners service is a network of coroners and districts throughout the country.  Coroners are independent, quasi-judicial officials whose function is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that a death certificate can issue.  This is an important public service in particular to the next-of-kin, to friends and family of the deceased.  Coroners not only provide closure for those bereaved but also provide a wider public service by identifying matters of public health and safety concerns.  As Deputy Murnane O'Connor rightly outlined, my justice plan 2022 commits to bringing forward this year nationwide review proposals to deliver a service improvement plan to address identifed issues, drive innovative change, enhance customer service and improve interaction with pathology services.  Until I have that review, going into more detail is not possible at the moment but I am committed to doing it by the end of the year and will engage with the Deputy when I have that report.<\/p><p>I will outline what has been done to date because there have been many updates of the 2000 review of the coroners service related to the strengthening of the legal provisions regarding the work of the coroner.  Since then there has been significant implementation of a number of those recommendations first through the amendments to the Coroners Act 1962, in particular, the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005, which ended the restriction on the number of medical witnesses allowed at inquests, and the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which provided for the restructuring and amalgamation of coronial districts and which the Deputy outlined.  It has gone from 48 districts in 2000 to 38 in 2022.<\/p> <p>The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provided for legal aid and legal advice by certification by the coroner to the Legal Aid Board in respect of inquests.  We then had the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019, which clarified, strengthened and modernised the powers of a coroner in the reporting, investigation and inquest of deaths.  The scope of inquires at inquest was expanded beyond being limited to establishing the medical cause of death to seeking to establish, to the extent the coroner considers necessary, the circumstances in which the death occurred.  The Act also broadened the coroner's powers relating to mandatory reporting and inquests of maternal deaths, deaths in custody or childcare situations, as well as significant new powers to compel witnesses and evidence at inquest. <br\/><br\/>More recently, we have the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, which provided, among other items, for the assignment and appointment of temporary coroners to act simultaneously with other coroners in exceptional circumstances.  This was used in part of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  There have been a great deal of change, amendments and Acts in the past decade or so to improve the overall structure and system but we are reviewing it now again to see what more we can do to ensure that it is the system that works as effectively as it can.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Carlow, Mr. Eugene O'Connor has been<i>in situ<\/i>as coroner to Laois since 1996.  As deputy coroner for Carlow, he assumed the duties of coroner for Carlow upon the unexpected death of the Carlow coroner, Dr. Brendan Doyle, in April 2019.  <br\/><br\/>As the Deputy has rightly said, the appointment of coroners to districts outside of Dublin is a  function of the relevant local authorities.  The Department and I are not aware of any plans to appoint separate coroners to these counties at this time but obviously, that is a matter for the council to decide and is not something I would prevent or stop it from doing.  <br\/><br\/>It is available to the coroner for Laois and Carlow, Mr. Eugene O'Connor, who has assumed duties, to request that I as Minister for Justice would authorise the deputy coroner, where there is a deputy coroner in Carlow at the moment, to act contemporaneously, that is, in line with or at the same time as the work that he is doing.  The option is there for him to request that I would approve such a measure.  It is something that I can do and it may, perhaps, be something that the Deputy might want to suggest will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000055#CCC00600","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663708800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The garda&iacute; in the squad car must have been very shook up because it looked as if the criminals were intent on doing serious damage to the car and injury to those inside.<\/p>  <p>  It is a pity, however, that it took to ramming of a Garda car for the authorities to sit up and take notice.  This has been, as I have said, ongoing for a number of months with little visible impact from the minor actions the Garda has taken to date.  Only two weeks ago I raised this matter with An Garda directly in a local policing forum and I know that my colleague, Councillor Daith&iacute; Doolan, who is chair of the local policing forum and who was injured by one of these gangs when he interceded on behalf of a besieged constituent, has been contacting the Garda morning, noon and night when a robbed car is spotted rallying and endangering children in the area.  <\/p>  <p>  More garda&iacute; and more Garda resources are required.  One squad car is not enough for the whole of Ballyfermot.  Two garda&iacute; in a car going to tackle three racing, robbed cars and being cheered on by 50 or 60 people, is not enough.  No visible patrols for most of the year is not good enough.  Accelerated planning and delivery of the Cherry Orchard local area plan needs to happen, including additional resources and extensions for St. Ultan&rsquo;s Primary School.  There also is a need for shops.  Approximately 40 years after this area was built, there are no shops, barbers, hairdressers, butchers, caf&eacute;s or anything like that.  That shows this area has been neglected and that neglect must end. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000056#DDD00500","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1663708800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has said, the scenes played out last night in social media were shocking for many but they are not shocking for the residents of the area who have been putting up with this kind of thing night after night for months.<\/p>  <p>  Some of us local representatives have been working together to raise the issue by working with the community and with community development organisations.  Excellent work is being done in the community but the funding is constantly on a knife edge.  We need to be looking at how we can work with the community, which wants to see an end to this kind of behaviour.  As my colleague has said, we need to see more garda&iacute; on the beat and to see a higher level of community policing.  Based on replies to parliamentary questions, only approximately 6% of the local Garda station's complement is dedicated towards community policing.  This compares to a national average of 19%, to 13% in other areas, or even 66%, I believe, in Carlow.  I appreciate that many of the decisions on community policing are made at a divisional level but they are made in the context of the wider manpower available.  We need, therefore, to look at the manpower that is available to the Garda in order that its members can get out on the beat regularly and build up the relationships they need in this community to enforce the law effectively.<\/p>  <p>  Communities like Cherry Orchard feel marginalised, ignored and invisible because this kind of behaviour has been happening.  When communities feel so marginalised, this kind of behaviour is inevitable.  We need to invest in these communities but we also need to show them that we care about them by putting garda&iacute; on their streets to protect the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000056#DDD00600","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1663708800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for raising this issue in the House today.  This incident is very much at the forefront of our mind today and the incident referred to by the Deputies is completely unacceptable for those living in the local communities who have to put up with it.  I agree with Deputies in condemning this in the strongest terms.  What we saw was a blatant disregard for the law, for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who were going about their business but most importantly, for the people in the area who should not have to put up with this.<\/p>  <p>  We will always support communities affected by antisocial behaviour and criminality.  They are as appalled by what has happened as we are.  We will also put supports in place to ensure that there are the services and facilities for young people in all of our communities.<\/p>  <p> Speaking from a justice perspective, however, and I will touch on what has been invested specifically in the Cherry Orchard area in the past year or so, but we have to do this in a comprehensive way in order that it is a Garda response but is also making sure that we have the other resources in place.<\/p>  <p> I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner and have asked him to look specifically at what more we can do to try to tackle and deal with this type of antisocial behaviour.  To be clear, however, anyone who engages in this type of behaviour, in what were criminal acts last night with cars being stolen and with the types of incidents that were happening, must be punished and there must be repercussions at the end of the day.  We cannot allow communities to live in this kind of fear.  I also wish to convey my best wishes to the garda&iacute; who were involved in the incident last night.<\/p> <p>I agree that we are very lucky it did not result in a fatality, either of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or members of the community, or even those who were driving the cars and causing the havoc we saw on social media.  I would appeal to anybody in the area, as garda&iacute; have been doing, to try to come forward.<\/p> <p> I would like to outline some of the responses that have been happening because I do not think it is fair to say that nothing has happened in the past few months.  I have spoken to garda&iacute; following concerns that have been raised by Deputies in this House, including by my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, and others.  We have had Garda Operation Pr&eacute;ach&aacute;n in place since 20 August this year.  This is a specific operation focusing on car-related crime and antisocial behaviour.  Arising from that specifically, in the last few weeks seven arrests were made and seven individuals were brought before the courts and were placed under bail conditions, including curfews and other types of conditions.  In the Cherry Orchard area specifically, responding to the concerns that people have raised and these types of incidents relating to cars, there have been seven arrests.<\/p> <p> Separate from that, other issues have been raised in respect of antisocial behaviour.  Local Garda management have tried to enhance their high visibility policing presence with the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, public order unit over the weekends, although, as we saw, this incident happened on a Monday afternoon.  That has to be kept continually under review with regard to where the resources are, when they are there and making sure they are visible.  I have been informed by the Garda that there have been a number of meetings with community representatives to try to explore what more can be done, and also with regard to support from those like the armed response unit, the emergency response unit and the air support unit.  However, we do not want it to get to a stage where these units have to come into communities, and it should never get to that stage.<\/p> <p> The way to deal with it is the comprehensive response that I have mentioned, with more garda&iacute; and resources.  What I can say is that I am absolutely committed to increasing the number of garda&iacute;.  Templemore has reopened.  While we have had challenges with Covid-19, we are now nearly at the stage where we will have 200 recruits in Templemore every 12 weeks.  That will give rise to a significant increase in the numbers right across the country and in each area.  The new Garda operating model will mean we have more front-line garda&iacute; on the beat because HR, finance and desk work duties that can be done by civilians will be done in a more condensed way, allowing more front-line garda&iacute; out on the beat.<\/p> <p> In terms of dealing with more societal issues and supporting young people in particular, I want to highlight that in the last year &euro;300,000 has been invested specifically in Cherry Orchard.  There are two full-time youth justice workers, one part-time project manager, one family support worker and one early intervention worker.  The CODY project just last year received funding of &euro;62,000 to work with people involved in the antisocial use of scramblers, quad bikes and related crime.<\/p> <p> What happened last night was unacceptable and it should not have happened.  People should not have to put up with this.  I believe the garda&iacute; are doing what they can.  Of course, we need to make sure they have more resources but we also have to look at this in terms of a holistic response and how we can engage with the community more.  As the Deputies stated, it is about how we invest in community services and supports, looking at education and all of the various different preventative measures that are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000056#DDD00700","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663709400,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that there is some good work being done by garda&iacute; based in Ballyfermot.  I was aware of a number of arrests, but those seven arrests have not quelled the issue and it seems to be continuing unabated.  One resident wrote to me today who has set up a WhatsApp group with her mother.  She wrote: &ldquo;We have this group to notify and warn each other if there is a car out or an unsafe situation happening in the area to ensure we do not cross paths with it and can be safe coming and going from our homes.&rdquo;  That is residents living in siege and it needs to end.  We all have a role to play and I accept the role of local representatives, youth services, schools and the like.  However, there is an immediate need for a response from the Garda so this can be nipped in the bud, and it is a long bud at this stage.

The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, was out recently, as was the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, seeing the situation for themselves first hand.  In fact, where the crash happened, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, had been standing there less than 48 hours beforehand.

I know a report had been done outlining how there can be greater development, not just in the Cherry Orchard area but in the larger vicinity, so we need to make sure that report and that plan is put into action.  It is important that Dublin City Council, the local community, local representatives, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department come together as soon as possible to make sure we can advance those plans, so it is not just about policing and making sure the resources are on the ground.  I know there will be extensive patrols, including the public order vans that will be there this evening, and that increase in resources will continue until this type of behaviour abates and until there is a hold on what has been happening, not just last night but over the last number of weeks.  However, it is important that we look beyond the next few weeks and to the longer term.  I am committed to working with Deputies and, most importantly, with the community to make sure the plan is not just for policing, Garda visibility and the type of work that is being done in the criminal justice system, but that the resources that are needed, the investment in education and the wider collaborative piece can happen.
