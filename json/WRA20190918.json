The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. However, it does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies or where public service pensioners are employed outside the public service.<\/p><p>Pension abatement in the public service is structured to ensure that a pensioner's combined earnings from their current public service job plus their existing public service retirement pension, does not exceed the current equivalent of pensionable salary from their old public service job. Depending on those variables, the actual impact (if any) from the measure on a person&rsquo;s public service pension will vary from person to person. \u00a0For example, where a person&rsquo;s combined public service earnings from their current job plus pension are less than the current equivalent of their pensionable earnings from their old job e.g. in the Defence Forces, there is no reduction of pension.<\/p><p>I should point out that prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle \/ concept already operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally.\u00a0 However, this was only within individual sectors and bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service etc. The 2012 Act extends the principle across and between all sectors without exception, thereby restoring the arrangements that were in place until 1965.<\/p><p>I should also state that a public service pensioner already in public service employment<b><\/b>immediately before 1 November 2012 is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post\/position. However, if their employment status changes after that date, for example, where they secure a new post through promotion with their current public service employer or where they move to a different post or public service body, their pension is subject to abatement in accordance with the legislation.<\/p><p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the question of any changes to that Act would therefore be a matter for him in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Security Council","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[37691\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the securing of a UN Security Council seat; and if he has spoken to other foreign ministers regarding same.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>The expected date of the election for the two available seats in the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) for the UN Security Council term 2021-2022 is approximately nine months away. <\/p>  <p>  The campaign is a priority across the whole of Government.

The report by Agnes Callamard was published in June. Ms Callamard found that Mr Khashoggi was the victim of a premeditated extrajudicial execution, for which the State of Saudi Arabia is responsible. <\/p>  <p>  The report was discussed during an Interactive Dialogue with Ms Callamard at the Human Rights Council on Wednesday 26 June. An EU statement thanked Ms Callamard for her report, condemned the killing, reiterated that those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi must be held to account, and again called for &lsquo;prompt; effective and thorough; independent and impartial; and transparent investigations&rsquo;. The statement called upon Saudi Arabia to disclose all information available and to fully cooperate with all investigations into the killing. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also made a national statement at the dialogue, emphasising the importance of the protection of journalists and media workers, and joined calls that those responsible for the killing must be held to account. Officials from my Department have continued to raise our concerns about this case directly with Saudi officials - most recently with the Saudi Ambassador in Ireland last week - and to press for a transparent legal process.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In her report Ms Callamard called for the Human Rights Council, the UN Security Council or the UN Secretary-General to conduct an international follow-up criminal investigation for the purpose of determining individual liability and identifying options towards judicial accountability.

I have expressed deep concerns, in this House, in multilateral fora, and directly to Saudi officials, about the way in which the war in Yemen is conducted, by all parties. My Department has also consistently highlighted these concerns in our bilateral contacts with a number of third states which are involved in the conflict, including Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iran. <\/p>  <p>  We have emphasised the need for an end to human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law, and for full and unfettered humanitarian and commercial access. Most recently, my officials raised our concerns about the situation in Yemen with the Saudi Ambassador, in a meeting last week.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The promotion of human rights is a key element in Irish and EU foreign policy, and there are of course many states around the world in relation to which Ireland and the EU have human rights concerns. In addressing these, we need to tailor the different approaches available to us to different contexts, according to what is most likely to be effective. <\/p>  <p>  Restrictive measures or 'sanctions' are one potential tool of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Care needs to be taken to avoid counterproductive impacts of sanctions, including due to the potential they have to isolate the target country from the kinds of interactions where diverse views are expressed, and minds changed. In most cases, public and private diplomacy is the preferred approach. <\/p>  <p>  There have previously been calls in this house for an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia in light of that country&rsquo;s involvement in the war in Yemen. Some, though not all, of the EU\u00a0Member States which have arms industries have decided to halt arms exports to countries involved in the Yemen conflict. Although EU consensus on a full EU arms embargo does not currently exist, all EU Member States have signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty. <\/p>  <p>  The Treaty exists to ensure that arms sales\u00a0do not fuel conflicts, lead to serious violations of international human rights law, or allow arms to fall into the hands of non-state actors or terrorists.\u00a0It is often more effective to press for the implementation of commitments already made, reminding partners of what they have agreed to, rather than seeking agreement on new measures.

However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue and leadership by the party leaders in Northern Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The awful murder of Lyra McKee and the outpouring of public feeling that followed demands a serious response at political level. People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and deal with the issues and challenges that Northern Ireland faces at present, not least the difficulties raised by the UK exit from the European Union. The functioning of the North South Ministerial Council is also urgently required, to bring together the Executive and the Government to oversee and develop co-operation on the island, and as a vital part of the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the political parties, in particular the two largest parties, must live up to their responsibilities and be open to fair and workable compromises on the small number of outstanding issues, to secure the overall interests of people in Northern Ireland and to protect and operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement again. <\/p>  <p>  This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved. Accordingly, the Government will continue to do everything possible to support continuing engagement and progress in discussions between the political parties, working with the UK Government in any scenario, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD04400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Fiscal Advisory Council Reports","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[37689\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he and his officials have received the most recent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council report with its comments on a disorderly Brexit.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>I can confirm that I have received a copy of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council&rsquo;s Pre-Budget 2020 Statement, as published on Wednesday, 11<sup>th<\/sup>September.

With tax receipts to end-August in line with expectations and showing year-on-year growth of 8.1%, it looks likely that our Budget 2019 target of &euro;57.9 billion will be achieved. <\/p><p>I also note the Council&rsquo;s concerns around a &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; and in line with this view, last week I secured Government agreement to base Budget 2020 on this same assumption, that of a no-deal Brexit. In fact, given the uncertainty and lack of clarity regarding the timing and format that the U.K.&rsquo;s exit will take, preparing for a no-deal scenario is the most sensible approach. This, I believe, will help us to ensure that we safeguard our recent hard won progress in stabilising the public finances. <\/p><p>In addition, it is important that we avoid a situation whereby decisions are made this year that may need to be reversed in the future. By assuming a &lsquo;no-deal Brexit&rsquo;, we can ensure that the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge; whilst also preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances.<\/p><p>Finally, it is important to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a &lsquo;no-deal Brexit&rsquo; and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario. <\/p><p>Indeed, by continuing to balance our books, reduce our debt burden and build up the Rainy Day Fund, we are improving our resilience to the risks posed by Brexit and other risks that a small open economy such as ours faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Exemptions","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[37856\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800071#WRD04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the situations in which a householder with a house that has pyrite will be given an exemption from property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>The pyrite exemption is intended to apply to those properties that have a significant level of pyrite damage.

The evidence review is expected to be completed in March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor developments and publications by authoritative bodies internationally on\u00a0the safety of e-cigarettes and\u00a0whether they facilitate smoking cessation.<\/p>  <p>  E-cigarettes are regulated under the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 271\/2016). These Regulations transpose the EU Tobacco Products Directive (Directive 2014\/40\/EU).<\/p>  <p>  Under these Regulations health warnings which advise consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance are mandatory. The Regulations also provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers.<\/p>  <p>  Finally the Regulations require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products that they place on the market and, if a manufacturers, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the Health Service Executive and to explain what corrective action has been taken.<\/p>  <p>  Later this month I intend to bring forward a draft scheme for a Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill which will include provisions to:<\/p>  <p>  - introduce a new licensing system for the retail sale of tobacco products and nicotine-inhaling products such as e-cigarettes.<\/p>  <p>  - prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products to persons under the age of 18.<\/p>  <p>  - prohibit the sale of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products by persons under the age of 18.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800073#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800073#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[37787\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800073#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the costs incurred to date and the projected costs regarding the integrated finance and procurement management system project design that is being refined to incorporate changes arising from the decision to create six new regional health areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>My officials have asked the HSE to respond to you directly on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800073#WRF05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800073#WRF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[37794\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800073#WRF05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a surgery appointment will be scheduled for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The company provides approximately 1,000 direct jobs at present, which in turn supports at least another 1,000 indirect jobs.    In its strategy to exit peat, Bord na M&oacute;na envisages the development and scaling up of new business opportunities to ensure the future commercial viability of the company and enable it to continue to fulfil its mandate to be an employer of scale in the Midlands. This strategy is aimed at developing a transition from peat to sustainable new businesses which utilise the vast landbank over the period to 2028. ESB is also fully committed to the process to lead decarbonisation in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  On 23 July An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused ESB planning permission to continue operating West Offaly Power station beyond the end of 2020. ESB's application sought planning permission for the plant to co-fire peat and biomass out to the end of 2027. ESB are currently evaluating An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision. ESB have also submitted to Longford County Council a planning application to continue operating Lough Ree Power station beyond the end of 2020. A decision by Longford County Council is expected shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Following this decision my Department and I are intensively assessing the options to ensure a just transition, if an earlier exit from peat than planned is required. <\/p>  <p>  On 31 July I met with the Bord na Mona Board and worker directors, and with Oireachtas Midlands representatives, the Midlands regional transition team, the regional enterprise plan team, and the regional skills fora team. I am scheduled to meet with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions this week. <\/p>  <p>  Several strands are being considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s response: <\/p>  <p>  -  Bord na Mona diversification <\/p>  <p>  -  Accelerated programme of bog restoration by Bord na Mona <\/p>  <p>  -  An area based retrofitting initiative <\/p>  <p>  -  Other special initiatives for regional development <\/p>  <p>  I have secured the inclusion of the Midlands in the Platform for Coal and Other Carbon-Intensive Regions in Transition, which supports regions affected by climate policy. Following a letter I wrote to Commissioner Canete in March seeking the inclusion of the Midlands Region under the Platform, the Commissioner confirmed in July that the region would be included. <\/p>  <p>  Membership of the Platform enables the Midlands Region to avail of the support of a dedicated Country Team, comprised of Commission experts, to assist with the development of strategies and projects for the region, focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers affected by decarbonisation. The Team will also assist in identifying appropriate EU funding opportunities for the Midlands. The meetings of the Platform also enable the exchange of knowledge and ideas between carbon-intensive regions.A preliminary meeting of this Team with officials from relevant Departments and other stakeholders is planned to take place in the middle of October with a view to the Country Team coming to Ireland in November. The already established Midlands Regional Transition Team, led by Offaly County Council, will play a central role in this process as it evolves.<\/p>  <p>  An interdepartmental group led by Department of An Taoiseach has been established to develop a just transition plan for the Midlands. Clearly this work cuts across a number of Government Departments, including my own Department, Public Expenditure and Reform, Business, Employment and Innovation, Rural and Community Development, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p>  <p>  I will respond formally to the Deputy's submission in the coming days. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800075#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800075#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[37875\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800075#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will define the midlands peat region as designated in the EU platform for coal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":406,"content":"<p>The Platform for Coal Regions in Transition was launched in December 2017, as part of the Coal and Carbon-Intensive Regions in Transition Initiative of the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package.

One of the Recommendations of the Report involved calls for the Irish Film Board - now Screen Ireland - to constitute its Film Forum with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry. While Screen Ireland commenced efforts to constitute the forum in autumn last year, it was unable to do so. There was disagreement between various bodies representing employees and workers in the industry who would not agree to meet and given the contrary positions of the parties who should participate in the Film Forum, Screen Ireland informed the Joint Committee in December that it could not proceed without excluding one or more of the parties who should participate. There was also a concern that rather than providing a mechanism for a collaborative and inclusive approach to develop and exchange ideas to enhance the industry, the forum would instead amount to little more than the airing of disputes and grievances that had previously been raised before the Joint Committee.\u00a0 As the deputy is aware, disputes and grievances should be dealt with through the formal mechanisms of the State and the Government has a well-resourced labour inspectorate, which forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) whose core services include the inspection of employment rights compliance, the provision of information, adjudicating on complaints under employment protection, equality and industrial relations legislation and the provision of mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services. In the meantime, efforts have continued to identified a way forward that might address concerns raised. I am now advised that following a joint request by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the Services, Industry, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU), and Screen Producers Ireland (SPI), the WRC has agreed to undertake an audit of the Republic of Ireland Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  - examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure,<\/p>  <p>  - assessing issues arising (if any), and<\/p>  <p>  - making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The WRC has published a Workplace Relations Notice on its website, inviting submissions from stakeholders on the above listed matters by 31 October 2019. The results of the audit should inform any further actions that might be taken on the matter of the film forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800077#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[37898\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800077#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide a detailed assessment on the way in which the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht report on development and working conditions in the Irish film industry has been implemented.","asker":"1239","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>The Report of the Joint Committee was launched on 12 July 2018, just a few weeks after the Government published its Audiovisual Action Plan on 27 June 2018.\u00a0 The Report made 11 Specific Conclusions and Recommendations, many of which complement the actions set out in the Audiovisual Action Plan. In May of this year, the D&aacute;il debated a motion regarding the Report wherein I set out the progress in implementing the recommendations of the Report. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendations 1, 3, 5, and 11 have been addressed under revisions to the section 481 tax incentive. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 1 sets out that &ldquo;section 481 is a key and central component within the Irish Film Industry. This fact is accepted by the vast majority of the industry&rsquo;s stakeholders. Section 481 will remain central in the industry into the future&rdquo;. \u00a0\u00a0Changes were made to section 481 in the Finance Act 2018, designed to reduce the time required to decide on applications for the relief. Previously, applications were made directly to Revenue. Now, a producer company applies directly to the Department for a certificate stating that the film is to be treated as a qualifying film for the purpose of section 481.\u00a0 The Finance Act 2018 also made provision for the extension of section 481 tax relief beyond its 2020 deadline to 2024. It also provided for an additional measure, the Regional Film Development Uplift which is a short-term, tapered regional film development uplift commencing at 5%, for films made in an area designated as an assisted region under the State aid regional guidelines. The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis with 5% available in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2020, 3% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2021, 2% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2022, and reducing to 0% from year 2023 on. The consent of the European Commission to both these state aid measures has now been received and Regulations and a Commencement Order introduced in July 2019 gave effect to these measures. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 3 saw the committee seek &ldquo;the reform of training in the sector to ensure that all training has a recognised qualification where possible, has a beginning and an end, and that trainees are not forced to repeat specific training&rdquo;. The Committee proposed that &ldquo;there be a wider geographical spread of training courses, the introduction of formal apprenticeships and additional finance to improve this training and development.&rdquo; The Regional Uplift measure outlined above is designed to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector and ensure a spread of production activity beyond the current traditional production hubs in Ireland by incentivising the training and development of new, local pools of talent in the film sector in areas outside the current main production hubs. \u00a0In the matter of the training requirements of Section 481, changes targeted at improving outcomes have recently been effected and there is now\u00a0a strong focus on skills development that is linked to quality, and a more expansive range of skills development at all levels, including hard skills, soft skills, future skills, technical skills and leadership skills. As part of these revised requirements, films with eligible expenditure of over &euro;2 million must have their Skills Development Plans agreed in advance with Screen Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0 The plans developed by Screen Ireland require applicants to consider carefully the skills needs of the production, the company, the participant and the sector as a whole and to reflect on how the planned activity will address skills needs across different levels and different departments of the production from new entrants, trainees and crew to above the line talent and company leaders. This is designed to move away from a system where individuals are labelled as trainees and go some way towards addressing the concerns that the Committee flagged. In addition, there is considerable work going on in relation to training. Last November, Screen Skills Ireland, the training and skills development division of Screen Ireland held an Education Forum for the audio visual industry, bringing together Screen industry stakeholders, education and trading providers and policy influencers to focus in the skills development challenges and opportunities. This forum was a success and will be repeated in early November this year. In terms of accredited courses, Screen Ireland has submitted two Level 9 courses (Creative Leadership and Advanced Producers) to be developed and certified through Springboard+. These courses are in direct response to one of the recommendations in the Olsberg Report that new business skills courses be generated, specifically focusing on the needs of creative sector companies. Screen Ireland is also developing a certified Level 8 Apprenticeship programme, for the role of CGI Technical Artist, in the animation and related sectors. A network of Regional Skills Fora was created as part of the Government&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy and provides an opportunity for employers and the education and training system to work together to meet the emerging skills needs of their regions. Regional skills, in conjunction with SOLAS (The Further Education and Training Authority) has introduced a skills initiative &ldquo;Skills for Growth&rdquo; which is designed to make it easier for employers to identity their skill needs and receive guidance on which education and training providers are best suited to their requirements. \u00a0Skillnet Ireland, the national agency for the promotion and facilitation of workforce learning in Ireland currently has 23 programmes planned for 2019 that are of relevance to workers in the film industry. These programmes include courses in Business Skills, Leadership and Project management through Animation Skillnet; Design Enterprise Skillnet; Greas&aacute;n Na Me&aacute;n Skillnet; and Screen Skillnet. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 5 outlined that an &ldquo;international comparative study should be constituted to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the Section 481 tax credit&rdquo;. Since the \u00a0publication of the Report, as part of its work for the Finance Bill 2018, the Department of Finance published its review of the section titled &lsquo;Review IV:\u00a0 Cost Benefit Analysis of Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &ndash; Film Corporation Tax Credit&rsquo;.\u00a0 This analysis was the catalyst for the administrative changes to the section 481 application process. I understand that the Department of Finance will conduct a further review in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 11 called for &ldquo;Public funding and adherence to employment standards&rdquo; to be linked. The Film Regulations 2019, introduced to give effect to changes in the section 481 procedures include a signed undertaking in respect of quality employment which requires both the producer company and the qualifying company to comply with all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law.\u00a0 The producer company and the qualifying company must be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer, have in place written policies and procedures in on Grievances, Discipline and Dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity).\u00a0 The companies are also required to provide details of any Work Place Relations Commission decisions aligned with confirmation that any findings against the companies have been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed. This also addresses Recommendation 2 of the Report which expressed concerns with regard to working terms and conditions. While matters relating to collective bargaining rights of freelance workers do not fall directly under my remit, my Department has used the opportunities presented by the changes made to the section 481 procedures to improve conditions in the industry particularly in relation to training and commitments undertaken by producer companies. \u00a0Recommendation 8 also deals with working conditions and more particularly, calls for state support for &ldquo;the precarious existence of actors and sustainable pension structures for workers within the Irish film industry&rdquo;. This comes within the remit of the Minister for\u00a0\u00a0 Employment Affairs and Social Protection, who passed legislation in the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 in December 2018 which addresses insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. In July this year, I was pleased to join my colleague and Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty TD, in announcing the extension of the Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists to the wider Creative Community. This means that from this month on, self-employed artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance for the first year that they are out of work will be able to focus on their artistic work and developing their portfolio, rather than having to participate in the normal labour market activation activities. Artists eligible to apply to the scheme include actors, theatre and film directors, dancers, opera singers, set, costume and lighting designers, musicians, composers, choreographers, architects and street performers<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 6 called for workers within the craft grades of the industry to have representatives nominated to the Irish Film Board to feed in their perspectives and needs into the industry&rsquo;s development. However, as I set out in May, under the provisions of the Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2018, the Board of Screen Ireland as it is now known is not a representative board in the sense of comprising representatives from the various industry sectors:\u00a0 Section 12 of the Act provides that 7 members shall be appointed to the Board by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with the consent of the Minister for Finance for a period of not more than 4 years. When vacancies arise on the Board, they are advertised by the Pubic Appointments Service (PAS) and are open to applications from anyone who meets the requirements as set out by PAS. The next vacancies will arise in March 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 9 sought for the further integration of the film industry on a north\/south basis with the creation of formal north\/south structures, development plans and investment. \u00a0While Screen Ireland is in competition with Northern Ireland Screen in its efforts to attract inward production into the Republic of Ireland, it also regularly cooperates with Northern Ireland Screen in efforts to attract inward production to the island of Ireland. Earlier this year, Screen Ireland announced that, in conjunction with Northern Ireland Screen, it had teamed up with an international sales and film finance company Bankside Films on a joint venture that intends to produce, and fully fund, up to two feature films per year. It targets projects with a budget of up to &euro;1.5 million and creative teams on each project will come from both the north and south.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 4 saw the Committee call on the Irish Film Board to constitute the Board&rsquo;s Film Forum, with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry while Recommendation 10 called on the unions and the representative organisations to work towards a mutually beneficial and respectful understanding.\u00a0 As I set out in May, despite efforts made by Screen Ireland, last Autumn, it did not prove possible to constitute a forum of all stakeholders that would adopt a collaborative approach as suggested by the Report. Instead, it seemed that the forum would simply comprise of the airing of disputes and grievances which are more properly dealt with by the State through other mechanisms such as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). In recent days, the WRC has announced its intention to conduct an audit of the Republic of Ireland Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector with a view to examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure, assessing issues arising (if any), and making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate. The WRC invites submissions by 31 October 2019 and it is hoped that this audit will provide an appropriate mechanism to progress matters raised in Recommendation 4 and Recommendation 10. In addition, my Department will continue to work through the Audiovisual High Level Steering Group to address issues raised in the audiovisual industry, and to support the industry and the people who work in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800077#WRK01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Na hOile&aacute;in amach &oacute;n gC&oacute;sta","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800077#WRK01300"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[37939\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800077#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil t&uacute;s curtha le f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; na n-oile&aacute;n a mheas agus tosa&iacute;ochta&iacute; strait&eacute;iseacha &aacute; gcur chun cinn i gcomhar le pobail na n-oile&aacute;n sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; cult&uacute;rtha, s&oacute;isialta agua eacnama&iacute;ochta; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1316","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>T&aacute; na hoile&aacute;in &aacute;itrithe mar chuid t&aacute;bhachtach d&rsquo;oidhreacht an St&aacute;it agus t&aacute; s&eacute; mar chusp&oacute;ir l&aacute;rnach ag mo Roinn go leanfaidh pobail bhr&iacute;omhara, inmharthana ag\u00a0cur f&uacute;thu ar na hoile&aacute;in.\u00a0<\/p><p>D'ainneoin go bhfuil\u00a0dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta ag mo Roinn le blianta anuas i dtaobh feabhas a chur ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; rochtana do na hoile&aacute;in agus infrastruct&uacute;r caipital, is g&aacute;\u00a0dul i ngleic leis an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n sin agus f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; na n-oile&aacute;n a mheas agus tosa&iacute;ochta&iacute; strait&eacute;iseacha\u00a0a chur chun cinn.<\/p><p>Sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin, t&aacute; cinneadh t&oacute;gtha agam, le haont&uacute; an Rialtais, Coiste Idir-Rannach do na hoile&aacute;in a bhun&uacute;.
