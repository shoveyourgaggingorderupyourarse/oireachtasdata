Like the Chairman, I have been intensely engaged with the issue that is presented before us today as to the challenges facing our childcare sector.<\/p> <p>  I have the utmost respect for those who work day in and day out to look after our children.  I know that for many this is indeed a vocation.  They are significant people in the lives of children and also in the lives of parents.  Placing their child in the care of someone else is a huge decision for parents.  First and foremost they want their child to be safe and happy.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, that is also my priority.  All my decisions on childcare are determined by what is best for children.  I accept that sometimes these decisions do not suit everyone but the rationale is, and always will be, to have children at the heart.  It is important in the context of what we are discussing today to take stock of where we are.<\/p> <p>  In the past five years there has been a 110% increase in capacity.  The number of childcare places has more than doubled from 104,000 to 218,000.  Investment in childcare has increased by 141% and it is almost one and a half times what it was in 2015 when &euro;260 million was invested compared to &euro;638 million in 2020.  We have gone from one free preschool year to two free preschool years.  We opened the national childcare scheme, NCS, four weeks ago tomorrow.  In these four short weeks, the parents of more than 20,000 children will have received childcare subsidies for the first time, or significantly higher subsidies than a month ago.  To put this in perspective, if one takes the life of a four year old child who is currently in an Early Childhood Care and Education, ECCE scheme the world of childcare has changed beyond recognition since the day he or she was born.  This is good and positive progress but I am the first person to say that more needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  We can all be proud of the achievements and Irish people can be assured that their money has been well spent by the State in starting to address years of under-investment in childcare.  I have repeatedly said that in order to change from one of the most expensive countries in the world to one of the best for childcare we need to at least maintain and possibly intensify this rate of investment.  Through the national childcare scheme it is open to any future Minister or Government to increase the subsidies paid to parents.  The NCS is built for the future.<\/p> <p>  With this progress comes challenges.  The doubling of capacity and the stronger regulation requires more inspections.  Those working in the childcare sector have to achieve certain educational qualifications.  The doubling of capacity has led to a significant growth in the workforce and associated difficulties in getting suitably qualified childcare workers.  The introduction of necessary regulations requires childcare providers to undertake additional responsibilities, including additional administrative work, to demonstrate compliance.  Some childcare providers choose not to continue every year.  For example in 2018, 78 providers closed their doors.  However, 153 new childcare providers opened new services.  This led to an increase of 2,200 childcare places that year and there were many other new places resulting from other measures.  The average size of services has grown from 33 in 2015 to 47 in 2019.<\/p> <p>  This year, 2019, was a particularly onerous year for childcare providers due to a number of developments.  Some 4,300 of them had to re-register with Tusla in order to stay on the register and operate as childcare providers in 2020 and beyond.  While this was flagged from 2016, it still represented significant work.  I am pleased that the CEO of Tusla confirmed that almost 100% of childcare providers submitted their applications for re-registration by the due date.  He has also confirmed that it is processing applications received after 12 December.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to particularly acknowledge the pressures services have faced in 2019 and to acknowledge the pressure and stress that deadlines bring.  I hear this clearly from the sector.  My Department, Pobal and Tusla will try to address this in a meaningful way in 2020 and to simplify and streamline procedures so that those in the sector are not over-burdened with administration.  <\/p> <p>  To recognise how difficult this has been I have approved an additional, once-off programme support payment to all providers which will be made in the coming days, that is in December 2019.  This is in addition to the programme support payment already given to providers this year.  We value those who work in our childcare sector and perhaps they do not always feel our appreciation, but I would like to assure them on behalf of the Government that we do not take them for granted.<\/p> <p>  There are also challenges that have not yet been addressed.  Our childcare workers are significant people in the lives of children, parents and families and significant also in keeping our economy working.  They are poorly paid.  I have given my support for a sectoral employment order.  I have made provision in budget 2020 for a sectoral employment order support fund.  Paying childcare workers a decent wage is important for them as individual workers, for our children, for maintaining consistency of care in the lives of children, and for the quality of our childcare services.  I hope that sufficient numbers of workers join a union and make this a reality.  It is a key piece of the unfinished business.<\/p> <p>  I will address now a key issue affecting the childcare sector that has received much media attention in the past few days, which relates to media reports and some commentary around internal risk rating documents from Tusla.  I know that the CEO of Tusla has clarified that the risk ratings are used for the purpose of prioritising and scheduling more than 4,300 services for inspection.  It is a risk-based, internal, profiling system which is in line with a recommendation by the OECD.  I am aware that Tusla has circulated the committee members with his response to \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" on this matter.  I do not want to rehearse again what he has outlined except to say that the chief social worker in my Department has confirmed that in using the term risk register in order to schedule inspections, Tusla is identifying a risk to itself, namely to ensure that Tusla implements an inspection regime that is fit for purpose and provides most assurance across the sector.<\/p><p>The chief social worker notes:<\/p><blockquote>\tRegulatory bodies, in general, have two functions.  The first is to register all centres for compliance purposes &ndash; this provides public assurance.<br \/><br \/>The second function is to use its inspection resource proportionally to ensure inspectors are attending to those services which may have performance issues.<br \/><br \/>To do so the regulatory body uses the information available to it intelligently to prioritise its inspection schedule. <\/blockquote><p>A service may have been profiled as red simply because it has not been inspected recently and should be prioritised for one.  It may be a very good service.  I hope members of the committee find this further clarification by the chief social worker helpful.<br\/><br\/>I want to make a few points on insurance and the current state of play.  Over the course of the past year to date, there were three parliamentary questions, out of 1,500, tabled to my Department on insurance.  I understand Deputy Rabbitte referred to a press statement she issued in April 2019 during her election campaign for the European Parliament elections.  I do not know how many press statements she issued during her campaign but I confess I did not read all of her election material.  I am aware there were some representations made, including from Deputy Funchion at the end of last month.  The latter was responded to on Tuesday.<br\/><br\/>The cost of insurance for the childcare sector came into strong focus only in the past few weeks.  This has arisen following the withdrawal of an insurance provider from the Irish market and the confirmation that another could not be found.  It is undoubtedly causing distress to providers and worry to parents.  I acknowledge there are many providers who are facing increased insurance costs.  I am receiving representations from them also.<br\/><br\/>Until recently, there were two insurance underwriters offering insurance to the childcare sector in Ireland.  On 6 December, one of these, Ironshore, notified its 1,300 clients that it would be withdrawing from the market.On 17 December, Mr. Padraic Smith, the broker who had provided the Ironshore underwriting services, informed the customers that the company had failed to get a new underwriter to take over their client base.  This leaves only one underwriter currently offering insurance to the sector.  That, as we know, is Allianz. <br\/><br\/>The Government is limited in what it can do in this situation.  It cannot compel a private business to remain in the market, nor can it directly intervene in the pricing of insurance offered to childcare providers.  However, officials in my Department are working hard to find a way to support those services that have been impacted.  We have engaged with Allianz, which I understand has confirmed that it will offer quotes to all but the most high-risk services.Allianz, through the broker Arachas, is willing to consider quotes for all affected services.  Quotes are being processed within 24 hours in the vast majority of cases.Some 1,100 quotes had been issued by midday today to previous Ironshore clients.  This leaves 200 providers who have not yet received quotes.  I will receive an update on this tomorrow.  There may be a very small number of very high-risk services that will not receive quotations.<br\/><br\/>The press has reported that some providers are reporting significant increases in premiums.  I understand the premiums charged by Ironshore were considerably lower than the market average, and this is leading to the increases.<br\/><br\/>I understand that the average cost of Allianz insurance for full-time childcare is &euro;60 per year per child.  The average cost for sessional services, such as ECCE, is &euro;25 per year per child.  This equates to 0.5% to 0.75% of the turnover of a service.  I understand that the increase is causing difficulties for providers.<br\/><br\/>My Department and the city and county childcare committees are offering a number of supports for providers, including a case management system for services experiencing sustainability difficulties. <br\/><br\/>For community providers, who are one in four of all childcare providers, financial supports can be made available after an assessment through a process managed by the childcare committees and Pobal.  I would encourage services to contact their local childcare committee to access a range of supports, including advice or business planning. <br\/><br\/>With regard to the issue of insurance, I am liaising with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to consider a review of insurance in the childcare sector as part of my ongoing independent review of costs in the sector.  We need to make the market more attractive to both existing insurers and new entrants in order to increase competition, which in turn should lead to a reduction in pricing and an increase in capacity.<br\/><br\/>For the childcare sector, this includes compliance with regulations.  Compliance helps to manage risk.  Managing risk is important for children and should also make childcare facilities safer places.<br\/><br\/>I agree with the CEO of Tusla when he says that the childcare sector is largely compliant.  In my experience, we are lucky, or blessed, to have caring, compassionate champions for children working in our childcare sector.  They need and deserve our support.  They have had a very tough year. <br\/><br\/>Exposure of bad practice in any sector affects all of those working in it.  The impact of exposure can cause stress, disappointment and pressure.  The impacts are necessary to root out the small number who should not be caring for our children.  The majority, however, work hard and diligently in the best interest of children.I am glad that I am in a position to make a once-off payment averaging &euro;1,500 to providers to reflect their commitment.  This is under the programme support payment I established in 2017 to recognise the administrative burden on providers.  This support will come from existing resources available to me in 2019, and payments will be made by 28 December.  The range of payments will be from small amounts right up to &euro;26,000, for the very large providers, depending on the number of children being cared for.<br\/><br\/>This is a fast-moving situation but I am committed to supporting the sector appropriately, and, above all, to protecting children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#B00200","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister's taking the time to attend following the request of the committee this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#C00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#C00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am conscious of her time.

She mentioned the distress and worry caused among parents and providers in the run-up to Christmas.  I recognise this is not the responsibility of the Minister.  It is a matter for the Department of Finance, particularly its Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, in the sense that his role covers the insurance industry.  What efforts are being made to attract another provider to the market?  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs mentioned on two occasions that all but the most high-risk providers will get quotes.  The Taoiseach mentioned it this afternoon.  How many high-risk providers are there in the category?  What are they to do to comply with the rule requiring them to have insurance?  There are committee members from all over the country and more than one of us will end up representing a facility that may not be able to get insurance.  Clearly, that will be a major issue for them over the next couple of days if they learn they cannot get a quote from Allianz.  Could the Minister comment on that?  Those are my prefacing questions for her.  She might answer them, after which Deputy Sherlock will lead members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#C00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Regarding my time, it was to have been approximately an hour had we started a little earlier.

I would answer that in two ways.  My Department has been in regular contact with the broker that was handling the negotiations and we understand some of the issues with which he has been working.  Even as the days pass, other information arises and we are in direct contact with one or two providers that may have access to another insurance operator.  We are having those conversations.  We will examine information specific to the childcare sector in other jurisdictions.  We will consider the question of attracting other operators with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and their officials, given that that is where this issue large resides.  We will provide input based on what we know.  We will also get more information from our providers regarding their 2020 insurance costs.  No one knows all of that information, so we will be asking that question.  The public sector profile, which I launched yesterday or the day before, will be included.

Notwithstanding everything that the Minister is saying and the exit from the market of a certain insurance operator, even where providers' risk profiles have not increased because they have always been compliant as per Child and Family Agency and HSE regulations, their premia costs are increasing.  One is left with the impression that the insurance companies are taking advantage of the lacuna in the market by stepping in to profit from the challenge facing providers.<\/p> <p>  How will the programme support payment be divided?  Is it a one-off payment for every provider?  What formula will be used?  Under what heading will it be done?  Will it be deemed a supplementary payment to meet the cost of overheads?  Will it be a direct grant just by dint of the fact that someone is a provider?  Is it the case that providers can benefit without having to go through a rigorous process?  The Minister will be conscious of the fact that many providers will benefit from the time extension, but as public representatives, we are all conscious that the capital costs incurred by providers to become compliant and continue their operations have put them into debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#D01200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#D01300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>We should not overburden the sector to the extent where facilities are being forced to close because their capital and insurance costs are too high and the &euro;1,500 payment is not enough to meet the challenges they face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#D01400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I am pleased to attend the committee at short notice.  It is not that doing so was not a challenge, but this is the appropriate place to interrogate the issues.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging our efforts.  They will not solve everything, but I hope that they can be solutions in the short term and identify a path towards a mid-term solution.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the programme support payment.  I have decided to offer it from within existing resources.  The cost totals approximately &euro;7 million, which will be spread across the sector.<\/p> <p>  Based on the representations by those we meet and hear from via email, we are aware of the pressure and stress that the sector has been placed under by two major elements this year - going through the re-registration process and getting ready for and becoming part of the national childcare scheme.  I originally initiated the programme support payment to acknowledge and support the additional administrative burdens, and this situation is effectively within that category.  We are fairly confident about how we have decided how much people should get.  The average is &euro;1,500, and the formula is tried and trusted.  We have used it for the programme support payment previously.  It largely has to do with the number of children that a provider has and whether they are cared for part time or full time.  There are a couple of other details, but that is generally how it is determined.  In light of that, there is a range of supports from small to very large.  In addition, if providers still find themselves in grave difficulty, we have in place a case management system that considers sustainability issues.

I am asking these questions myself and we are working through them.  It is important to give a little more fact and detail to help answer them.  Some 3,000 of the 4,600 providers are being covered by the existing insurer and 2,600 of these are part of the insurance scheme organised by Early Childhood Ireland, ECI.  We understand that the great majority of these providers face premia increases of approximately 10% in 2020.  It is important to put this on the record.  I am aware of the significant percentage of increase for some cr&egrave;ches, which the Deputy has referred to and which I will come to in a moment, but it is important to mention the other cr&egrave;ches too.  Some 2,600 of those cr&egrave;ches with the ECI face 10% increases.  Of the other 400 that are insured currently through Allianz, I am informed that they will have an increase in the region of 30%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#E01000","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Did the Minister say 30%?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#E01100","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Yes, 30%.  I understand that the other providers that were insured through Ironshore Europe will face increased in the region of 100%.  We have all received representations that some people are getting quoted more than that.  In general, the latter is the information we have been given.  That is extremely unfortunate.  The information we have is that the issue arises because the policies they had previously been on are not considered to be sustainable and that no insurer can take on a loss-making premium.  Just a few hours ago, I was informed that Allianz has quoted for the 1,015 providers of those who were with Ironshore Europe and is working to offer quotations to virtually all of the other providers.<\/p> <p>  I want to make this a little more concrete and then I will address those larger percentage increases.  We must look at the overall context.  The policies now being offered through the ECI scheme will, for example, typically cost providers between 0.5% and 0.75% of their total turnover.  I will give an example of a cr&egrave;che with 40 children.  If it pays insurance of &euro;60 per child per year, an insurance premium would be in the region of &euro;2,520.  This example is a provider which may not have paid that much before.  If the provider charges an average fee of &euro;800 per month per child it gives the provider a turnover of &euro;384,000, of which the insurance premium represents just 0.65%.  This compares favourably with other sectors.  These numbers demonstrate that the average of the standing insurer is a certain and relatively small percentage of overall turnover.  This is the way the insurance industry operates.  I was also quoted an example of one larger provider, which caters for 800 children, whose premium has risen significantly from &euro;20,000 to &euro;32,000.  Even in this case, however, the cost per child insured has risen from &euro;25 per year to &euro;40 per year.  While this is a significant rise, at 0.26% to 0.4% it is still a small proportion of the provider's turnover.  Having said all of this and while it is important to put it on the record, this is what is happening across the sector.  Clearly, there are cases where the increases are substantially more.  We know this and we hear this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#E01200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

People will get this payment automatically by the 28 December.  They will not have to go and fill in forms or make phone calls.  In the context of those providers for whom this payment is not sufficient, one can find that sometimes people are told to contact Pobal or the city or county childcare committee, but when they do they will not necessarily get the answers that even the Department think they might get.

There is total panic this week.  It always seems to land on the shoulders of the workers and providers in the early years and childcare areas.  They always seem to get the wrong end of everything.  They had to panic about the re-registration and now we hear that Tusla will accept people after the deadline.  This causes stress and worry for people.  There are many examples.  One provider in Donegal has a premium going up from &euro;1,800 to &euro;4,275, which is a huge increase.  In Kilkenny a provider has had a &euro;2,200 increase.  A provider in Tallaght has had a &euro;1,000 increase.  While I welcome the payment support of &euro;1,500, it will be a help for some people but not for others.  We need to know where we can point people if the &euro;1,500 will not cut it.  Otherwise, services will close.  This does not just mean that children will be left without the place they rely on, it also affects parents trying to get to work and it affects the workers working in the area, and especially in rural areas where the local childcare provider may be one of the main employers.  This is very important.  It appears to me that once again the early years and childcare sector is getting the raw end of the stick.  I welcome this meeting and that the Minister came in to us at short notice.  At least it gives some recognition to these people that they are an extremely important sector.

It is important to state that it is an average payment, in light of some of the Deputy's comments.  I am trying to be explicit in responding to what she is saying.  This has been very difficult for people, with incredible stress and lots of pressure.  A substantial portion of it comes from the additional administrative burden.  People accept that the re-registration has to be done but it is the first time re-registration has happened and some aspects of it have changed.  The introduction of the new national childcare scheme is a one-off, hopefully.  That is the reason for the payment support.  It is not to pay insurance, <i>per se<\/i>, it is effectively to acknowledge the pressures and stresses around what has to be done in the year, and especially in an administrative capacity.<\/p><p>The Deputy referred to the figure of &euro;1,500 perhaps not being sufficient.  I suppose it does not really meet all of the increased costs but there are at least two ways in which we offer support.  There is the one-off programme support payment.  If a provider is in an unsustainable position - and I have checked this with my official Ms McNally - then it must contact the local city and county childcare committee or Pobal in the first instance and if it cannot get through to contact us.  If the provider contacts the Department about the matter, we will know it is urgent.  We will ask and we will be back in touch with them because it is an important issue for them.<\/p><p> Going back to the questions on the increase of 300% or even more, if it is causing a sustainability concern or issue, we need to hear from the provider.

If that is &euro;3,000 to &euro;9,000, although I do not know this for a fact, I think that it is a larger childcare provider.

I asked for a definition of the terms \"critical\", \"high\", \"medium\" and \"low\".  It is not the risk ratings, which I also have in my hand.  Risk ratings are where a service has not been reviewed or there are risk notifications taking place.  It is important just to have it noted.  A service that is categorised as \"critical\" has been escalated to the national registrations and enforcement panel, which is the process to remove an unauthorised service.  A service categorised as \"high\" is under deliberation on the management by the panel, which has not advanced to the commencement to removal or prosecution.  We are using these conversation pieces at the moment in respect of critical and high and risk ratings.  That is the barometer for how Tusla the regulator is managing up and down.  It is a fluid system and I take totally on board what Mr. Lee said.  At the same time, they have to have a barometer and that is how they are defining it.

Overall, the sector has been challenging for workers and owners over the last period.  The uncertainty at this time of the year is very stressful.  We all accept that and I am grateful that the Minister agreed to meet us today.<\/p> <p>  On the regulation that was introduced recently, we have given greater powers to Tusla and there has been greater regulation for approximately three years.  Is there a correlation between the increase in insurance prices and the fact that the sector is more highly regulated?  I was asked that question today.<\/p> <p>  The State Claims Agency deals mainly with public services, primarily medical but also some others.  Is there a possibility that in extreme cases some of the liability could be passed on to the State Claims Agency?  In the past, private sector obstetricians could get cover in that way.  It would be worth exploring that for a worst case scenario. <\/p> <p>  As a solicitor, I often deal with insurance defence work so I am very familiar with how insurance companies operate.  Surely the insurance company could offer the same discount to all childcare providers.  I do not see why providers should be precluded from receiving the discount available to members of Early Childhood Ireland.  I do not know how many providers are members of the Early Childhood Ireland.  I know this facility exists in other sectors like the restaurant sector.  Lobby groups are providing a very good service to members by securing such deals.  I cannot get my head around the idea that the insurance companies would not afford the same discount to other providers. <\/p> <p>  To return to a point raised by Deputy Neville, there are numerous insurers and insurance is a very complicated business.  Most of the companies in Ireland operate out of London.  As Ms Corrigan said, the reason the broker system exists is to deal with the nuances and complexities that exist in certain areas.  We should focus on getting more companies to write business in this area because where there is only one provider, that company will hold a huge amount of power.  It is obvious that when brokers deal with these types of businesses on a regular basis they will develop a relationship with a particular insurance company.  This facilitates insurance contracts being executed quickly, etc., but it also leaves the business completely vulnerable, no more than a solicitor's office with one client has all its eggs in one basket.  One must diversify one's business base.  A core issue must be to try to get more insurance companies to write business in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#G02300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator that the challenge and job here is to attract additional insurance companies to provide cover in the childcare sector.

I know all Members will have received emails.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the additional programme support payment and hope that will go some way towards making it a little easier for the firms that the Minister has mentioned are facing an increase of approximately 100% on the premia they were paying.  One of the biggest and most important components of this industry, when we compare what is being done across the board, is the maintenance of databases and the provision of clear information.  It would be very helpful to the Department, Pobal and others to have a central database of premia for the childcare industry.  It would allow those firms compare themselves with others that are of a similar size.  I do not trust the insurance industry.  I do not think anybody in this room does.  It has been telling us porky pies for quite some time.  That is clear from the Central Bank report and other reports.  It would help the childcare industry to have a transparent way of determining what other service providers are paying because there is no existing way for them to do that other than calling and assuming they will get the correct answer.<\/p> <p>  Tusla is doing its job on the regulatory side in ensuring that service providers are up to date.  To go back to one of our previous meetings about the RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" programme and the standards and the reports in the public domain, this emphasises the importance of Tusla's ensuring that those reports are online and available to parents, the public and the insurers.  As we well know, if we give them any excuse, they will up the premium.  In an industry with only one service provider, we have to recognise that we must do everything we can to reduce the excuses that the insurance industry provides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#H02900","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>All of those points are very important.

I am conscious that we are running short on time.  I asked the Minister about meeting the company that withdrew in the context of the need to collect much-needed information.  What was the reason or rationale for its withdrawal?  Do we know whether it related to claims?  Why did the provider in question withdraw?  What needs to change to encourage and incentivise other people into the industry?  I would like to pick up on a comment that the Minister made.  When there is a monopoly, it is a real worry.  People inside the ECI structure are already getting more favourable insurance premiums than people outside that structure.  Where there is a monopoly, there is no competition and there is an opportunity to overcharge.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has said that \"Over the course of the past year to date, there were three parliamentary questions .... tabled to my Department on insurance\".  The dogs on the street have known for the past two years that insurance is crippling business across every sector.  It is at the Minister's door now.  Unfortunately, I do not believe the momentum is there to bring in the necessary reforms.  The Minister will have to ensure the necessary reforms are introduced to incentivise more people into the market.  Although the announcement that has been made today is welcome, it will be no more than a sticking plaster if we do not address this issue by incentivising more providers to enter the market and to bring insurance premiums down.  We should not have to be using tax resources to supplement the insurance industry, but that is what is happening now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019121800002#J01400","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>As I have said on several occasions this afternoon, it is important that we attract at least one more insurance organisation, and preferably a couple of such organisations, into the market.

I have not met them directly, but that is the information I have received from them.  We know from other sources that increases can be higher than that.  We have been told that such increases have arisen because the previous policies were not considered to be sustainable.  The insurer was taking on a loss-making premium.  That is the information we have already received with regard to the insurer that has left.  I think it is correct.<\/p> <p>  I have indicated some of the ways in which we will contribute to the reform work that is being done in the Department of Finance to ensure insurance is available to facilitate the services we need to deliver.  For example, we have information and data from a childcare perspective.  We also know that the seriousness of the issue has not been evident in the childcare sector up to now.  I think this is the case.  We have the information and we are moving forward in this area.  Ironshore was bought out.  There is information to suggest that costs reduced by 40% when it entered the market, although this has yet to be verified.  That may not have been sustainable.  We have some information.

I welcome the opportunity to engage with it on the findings of our review.  I am joined today by Dr. Patrick Walker, deputy lead assessor of the RCOG review.  We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the women or their next of kin who consented to participate in this review.  We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the cytology laboratory at University Hospital Monklands in Scotland and other consultant cytopathologists, the members of the expert panel, including our two lay representatives, and our project manager at the RCOG for assistance throughout this process.<\/p> <p>  After a complex and demanding exercise, the college had met the objectives defined in the terms of reference with the completion of 1,308 individual reports for women or next of kin by October 2019 and the publication of our aggregate report on December 3 2019.  The timing of the final report was dictated by the requirement to ensure that all the women or next of kin had received their individual report prior to the aggregate report being published.  At this point we wish to state how acutely aware we are of the impact that screening failures have had on the lives of affected women and their families.  We would also like to recognise the 103 women in our review who have died, and will neither be able to read their individual reports nor the final RCOG report.  We hope the individual reports will provide some service to next of kin.  <\/p> <p>  The primary purpose of the individual reports was to provide consenting women or next of kin with a transparent and independent analysis of their CervicalCheck cytology slides prior to their diagnosis of cancer, along with an explanation of the findings and an independent conclusion regarding the clinical implications of any discordant result.  Throughout this process, we felt it was of the utmost importance to obtain input from participating women with regard to the content, tone and style of letter that would convey their individual reports.  In May 2019, we met a group of women and one next of kin to discuss our proposed style of letter.  We received broad approval and suggestions, which we adopted.  The group also conveyed a strong message that any women who so wish should have access to an appointment with a health professional to receive their reports.  We were in full agreement and immediately conveyed this to the HSE.  <\/p> <p>  The primary purpose of the final report was to aggregate the findings of the cytology slide review that directly compared the RCOG readings of 1,659 slides with those of CervicalCheck.  By way of background, the slide review panel was comprised of screeners from the University Hospital Monklands cytology centre in Scotland as well as consultant staff actively working in the English NHS cervical screening programme.  The role of the screeners was to identify those slides considered to be negative, that is, showing no abnormality.  All slides considered to show any abnormal results were reviewed by a consultant.  If there was disagreement with the CervicalCheck result, a second consultant read the slides.  If there was disagreement between the first and second consultants, the slides would be viewed by a consensus panel over a multiheaded microscope to arrive at a final result. <\/p> <p>  With regard to process, those reading the slides were always blind to the CervicalCheck result.  However, for reasons laid out in the report, seeding the slides blindly among routine day-to-day laboratory work would have been impracticable.  We believe our methods were thorough and produced reliable results.  In both the report and in explanatory notes to each participant, we have acknowledged that in a slide review of this type the detection of abnormalities will be enhanced.  Our role was not to assess the performance of the CervicalCheck laboratories but to inform women whether or not the review had found that abnormal cells had been missed.  In those cases where there was discordance between the CervicalCheck and the RCOG review, the college sought to determine whether this had impacted on the clinical outcome in terms of failure to prevent cancer or diagnose it at an earlier stage.<\/p><p>This was done by the expert panel determining the likely quantum of delay in the diagnosis of cancer engendered by missing abnormal cells, or undercalling cells in terms of grade, and applying this quantum to a set protocol of time intervals and stage diagnosis.<\/p><p> The RCOG expert panel felt the individual letters should include not only the results of the slide review but also the effect any discordant reading had on a delay in diagnosis.  In the majority of cases, the expert panel considered there was no such effect but in half of the discordant cases the panel concluded there had been a missed opportunity to prevent or diagnose at an earlier stage.  We applied scrutiny to those cases where prolonged colposcopy management was identified and found that in a quarter of such cases colposcopy management was suboptimal, sometimes further complicated by discordant cytology and sometimes not.<\/p><p> The slide review formed the basis of providing women with individual reports.  The thoroughness and quality of the review combined with full disclosure of the findings means women can have confidence in their individual reports.  The expert panel made it absolutely clear that these reports are not a judgment with respect to medical negligence and that such a matter would require others to determine.  An explanatory note to this effect was included with the individual reports.  This compilation of individual reports disclosing the findings and implications, together with an aggregate report based on a point in time slide review of more than 1,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer, is, as far as the authors can determine, unique in scale and scope.  It represents a transparent approach that others can reference and with which future comparison can be made.<\/p><p> We chose to compare our slide review findings with the English audit, which is the only other published large-scale slide review conducted as part of a national cervical screening protocol.  Both involved slides of liquid-based cytology and both involved the slides being reviewed in the knowledge that cancer had been the outcome.  The intention was to determine whether the findings of the RCOG review represented an outlier or was in line with what might be expected.  In the event, it was the latter.  The findings of the RCOG review were striking in the sense that a high proportion of discordant readings were found, many with significant implications.  However, this was not unexpected, not only because similar discordant rates were found in the English NHS cervical cancer audit but also because the natural history of cervical cancer indicates that it is highly probable the cervix would have shed abnormal cells for a number of years prior to the diagnosis of cancer, whether it was screen detected or not.<\/p><p> Our review, therefore, illustrates the limitations of cervical cytology rather than pointing to a screening service that falls below what might be expected.  Data published by National Cancer Registry Ireland shows falling incidence and deaths from cervical cancer since CervicalCheck was established in 2008.  These endpoints are the cardinal signs of effective cervical screening.  The findings of our review back this up, with a high proportion of early-stage cancer identified in the review cohort, which indicates that screening undoubtedly saved the lives of many women in the review.<\/p><p> To address concerns expressed regarding the verification process of finalising individual reports, we have submitted a detailed statement to the committee.  When these concerns were initially raised with us in October, we offered to meet participants and patient representatives and came to Dublin to outline the process in detail and answer any questions.  In a complex and demanding exercise involving more than 1,000 women and 20,000 individual data items, including 3,300 smear results, we acknowledge there is capacity for error.  As we note in the statement, in a very small number of cases, totalling fewer than five, it has been necessary to issue supplementary reports because new information came to light, and in two of these cases the conclusion was updated.  While these isolated incidents are regrettable they in no way impact the overall conclusions or recommendations laid out in our aggregate report.<\/p><p> We would be concerned if unfounded criticism of our evidence-based report undermined trust in our findings and confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.  This could have the effect of diminishing coverage, which could only place more lives at risk.  It is very important that the benefits of cervical screening in the existing programme are accurately portrayed in terms of public health.  Vaccination against human papilloma virus was introduced in Ireland for early adolescent girls in 2010 and for adolescent boys this year.  As already demonstrated in Australia and Scotland, where screening begins at 20, with high coverage this could reduce considerably the incidence of abnormal smears and, therefore, pre-cancer in young women and will result in a further reduction in deaths from cervical cancer.<\/p><p> We believe the RCOG review has provided all eligible women with open disclosure of their slide review and has provided an aggregate picture of the overall result.  Our conclusion that the CervicalCheck programme is working in terms of effectiveness, cytology and colposcopy is supported by incidents in mortality data published by National Cancer Registry Ireland, which demonstrates year-on-year falls since 2010 following the establishment of the CervicalCheck programme.  The premier objectives in cervical screening are being met and our report should restore trust in cervical screening in Ireland.  With high coverage, the CervicalCheck programme, which will soon incorporate primary HPV testing, combined with the impact of high coverage vaccination, should ensure that cervical cancer prevention in Ireland will become as good as it can be and cervical cancer deaths should eventually decline to the point where they become a rarity.<\/p><p> We were privileged to have been tasked with undertaking this important piece of work, which we hope will have benefited the women who participated in the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Henry Kitchener","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The committee was disappointed we did not get Dr. Holohan's opening statement until 9 a.m. today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#C00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>My apologies for that.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it this morning.  I am pleased to update it on the outcome of the independent expert panel review of CervicalCheck, and we have just heard some of the details, which we established last year following the Government's decision of May, and the current position on the national screening programme as it pertains.  I am joined by Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, Dr. Ronan Glynn, the deputy chief medical officer and Ms Celeste O'Callaghan, principal officer.<br\/><br\/>As we know, the failure to disclose the results of the CervicalCheck retrospective audit to women and families, which emerged in April last year, resulted in widespread concern about the programme.  Since then, the Department's overriding priority has been to ensure the viability and sustainability of our national cervical screening programme so it can continue to save lives and improve outcomes for cervical cancer.<br\/><br\/>Neither screening nor HPV vaccination alone are enough and we need both to work together in tandem if we are to make cervical cancer a rare disease in Ireland, which is our policy objective.  In pursuit of this goal, the Department has engaged very closely with the HSE and, in particular, the national screening service on the implementation of the various Government decisions and the range of very difficult strategic and operational issues faced by the programme.<br\/><br\/>It is important to recognise, however, that this work has involved multiple other stakeholders coming together and working collectively through the many challenges that arise, as well as those who continue to deliver the service in a hugely pressurised environment.  This includes patient advocates, patient representatives and clinicians.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the commitment, input and expertise of each of them.  Most particularly, I thank the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which, at our request, agreed to undertake what has been an enormously complex and challenging task to give individual women in the first instance, or their next of kin, the opportunity to have the benefit of expert independent assurance with regard to their individual cases.<br\/><br\/>Over the past 18 months, we have moved from a period of crisis to an emerging more stable environment.  The necessary laboratory capacity has been secured to ensure continuation of the programme following complex negotiations led by the HSE.  Recruitment for key posts that will strengthen the governance of the screening service has been undertaken and investment is ongoing in the development of national laboratory capacity, colposcopy services and the introduction of HPV primary immunisation, to add to the introduction of HPV immunisation for boys during the course of 2019.<br\/><br\/>From the perspective of women and families involved in this issue, an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme to address the issue of non-disclosure was put in place as well as a package of health and social care supports.<\/p><p>In the past 18 months, we have had two independent reviews of the programme: the scoping inquiry initially led by Dr. Scally, which concluded earlier this year, and now the independent expert panel review led by RCOG, which concluded two weeks ago.  Dr. Scally provided the final report in September of last year and a supplementary report in May of this year.  He found no evidence of deficiencies in screening quality but he did identify a significant number of management and governance issues and made a total of 58 recommendations to address these.  A comprehensive implementation plan was developed in late 2018 for these actions with approximately 170 actions across the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland.  Significant progress has been made overall with in excess of two thirds of these actions now completed.  That is in the oversight of the CervicalCheck steering group.  Quarterly progress reports on this are published on the website of the Department of Health.  <\/p><p> Patient representatives make a significant contribution on an ongoing basis to the work of the Department, the HSE and health agencies, and the patient voice has been central to our work, not just in respect of CervicalCheck but all of our work in the past 18 months.  Patient representatives have been active participants in the CervicalCheck steering committee chaired by the Department and contributed significant time also to working with the HSE in regard to the many operational issues arising over the past year and a half that the executive is grappling with.  <\/p><p> Ms Lorraine Walsh resigned from her work on the steering committee and with individuals and committees in the HSE and CervicalCheck at the end of October.  The Minister has thanked her for all of her work.  Her significant input to the work of the steering committee since its inception was acknowledged at its November meeting.  We have the opportunity now to acknowledge that and thank her for the work she has done with us during the course of that committee.  The Department is examining how best to provide necessary structures that will allow for appropriate selection and compensation policies to be put in place to ensure that patient representatives are appropriately recognised and remunerated for their work and contribution to health service design and reform.  International models of patient representation are being examined as part of this work, which is at an advanced stage.  <\/p><p> On 3 December, the aggregate report of the international clinical panel review was published following the Government decision taken that day.  The first key objective of the review was to provide women, or their next of kin, with independent clinical assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment.  In total, 1,038 women chose to participate in the review and this was a very welcome number, which allowed robust and comprehensive analysis of the programme.  The process of communicating individual reports to women or their next of kin commenced in late September.  All of those who wished to do so have now received a report at an individual level setting out the reports findings.  We were keen to ensure that individuals in the first instance have the opportunity to hear from their individual clinician before any aggregate report could be published.  <\/p><p> There is no doubt that this has been a difficult process for many women or their next of kin particularly where, sadly, a woman may have died.  The Department has engaged closely through this process with the HSE in its planning for a communication process that is as sensitive and supportively delivered as possible.  We recognise the significant work that has been undertaken by the HSE, including the clinical need for the national women and infants programme and the engagement of colposcopists in particular on whom we are enormously dependent to support this process around the country. <\/p><p> The second key objective of the review was to publish the aggregate report, which includes recommendations, where appropriate, that have the aim of improving care for women.  In that context, the concern that first arose in April of last year was an important dimension of the work of the independent panel and adds to the work undertaken by the separate scoping inquiry reported on by Dr. Scally.  Based on its overall findings the expert panel has stated, and it is important to reiterate, that it is not an understatement to say for many women who participated in this review screening undoubtedly has saved their lives; that there is no doubt that the programme has been successful and has worked effectively; that women can have confidence in the CervicalCheck programme; and that their findings at a population level are in line with those seen in the English cervical screening programme and should not be viewed as a cause for concern with respect to the population overall.  We regard these conclusions as very welcome given the importance of cervical screening from a public health point of view.  We know it saves lives and it is vital, therefore, that women have confidence in the programme.  The public can be reassured that the programme is operating effectively now.  As we know, the panel has made ten recommendations, which generally align with the work being undertaken in both organisations, the HSE, and the Department, including in regard to the recommendations of Dr. Scally.  The Minister has written to the HSE and the National Cancer Registry in respect of the implementation of those recommendations.  The independent panel's report also concluded that many of the women who participated in the review are alive today because of CervicalCheck.  That conclusion underlines once again the crucial importance of ensuring a strong, viable and sustainable cervical screening programme while working to ensure that cervical cancer becomes a rare disease in Ireland, an objective we all share.  <\/p><p> The expert panel and Dr. Scally said that through a combination of screening and vaccination together with good uptake of both we can achieve this goal.  The extension of the HPV vaccine to boys in September of this year and the introduction of HPV primary screening in quarter 1 next year are key steps towards that goal.  Funding for both was provided in 2019.  We will continue to engage closely with the HSE on its continued roll-out and implementation.  <\/p><p> In addition, the focus remains on the continued implementation of the recommendations of the scoping inquiry and the implementation of the ten recommendations contained in the RCOG report.  Through the combined effects of all these elements, we will have the opportunity to ensure that Ireland has a world class cervical cancer screening programme that will enable us to make cervical cancer a rare disease within a generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I am joined by Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer in the HSE, Dr. Lorraine Doherty, clinical director for CervicalCheck, Ms Celine Fitzgerald,  interim CEO for the national screening service and Dr. Peter McKenna, the clinical director for the women and infants programme.  We continue to address and manage all issues that have arisen in the programme since April 2018.  The briefing submitted in advance of the meeting to the committee updates it on these key areas of priority.<\/p> <p>  Our information line and client services unit continues to provide information to women and their families.  We also support women and their families in the provision of access to their records and ensuring women get their slides from laboratories where required for legal review.  The client services unit continues to support this process and we have provided healthcare records to 665 women and slides to 388 women, families or their representatives.  We continue to support the 221+ group through our community liaison officers who support women and their families with the provision of the support packages following the Government decision of May 2018.  We also work closely with the 221+ patient representatives across a wide range of areas and are very grateful for their guidance and input to the screening programmes.  It is helping to make a real difference.  We have just completed a patient and public inclusion plan for screening services.  This was developed in conjunction with our patient representatives and was recently launched.  We are very grateful to the three lead patient representatives who are part of the team.  Some key actions within the plan include appointment of a full-time patient inclusion officer, extension of the screening patient panel, patients on key committees and a model for patient inclusion.  We also have patient representatives on the HSE steering group for screening, Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh, and would like to acknowledge the work of Lorraine Walsh, who recently stepped down from the HSE steering group.  Despite her own difficult illness, Lorraine has been an invaluable and supportive patient advocate and has been key in making the changes necessary to sustain cervical screening in this country.  The HSE would like to formally thank her and wish her well in the future.  <\/p> <p>  The HSE has contributed significantly to the development of an implementation plan in collaboration with other State agencies in response to the Scally scoping inquiry recommendations.  An oversight group was established in the HSE with a senior manager appointed to support and ensure continued implementation of the Scally report.  At the end of November, a total of 95 actions have been completed by the HSE from a total of 116 within the overall plan with the remainder in progress.  Examples of progress to date include key appointments, governance improvements in the national screening service and CervicalCheck, an organisational review of risk management structures has been completed and a report setting out a revised approach to risk management across the organisation has been approved by the HSE board.  A review of the HSE's healthcare record management policy is also due to conclude shortly.<\/p> <p>  One of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations included setting out the future approach to interval cancer audit.  The HSE established an oversight group for this project with expert groups.  The expert groups are independently chaired and comprise patients, patient advocates, patient ethicists, screening clinicians and international experts.  The expert groups have considered international best practice as part of the scope and the work continues to be progressed with a target to complete early in 2020.  The recommendations of the RCOG aggregate report in relation to interval cancer audit will now be incorporated in this work.  An interim revision of the HSE open disclosure policy was published in June 2019 and the HSE remains committed to ensuring the operation of open disclosure throughout the organisation by continuing to roll out its national training programme through the national open disclosure office.  An open disclosure governance steering group chaired by the national director for quality improvement continues to provide the governance and the oversight to the operation of open disclosure throughout the HSE.  The governance framework in the group will provide leadership for the evaluation of the audit of compliance with the policy.<\/p><p>All recommendations for procurement have now been implemented and the HSE also continues to work with medical training bodies in developing an open disclosure in communication skills training programme.  <br\/><br\/>Turnaround times for the reporting of results are now running at an average of six weeks.  We hope to sustain the turnaround times at this level going forward.  This will ensure that women and their GPs get their results in a reasonable time period, which is one of the key performance indicators for the programme.<br\/><br\/>The key risk to enable cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.  The HSE reached agreement with both the Coombe and Quest to enable continuity of the programme.  The development of the national cervical screening laboratory was included in our recent HSE capital plan and will enable a better balance between public and private laboratory capacity provision.  A project steering group and team are now in place with building and workforce plans developed.  Additional support has been procured to enable the project to be accelerated as much as possible.  The new laboratory is already at the planning stage.  While we are planning for a rapid build programme, it will still take a number of years to implement, primarily due to the challenge of retaining and recruiting suitably qualified staff.  This challenge cannot be underestimated in our environment. <br\/><br\/>Hospital colposcopy services remain under pressure with increased referrals and the requirement for increased consultation time.  The HSE women and infants programme has recently completed an impact assessment on hospital colposcopy services that identified some immediate resource requirements.  Funding was included in the 2019 national service plan and this was rolled out to the clinics to support additional service sessions, to increase capacity and improve waiting times.  We continue to work with the hospital colposcopy clinics and a joint working group between the national women and infants programme, acute hospitals and CervicalCheck has been established to support this process. <br\/><br\/>The programme, after a long search, has just appointed a national colposcopy adviser.  While we have secured support from our hospital colposcopy services on particular projects, this has been a significant gap over the last year. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>We are continuing to implement our plan to introduce HPV primary screening.  A project team has been in place since last year and there are seven work streams involved in the project.  We remain committed to implementing HPV primary screening, with the target for implementation in the first quarter of 2020. <br\/><br\/>Since we last appeared before the committee, we have reduced some of the major risks to the project through the reduction in the backlog and securing laboratory providers who can provide the testing service.  The implementation project, however, remains complex, with a number of risks which we continue to actively manage including IT system changes, laboratory preparedness and to ensure sufficient availability of colposcopy services to address future demand from HPV primary screening. <br\/><br\/>The introduction of the HPV vaccine for boys in September 2019 combined with the existing uptake of the HPV vaccine by girls will help reduce incidences of cervical cancer and other cancers.  Evidence from elsewhere in the world shows that this combination of HPV vaccine and HPV primary screening will have the impact of eliminating cervical cancer over the next two to three decades and in the shorter term, ensuring that women present with earlier disease and are much less likely to progress to cancer.<br\/><br\/>While recruitment and retention of staff remains a challenge for our screening services, we have made significant progress.  We have completed a review of the organisational design of the national screening service and one of the key actions was the appointment of a permanent CEO.  The permanent CEO position within the national screening service has been advertised and an interim CEO for screening services is in place while we recruit a permanent CEO for the service. <br\/><br\/>In addition, we have appointed a permanent quality and risk manager for screening services and have filled additional new posts in quality and risk management.  A deputy laboratory co-ordinator is now in place to strengthen the laboratory capacity in the programme. <br\/><br\/>We have recently appointed a CervicalCheck programme manager and are concluding the recruitment of a deputy CervicalCheck programme manager.  A CervicalCheck colposcopy adviser has just been appointed and we are continuing to progress the recruitment of a CervicalCheck primary care adviser and colposcopy nurse, which will further strengthen the clinical input to the programme.  We have also recruited a permanent director of public health for the screening service and continue to make efforts in recruiting public health specialists to support the work of the director.  This will strengthen the public health input to the programme.  Posts in communications and HR have also been advertised, in addition to a number of other programme support roles.  We will ensure that the recruitment of all posts from the service workforce plan continues to be prioritised. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The HSE provided support to the independent international expert panel review undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, RCOG, which was established by the Minister for Health, following a Government decision for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HSE supported the consent process, established a national help desk, developed an eligible data set with the national cancer registry, implemented a client management system to support RCOG, co-ordinating the release of slides and medical records to RCOG and supported the provision of individual reports to women.  <br\/><br\/>The HSE put a verification process in place to ensure that an anonymised report went to the correct woman for whom the HSE held her name and address.  This was an administrative process to ensure that the right report went to the right woman.  All women, or their next of kin, who wished to do so have now received their individual report.  Throughout the process of communicating individual reports, the HSE&rsquo;s focus has been on ensuring this is done as appropriately and sensitively as possible.  <br\/><br\/>The aggregate report was published following the Government meeting of Tuesday, 3 December and provided further assurance about the quality of the cervical screening programme.  It contained ten recommendations which are being incorporated into our existing overall implementation plan.  The report&rsquo;s key findings included that there was as expected a high proportion of very early screen detected cancer, which has saved many lives and concluded that the CervicalCheck programme was working effectively. <br\/><br\/>The review did find for a number of women a discordance with their original CervicalCheck results and RCOG set out the reasons for this in their aggregate report.  We are conscious of how difficult it has been for many women and their families who were part of the review.  The HSE will continue to provide meetings where required and an information line for those women and families who were part of the review.  We will continue to provide this support for people impacted by the review. <br\/><br\/>Overall, the conclusion of the RCOG review is another milestone for the programme.  It completes a major programme of operational support and provides welcome assurance about screening quality as we continue to stabilise and strengthen our screening services.  I want to assure members that the HSE is absolutely focused on ensuring these important public health programmes continue to save lives.  All possible resources are being directed at this challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>That concludes the opening statements of our witnesses.

I have a lot to get through.  I want to say to our guests from RCOG, the Department of Health and the HSE that we have a serious issue when the lady who commenced all of this, Vicky Phelan, says she has no confidence in this report.  The two patient advocates who were before the committee last night also said they have no confidence in this report.  That is their opinion and they aired it intensely and publicly and that is before all of the information that they have has been made public.  Those people cannot put some of that information out into the public forum because there are individual cases involved etc., but that is deeply worrying.  <\/p> <p>  The testimony of Lorraine Walsh yesterday was also deeply worrying.  I will not get into it, but I would like the representatives of the Department of Health to reflect on what she said before the committee.  I want to get the best for everyone out of this and am, and will continue to be, as big an advocate as anyone for improving our screening programme.  The harrowing testimony we heard yesterday was upsetting.  It is something I will reflect on, in whatever role I have, in the future.<\/p> <p>  Professor Kitchener referred to unfounded criticism in his opening statement and I thought that an unfortunate choice of phrase because the criticism that has been forthcoming, particularly from Ms Walsh, has been fully documented and sent to us.  While Professor Kitchener may not believe that there are overt issues, there is certainly validity in, and direct evidence of, some of those criticisms.  I have correspondence from Professor Kitchener in which he apologised for failings.<\/p> <p>  We only received Dr. Holohan's opening statement this morning.  That is a tactic used by a number of individuals - not necessarily Dr. Holohan - of which I am getting tired.  I was taken by the fact that Dr. Holohan's statement did not reflect that, although progress has been made and I have no doubt about that, we have also had major issues.  I ask our guests to read the statement of Stephen Teap yesterday because, in about three paragraphs, he summed up all the issues.  The Taoiseach has apologised on behalf of the people of Ireland for what happened.<\/p><p>Even Dr. Scally's recommendations have not all been implemented.  It is not all rosy in the garden.  Dr. Holohan's opening statement did not proportionately reflect that we still have a range of issues, which is of concern.<br\/><br\/>These are the terms of reference for RCOG.  Terms of reference are very important.  We are here to discuss RCOG.  These were individual reports for all the women.  We have had the first and second Scally reports.  We know what we need to do and we know the recommendations.  We needed an aggregated report statistically from RCOG, as is listed here - nothing more and nothing less.  Some people have jumped to take certain findings out of that which were not part of this and I am not sure are helpful.<br\/><br\/>Professor Kitchener said today that some people have an issue with the credibility of the reporting.  Let me say this straight: I agree with many people.  I have no issue with RCOG's clinical analysis.  My issues relate to the reporting and statistical management - how all those data have been managed.  I also have an issue with the process by which data have been shared, the reporting mechanism and whether the crosschecking of databases has been accurate.  Professor Kitchener said that among all these women there have been fewer than five supplementary reports and two cases where the conclusion has been updated.<br\/><br\/>Let us start at the beginning.  On 21 November, Professor Kitchener said:<\/p><blockquote>\tFollowing last Friday's alert regarding a partial report [I will get back to the phrase &quot;partial report&quot; in a while] we conducted an investigation to ensure all of the results had been uploaded on our database.  I am writing to confirm there was no other valid slide result from batch 35 or indeed any other batch that has not been uploaded on to our database. <\/blockquote><p>Therefore, there was one issue on 21 November.  Following on from that Damien McCallion, who was complimented extensively by those who appeared yesterday evening, as was the HSE - I want to acknowledge that, wrote to Lorraine Walsh on 3 December and stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tI want to make you aware that I know that RCOG have confirmed that no other women were affected by the issue which affected your initial report last Friday, which you have spoken about quite publicly and that that came in yesterday. <\/blockquote><p>Therefore, we have confirmation again on 3 December.<br\/><br\/>Lorraine Walsh appeared on &quot;Prime Time&quot; on 3 December and an unsolicited email came into the programme.  The unsolicited email was from Emma Gilgunn-Jones who is director of media and public relations for RCOG.  It stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn order to ensure the correct letter was sent to the correct patient using the standard format ...  For three women, supplementary reports were issued because new information came to light.  In only one of these cases was the conclusion updated. <\/blockquote><p>Therefore, we have now gone from one to three where only one case was updated.  Today we have five supplementary reports and two cases where it was updated.  The pattern is increasing all the time.  Statistically I know the number of women involved.  However, why was this information not available initially?  Why has this been updated again today?  It is a cause of concern. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#E00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I propose that we get some responses to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#F00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I have just one supplementary question.  In the report regarding Lorraine Walsh's issue, which is public which is why we talk about it, it stated that as part of this process there was verification.  We all know there was a whole range of reports done by RCOG which had to be sent by the HSE back to all the women.  At one phase maybe 40% were sent through.  All the databases were checked and in the case of Lorraine Walsh, her slide had been reviewed.  If she had not come back - in fairness to Damien McCallion and others in the HSE - to this day we would not have got a second report.  That is where the issue is here.  It was only because she knew what she was talking about that the HSE was in a position to send two fantastic ladies down to her 24 hours later.

He might take notes and then respond.  I want his opinions on these three questions; I am not trying to catch him out.  First, I do not understand how we did not have three categories of slides and, on reflection and having read the report, the panel really would have been better off if that had been the case.  The idea that where slides were not available - reports were issued to women to say that they were concordant - is an error.  The panel should reflect on that, and I say so genuinely.  I can see why the reviewers did what they did, but there should have been three categories, namely, concordant, discordant and unknown or whatever other name the panel might wish to give it.  When a slide is not available, one cannot give an assurance to women that it is concordant.  Based on the date and information, that is the conclusion to which the reviewers came, but, in reality, the slide was not available.  For future reference, and in this scenario, I am arguing that this was an error.  I say that genuinely because several people have come to me and made that argument and a lot us who have reflected on the matter would agree with it.  I am interested in Professor Kitchener's opinion in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the answers to my other questions.  Again, I am seeking Professor Kitchener's opinions on these points.  My second question relates to the cervical screening programme in Britain.  The quality statement in respect of the 2018-2019 programme, which was published on 21 November 2019, states: \"There is generally no accepted or expected level of false negative in the NHS Cervical Screening Programme.\"  On page 11 of the RCOG report it is stated that a 30% false negative rate is an international standard.  For the public watching and for confidence levels generally, how do we extrapolate and correlate those two statements?  I am asking this question because it seems to be a real issue for people.<\/p> <p>  My final question is a follow-up to my second question.  Ms Marie Culliton, a past president of the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine has stated her view that if some slides which are unavailable for review are classified as concordant, then the 30% rate for negative readings subsequently reclassified as showing high-grade changes has to be incorrect.  In other words, the percentage is possibly higher.  Does Professor Kitchener agree or disagree with Ms Culliton?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#G01000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Walker to address the first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Henry Kitchener"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The Deputy suggested that the slides should have been allocated to three categories.

They are very important as individuals.  That is my point - that what we were doing was writing an individual letter to an individual woman about her individual circumstances.  Those women who came under the partial report category do not form a homogeneous group.  There were cases where a report was unavailable because it could not be shipped over.  Some of those reports later became available, as we know.  There were cases where the slides were missing and could not be located by the laboratories to be sent over.  I would have to check the data but I think I am right in saying in three cases designated as partial, it was because the report was \"inadequate\" or smear-reporting category P1.  This was not a homogeneous group where one could say that all the cases could be put in one basket.  However, I take the Deputy's point.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the concordant issue, there may be a slight misunderstanding.  Some women had multiple slides in the review.  So, a woman could have an unavailable or missing slide and we would never make any comment on whether that slide was in agreement or disagreement.  However, if she had another slide that reviewed as showing high-grade changes, that smear was concordant.  In writing the individual letter to the woman, those terms were explained in the narrative, but there would not be a circumstance that an unavailable or missing slide was categorised as concordant or discordant.  A letter would outline information in that regard if a concordant slide had been reported and was part of the patient's entire history.

We then have the remarkable coincidence of that happening to prominent campaigners.  That is definitely a remarkable coincidence and even that is a massive understatement.  Mr. McCallion referred to difficulties with recruiting and retaining staff.  He said that this remains a challenge.  We have had some discussion on this.  Mr. McCallion will know my view, from this and other forums, with regard to the outsourcing.  I have raised the issue consistently.  Indeed, I raised it ten or 11 years ago.  Obviously, some of those labs do not exist any more but I have been trying to get some kind of information about whether there is a quality issue with regard to some of the labs used.  I have been told I can get it but it seems very difficult to do so, considering that Dr. Scally could not and that some of these labs have closed down.<\/p> <p>  I am firmly of the view that the best way to proceed is to do all of the testing on this island.  That is my own view and the view of my party.  I have expressed it on many occasions.  I understand that moves are being made to repatriate this work.  Notwithstanding the fact that recruitment remains a challenge - which is again a very nice way of putting it and I would say that it is extremely difficult to recruit and retain people - what work is being done to upskill people?  One cannot just flick a switch and get qualified staff.  They need to be in training now.  I am not convinced there is a plan in place to repatriate this work but, if there is, students will be studying at the moment to take up these positions.  Young people at home will be looking at their CAO forms with a view to taking up a new course or an additional course.  What is the position in that regard?

A small number, two to three, are filled.  I can confirm the exact numbers.  Interviews have been held as recently as yesterday.  Small numbers have come through.  They are a combination of medical scientist posts.  In growing the capacity of the Coombe, bearing in mind that capacity is very small, logistics, IT and so on are very important.  It is much more than the building.  In this instance, the building is the easier part.  We have a joint steering group with the Coombe.  There are a number of elements to that.  It deals with workforce issues.  There is a workforce plan as to what is needed and how to develop in the short and long terms.<\/p> <p>  With regard to recruiting medical scientists, which is one of the challenges, there has been a global shortage of cytologists.  With the move to HPV testing, there are fewer career opportunities and people are less interested in doing it.  That is one of the challenges that compounds our environmental factors.  With regard to medical consultants, we have one permanent consultant.  To grow the service to the extent we hope to, we will need to recruit into it.  We have had interviews.  We have had some success in attracting candidates to at least the interview stage.  We will have to see, as it is with medical consultants, whether we can bring those home with the Coombe.  We are more hopeful with regard to support roles such as laboratory aides and administrative staff.  We can attract people for these roles but there are big challenges on the medical and medical scientist side.  We have really struggled.<\/p> <p>  Retention of staff is equally important.  We have to consider the age profile of the existing staff.  It is a small team which works very hard and which has worked very hard over recent years, which have been difficult for the team due to the volume of work and targets to be met.  The Coombe has an arrangement with an institute of technology.  It provides basic undergraduate training for medical scientists to train them in cytopathology.  We have managed to attract two people into the programme for next year.  It has been quite difficult.  There are attractive opportunities for medical scientists in both private and public environments.  The Coombe has done work with the institutes of technology in that regard.  We will be starting small.  If we can get more people, we will seek to grow but it is quite challenging to attract people from the third level sector into that medical scientist area.  <\/p> <p>  Separately, we are recruiting internationally.  We are trying to attract people from the UK as its health service moves from cytology-based screening to HPV-based screening.  There may be some people who would be prepared to relocate for various reasons.  That is a market at which we are actively looking.  My point is that, whether we recruit people or train people, this is going to take time.  It will get a little bit easier as we move to the new testing model.  There are also discussions with the likes of the National Virus Reference Laboratory with regard to collaboration on this new model.

In the breast screening programme, for example, the aim is to keep the recall rate below 7%.  Otherwise, they are over-referring patients who are otherwise healthy, coming in to a screening programme, volunteering their time to partake in a screening programme for interventions and investigations which may be harmful.  Every screening programme calibrates between the need to pick up as many precancerous changes or early cancer changes in the case of breast cancer against the risk of over referring people.  In the case of the cervical screening programme, for every 1,000 women screened, there are 20 abnormal findings of which the liquid-based cytology picks up 15, but once we move to HPV screening, that will improve to 18, as it is a much more sensitive screening test than cervical cytology.

There would have been recommendations around that.  Going forward, with the advent of the new national screening committee, that will also help in terms of looking at that for future testing or major changes to existing programmes.  The timing would have been evidence-based in terms of whether one does three years and then how one deals with individual cases.

It has expertly trained staff who are participating in formal education and CPD programmes.  It has standardised quality measures right across the five laboratories that provide the service for us.  It has meetings with us on a weekly basis by teleconference and we have face to face meetings four times a year.

It is very useful and it can be used to good effect in the future to restore that vital confidence in the system.  Once we have that, the women who have tests in this country will certainly have confidence in the system.  We are very sorry about the kind of pressure that the system had to work under over the last few years.  It is difficult to be under the microscope all the time, and to be criticised all the time.  It is difficult to restore any confidence in the system while that scrutiny is going on.  It is also difficult to retain staff in that system.  The confrontational nature of the business and the politics surrounding it is such that it puts pressure on a lot of people, in an area that can have its own sensitive pressures at the same time.  We recognise that, but we also recognise the things that we have to do to address the issues.  I refer to the weakness in the system and where the system went wrong and failed to deliver, reassure, and inform women.  This goes back to full and frank information and full disclosure.  This is hugely important, Chairman.

It arose out of evidence that we received last night, but it is something that has been on our minds as we have assessed this over the past 18 months.  I refer to the balance of risk in relation to screening programmes.  We understand that there is an inherent high rate of missing early changes of cervical cancer, pre-cancerous changes, and we understand that this is a problem with most screening programmes.  As Dr. Henry said, 15 out of 20 will be picked up, but five will not.  When one goes through the balancing of risk of a screening programme, there are instances where one looks at a slide and there is no evidence of pre-cancerous changes, even though there may be but they have not been picked up on the slide, there are instances where changes are not picked up but are evident and there are instances where major changes are not picked up.<\/p> <p>  As one moves through that gradiation, is there now a rebalancing of the risk?  The witnesses last night felt that there are inherent deficiencies in screening, but CervicalCheck was outside those inherent risks.  In other words, the programme was deficient.  Is that rebalancing down to the limitations of screening, and ensuring that the programme is not adding a greater risk because it is in some way deficient?  Is that being rebalanced at the moment?  Is the programme now running at a rate efficient to the maximum of the limitations of screening?<\/p> <p>  When we invite healthy people in to have a service, for instance, screening, should there not be a no-fault compensation scheme for people damaged by the failures of the system?  Might that encourage more people to come forward, because 20% of women are not being screened, for whatever reason.  It may not be because they do not have confidence in the screening but rather because they just do not engage.  If there was a no-fault compensation scheme in place, would that alleviate a lot of the anxiety that has developed over the last 18 months?  Perhaps the three main witnesses this could comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#M00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I will address the first part of the Chairman's question.  The RCOG review gives substantial insight and evidence into the answer to the question that the Chairman is asking.  The limitations of screening was spoken about last night and there are many and varied reasons that explain the screening programme not identifying, failing to pick up on and, in about 30% of cases, failing to prevent cancers.  The reasons for that can be very different, and the Chairman will be aware of this.  They can be everything from the chain in terms of the issuing of call and recalls, and there could be errors there even before one gets to screening, the adequacy of the smear itself, the mounting on slides, and then ultimately, the cytology.  We have heard a lot about the cytology all the way through to colposcopic diagnosis and so on.<\/p> <p>  It is true to say that where one sets the balance of risk and benefit ultimately determines the levels, broadly speaking, regarding false positives and false negatives.  For most types of medical tests, not just screening, there is always a balance between the two.  As Dr. Henry said, we can set the balance at a certain level which means we are over-diagnosing, we are over-treating, and exposing people to genuine harm, because over-treating means unnecessary drugs, unnecessary surgery, unnecessary time in hospital, exposure to infection and so on.  All of those things have to be calibrated, and that constant calibration is an issue for all forms of medical test, but we have the best evidence that we have had in relation to the operation of our screening programme through what RCOG has done for us.  On a dynamic basis, the programme would have to have its own quality assurance ranges into the future that continue to provide that assurance, but I will defer to colleagues who wish to supplement what I have said in relation to that.  <\/p> <p>  On the specific issue of no-fault compensation, the committee will be aware that the Department is soon to receive the final report of Mr. Justice Meenan, who is giving consideration to the whole question of compensation.  He was asked specifically how it might be applied in relation to vaccination.  The point that the Chairman makes is a fair one.  As part of the overall consideration of whatever recommendations Mr. Justice Meehan will make, it may form one of the considerations as to how that might operate, how that might facilitate the objectives of a population-based programme in the same way as it might in relation to something like immunisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Holohan saying that the balancing of risk is a dynamic assessment that is changing all the time, and that we should be looking at the programme and improving it as it progresses?

The inherent limits of sensitivity that cytology screening has is the reason women are invited every three years.  We know that - to use Dr. Henry's figure that one quarter of the abnormalities are not picked up in one screen - because the natural history of cancer of the cervix endures over a number of years, the hope is that they will be picked up in a subsequent screen.  Repeated screening, and compliance with or adherence to repeated screening, is an important way of trying to raise the overall sensitivity of cervical screening.  It is quite clear that HPV testing will reset the risk, because there will be an increased detection of underlying pre-cancerous lesions, and that will happen.<\/p><p>It is also the case that because women who are HPV negative are at such low risk, not just at that moment of time but in the short term, that screening intervals could increase.

Some people have been involved from the start and some people came in at a later stage.  I thank them for the detailed information provided to us.  I will start with Professor Kitchener.  His report states reviews were carried out of 1,000 women.  It is not easy to do a review.  It is a complex process and involves many people.  Professor Kitchener has given that explanation, but in his report he has stated there were 20,000 data items.  He might outline what those data items are, because I understood that around 3,500 smear results were reviewed.  How is that total of 20,000 data items made up?<\/p> <p>  Professor Kitchener also referred to the comparison with the UK.  The Irish results were similar to the UK.  Regarding audits undertaken in the UK, what has been the experience regarding releasing information back to the patients?  Is that process in place?  I understand that in some European countries information from an audit it not released.  It is retained because the whole idea of an audit is to ensure the system is working, first of all, and then that any glitches are addressed.  Will Professor Kitchener deal with those issues?<\/p> <p>  I turn now to the issue of staffing and the challenges staff have faced over the past 18 months.  I refer in particular to comments made by Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell, who is based in Cork and Kerry, which set out clearly that staff have faced major challenges in some centres.  I understand that in some centres there have been resignations and people have been difficult to replace.  Has any mechanism been put in place to support staff who had to deal with this defensive work daily during the past 18 months?  In fairness, all the staff have been doing their best to provide the best possible service.  The public perception was different, however.  If staff are facing challenges, it is important that they have the necessary support.  The last time I raised this issue was when someone from the Medical Council was in here.  I am referring to a situation where there is an adverse outcome regarding work done within the HSE or by medical staff and the lack of support available.  Have we identified how we can support and retain staff?  <\/p> <p>  Also on staffing, the number of consultants in this area is very small.  The total number of consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology is about 135, and it is smaller again in this particular area.  Have we set out how many people are due to retire in the next five years, how many people are in training and how many people we need to encourage to go into training in this area?  What work is being done on that issue?  I ask that because I see major challenges.  For example, I have heard of two people who have dropped out of the area of obstetrics and gynaecology.  One person was in training for nine years, but then decided to go back to do GP training.  The second person had done six years of training in obstetrics and gynaecology before dropping out, again to do GP training.  It is the same in this particular area.  What supports are we putting in place?  How can we now help retain those staff and ensure we have the necessary numbers of staff in place to deal with requirements and provide an adequate service for the patients?  They are entitled to the best quality service and to do that it is necessary to have the staff.  Those are my opening questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#N00600","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I will deal with one of Senator Colm Burke's questions and refer the other to Dr. Walker.  The Senator asked about the policy of disclosure in England.  That policy was developed some years ago by policy-makers who felt it was important that there was transparency in the system.  That was what it was all about.  It was a measure taken to try to increase public confidence in the cervical screening programme.  Senator Burke is correct that in a number of countries with high standards of cervical screening that the results of slide audits are not disclosed to individual women.  I have recently been in contact with the director of the world-renowned cervical screening programme in British Columbia.  He informed me that the programme has not been doing that, but they are examining the resources put in place in England for that purpose.  The Senator is correct about other countries with good programmes in Europe.  We have this policy of disclosure and we think it is a good policy.<\/p> <p>  As for the response women have to this situation, a significant proportion when asked do not want to know the result of the slide review because they are content that they have been diagnosed.  They may regret and be upset, of course, that cancer intervened, but having been treated they do not necessarily want rake over all of that again.  Other women do want to know and when some find out they are prepared to accept the results in the context of the limitations of screening.  Some women may also wish to use the results as a basis for pursuing litigation.  The policy is there and the interaction women have with that policy of disclosure is a matter of individual preference.  I will hand over to Dr. Walker now, if I may, to answer the question concerning the size of the data.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Henry Kitchener"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I have in my mind now the spread across as we were working on the letters.

Then there is consensus, if there was a consensus, and the subjective comments, if made.

The staff have provided extra sessions and done a huge volume of work to try to bring about some stability.  They are still challenged in the service.  What has been put in place is a working group involving the acute hospitals, the women and infants programme, Dr. McKenna and CervicalCheck, under Dr. Doherty.  There is a team in place to examine a number of issues, one being investment.

I pay tribute to them for their great resilience and for sticking with the programme over the past 18 months.  The unit proved quite successful at holding on to staff in a period of markedly increased demand, not only in terms of the number of inquiries but also in terms of the nature of the interactions with the public.

The past year has seen a remarkable increase in demand, not just through the screening service but also through direct referrals from GPs.

Perhaps it is not Dr. Doherty's area, but my understanding is that before the start of the cervical screening programme ten years ago we had the highest rate of cervical cancer in Europe, and we had done nothing to try to impact on that.  I think Dr. Walker said at the private briefing that it has gone down 7% year on year; that is what I wrote down that day.  It may be 5.5% as Dr. Doherty said, but at least it is in the right direction.  There was a comment passed here yesterday, and I am not sure if I misinterpreted it, asking if there was a material impact.  It is very important that somebody with a medical background, who is qualified to say it, can say categorically here today that we used to have an increasing rate of 4% and now it is between 5.5% and 7% in the downward direction.  The net impact of that is lives saved, but also that early intervention has had positive outcomes for the population for women who might have had their fertility or their personal lives affected.  <\/p> <p>  It is not just about mortality.  One of the witnesses said earlier on that it is about having the least impact on people's lives.  Reference was also made earlier to the consequences of over-diagnosis, or dealing with false positives, and that one does not start zapping everybody with radiation if they have a small cellular change, that that has a net impact on the rest of their cells.  If it was as easy as just assuming everybody had a certain low level we could zap everybody, but that is not the way it is done.

She talked in very clear and passionate terms about her gynaecological practice in the UK, where she had trained, and seeing young women presenting with late-stage cervical cancer, and lives being lost with young children.  She was instrumental in making the case in public and political terms, for investment in the development of a new programme at a time, in 2008, when the overall expenditure on the health system was being reduced.

I know that Senator James Reilly was instrumental in bringing the truth of the situation to the fore as well.  To go back to today's job, I have been meeting all the witnesses at the Committee of Public Accounts and this committee for a while now and for 18 months with regard to this matter.<\/p><p>The words \"blame\" and \"truth\" have come up a lot.  I would level the blame for this on the audit and, in particular, whoever it was who decided that it was a good idea to audit without considering the impact of the audit results.  Something that was imprecise, with a 70% detection rate, was being audited so naturally the results would not be easy to read if someone fell into the other 30% all the time and had cancer.  The main lesson that needs to be learned is that in the context of everything that is done by the Department and the HSE, the patient must be to the fore.  The impact all the way down to the person whose slide is involved must be considered.<\/p><p> Another lesson from what happened involves the lack of leadership and governance.  It was very clear to me and to other members of the committees that no one seemed to be in charge.  There was a vacuum and this left space for falsehoods or for incomplete information to get out.  A lie is halfway around the world before the truth is putting its boots on.  That is really what happened in this case to some extent.  I am grateful for the report and I believe in its independence.  However, it is very difficult to explain to people that despite the questionable quality assurance that was in play when we were going over to see the labs, despite not noticing that slides were being sent to other labs in clear breach of contract, despite the guy in Salford operating without approval and despite all the things we discovered, it appears that our gross population data, as per the report, is not too different from that of the UK.  I believe that but it is very difficult to communicate it to the public and to say that, despite all that has happened over the past 18 months, \"Nothing to worry about girls, it has all been fine.\"  That is a very hard message to get across to people and they do question it.<\/p><p> In terms of the labelling of slides, I can understand the complexities involved.  I would like to clarify something which emerged yesterday and about which I am unhappy.  Where there was a slide that was concordant with the result, it was categorised as concordant.  Where a slide was discordant with the CervicalCheck result, it was discordant.  Dr. Walker spoke about the non-homogenous group, namely, the third group of people.  I agree with him, particularly in the context of trying to just force everybody into that group.  On the basis of what he stated, they were not a homogenous group and they could have had no smears.  I just want to clarify that where there was an assumption or a decision made that a slide was concordant, there was actually a physical slide present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#P02300","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Absolutely, 100%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Walker"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>There was no default position of concordance.

In terms of looking at people's smears, there was no indication given to slide readers or operatives of who the slides belonged to.  Is that not true?  The process was totally anonymous.  The slide readers knew that the person had cancer, because that was obviously the trigger, but they did not know it was my smear, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's smear or whatever.

This has been a testing time for many of us on the committee.  Our job is to interrogate what went wrong.  I know it has been difficult for many of the witnesses and many staff working in the system.  I ask them, however, to understand where we are coming from.  It is very difficult to explain to the public that the test being provided to women was only 70% accurate.  Some women do not think about having a smear test but most do not look forward to it.  It is something they do because they have bought into the system.  It was very difficult to meet women or families who had lost people.  In the information vacuum we had in the immediate aftermath of this crisis, the medical people at the top of the Department - I have the height of respect for Dr. Holohan and Dr. McKenna - should have taken hold of the reins.  There are lessons for all of us in this.  I am not saying I am blameless either but there should have been better leadership at the top, especially when so much was at stake.  We had the roll-out of a large population-based screening programme involving an invasive test for a cancer that is personal to people and has affected many families.  It was such a basket case of a situation 18 months ago.  I genuinely believe the position has improved, although we could not possibly have gone any further backwards, and we will learn from this experience.<\/p> <p>  Stephen Teap spoke at our meeting yesterday about the lack of organisation and leadership.  The medical person, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, who has arguably saved more lives than anyone in this room, was the first person to get the chop.  Lessons have to be applied from what we have learned today.  If I have the privilege of being a Member of these Houses in the next term, I will be disappointed if we ever again come across such a lack of organisation or top-down accountability in the HSE or the Department.  It is regrettable for population health that we have ended up where we are today.  It is testament to the work of all the witnesses, the laboratories and the patient advocates that we can, as a result of the report from RCOG, say that despite all that has happened, the screening programme has not been pointless or a waste of time and money because women have lived who would ordinarily have died and women have had better outcomes than they would have had if there had not been a screening programme.

That is probably true.  All I will say, and this is a personal reflection, is that it was a difficult time for everybody.  That is not any form of excuse.  In the public engagements in the early days of this, there was a concerted effort to do exactly what Deputy O'Connell is reasonably suggesting, namely, to establish and provide clear communications.  Good work was done in that regard between the colleges, the HSE and others.  It got to a point where communicating in public and doing our jobs in public in the normal way became almost impossible.  I am not reflecting on that in terms of us doing our jobs alone, but it impeded our ability to be able to provide the assurance to people who were using the services.  That is where the regret is.  However, we are a long way down the road, as the Deputy has said, in learning the lessons that come from this.

I will park that.  Deputy O'Connell also referred to her colleague, Senator Reilly, who advocated for the introduction of a national screening programme.  At the time, he stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI understand several laboratories are now accredited, including Beaumont\/Rotunda, RCSI, St. James's Hospital through its connection with Antrim and Altnagelvin Hospital, which has looked after the needs of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. St. Luke's is also mid-way through the process. <\/blockquote> <p>Having pointed out all that, he said: &quot;This call for action obviously fell on deaf ears&quot;.  He continues to say that instead of addressing this issue and ensuring that our laboratories would be in a position to tender for and successfully provide cytology, there was a rushed and ill-considered decision that has serious consequences for our health service and for the health of our women and further begs the question as to why we sought out partners in the USA.  At the time, the unions, professionals, academics and many politicians advocated against the outsourcing of our health service to the USA.  Why do all the bodies here think this is not an issue, when they have settlements for several millions in several high-profile cases from laboratories in the USA?  Are the bodies here happy with the way those laboratories were run when we knew they were not ISO-accredited, they were processing 100 slides per day compared with an average of 30 to 60 in Irish laboratories, that the standards were lower and all the evidence from Dr. Scally?  Why is there not something to look at?  The NHS has a document in which it advises on the guidance of applying duty of candour and disclosure for audit results.  It states &quot;sometimes it can be hard for screening services to know how to distinguish between a false negative\/false positive that has occurred because of the limitations of screening and a false negative\/false positive that has occurred because <i>something has gone wrong<\/i>&quot;.  I note &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; is written in italics.  Something went wrong in the cases of the women with whom the laboratories settled for millions.  More cases are coming up.  Cases have fallen outside the audit and outside the RCOG report that are now coming to light too.  That will go to court and cannot go through this non-adversarial process.  Nobody has actually looked at what went wrong.  This is a problem and it is very disappointing that RCOG was not able to look at it either.  Something has to have gone wrong when one hears evidence that states that Dr. Scally told us that he could not look at the particulars in Lorraine Walsh's case because the laboratory told him it did not have the records.<\/p><p>An answer to a parliamentary question about the missing slides stated that more than 1,700 slides were transferred for the RCOG report.  The HSE reported that during the process, a total of 35 slides of women or their next of kin who had consented were not located by the laboratories at the closing date for the slides to be transferred on 7 June.  Does that inspire confidence?  I am not trying to undermine the process, the screening or the need for it, but does that inspire confidence in laboratories that tell Dr. Scally that they cannot investigate the particulars of very serious and high-profile cases because the evidence is missing and that somehow cannot find 35 slides that should have been part of the RCOG report?  As it happens, many of those 35 slides had serious misreadings.  My final question to RCOG is, if it had those slides and they had serious misreadings, would that change the outcome of its judgment that what happened here in Ireland is broadly in line with the audit of what happened in Britain?  I do not believe it reflects it.  I think it would change it and the headline here is that we are broadly in line, in our audit, with what happened under the NHS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#S01900","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":410,"content":"<p>As to whether the fact that 35 slides were missing would have made a material difference to our-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#S02000","nonspeaker":"Professor Henry Kitchener"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>If they were included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121800002#S02100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576627200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I do not believe that would have made a material difference.

Each and every one of these cases is of major consequence to the lives of women.

The transparency and accountability of the Oireachtas and the work of this committee, in particular, have been very effective in dealing with this issue.  We insisted on the forensic audit, which turned out to be the KOSI audit.  We have nothing to be ashamed of here as a committee.  We work as a committee.  We are not political in that context.  We want to see a future for football that involves funding being restored for young people and women who play the game.  I understand that the assets of the FAI include club grounds around the country, such as United Park in Drogheda.  We want to ensure that regardless of whatever happens, these assets remain in sport ownership, if at all possible.  I do not know what will happen, but I know that everybody up and down the country wants us to get a new committee in place, to get the new directors in place and to move to the future.  We want to ensure the mothers and fathers who are out with their children every week in good and bad weather have confidence in football as a sport.

I am also joined by two officials: Mr. Ken Spratt, who is an assistant secretary in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Mr. Peter Hogan, who is a principal officer in the sports division of the Department.  I would like to respond to what the Chairman said about my opening statement being provided late by apologising for the fact that it was not possible to share a copy of the statement with the committee earlier than this morning.  I was receiving responses to queries from UEFA, the Attorney General and Sport Ireland yesterday afternoon.  Therefore, this statement was not finalised until last night.  In fact, one or two changes were later this morning after the script was provided to the committee.<\/p><p>It is deeply disappointing to be before this committee once more to discuss the need for major reform of the FAI.  It was on St. Patrick's Day that we first read in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>about a most irregular financial transaction, namely, the 2017 loan of &euro;100,000 by the former chief executive.  This was prompted by a financial crisis in the FAI.  The association was looking at a situation in which it could not settle its creditors.  The national governing body for football in Ireland, which is one of the largest sporting bodies in the State, found itself without funds to pay for its day-to-day operations.  In such circumstances, the board of Sport Ireland had no choice but to suspend funding to the FAI for this breach of funding conditions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I confirmed that no funding from the Department&rsquo;s sports capital programme would be provided until the corporate governance and financial control issues had been resolved to our satisfaction.  I regret that this position remains unchanged today, notwithstanding the good efforts of Sport Ireland, the Institute of Public Administration and the professional firms that have been advising the FAI throughout this process.<\/p><p>The initial story in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>was followed by a distressing drip feed of stories in the national media outlining years of poor corporate governance, poor financial management and a complete lack of proper oversight or key controls.  This culminated in a disastrous appearance of representatives of the FAI before this committee in April.  The former chief executive appeared before the committee but chose not to respond to the important questions tabled by members.  The members of the FAI board who attended that meeting did nothing to restore confidence.  It was clear after the meeting that there was a need for a robust independent review of all financial matters and of the governance structure of the FAI.  Like the members of the committee, I am dismayed that the FAI has decided not to appear here today.  I made it clear some months ago that there was a need for a total clear-out of the FAI board as part of a complete break from the past.  In respect of the appointment of an interim chief executive, I stated explicitly that it was not in the FAI's interests to appoint anyone associated with the old regime.  I was rebuffed in both cases, as was the FAI's right, firstly by the appointment of Mr. Noel Mooney as the interim chief executive and then by the decision of the President of the FAI, Mr. Donal Conway, and Mr. John Earley to stand for re-election to the board in July.  I understand that both of them have finally decided to step down, and that Mr. Earley has already resigned.<\/p><p>The governance review group carried out a serious review of the weaknesses in the FAI's governance which have led directly to this crisis.  The group made many recommendations, all of which were accepted by the FAI.  As the committee will be aware, one of the most important recommendations involved the appointment of an independent chair and three other independent directors.  As we have seen, recommendation is one thing and implementation is apparently completely different.  It is a source of great and ongoing frustration that, five months later, these independent directors have incredibly not yet been appointed.  I have not received a satisfactory explanation of the reason for the non-completion of this process.  This should have been one of the first things the FAI did to start the process of restoring trust in the association.  Instead, as we approach the end of the year, we find ourselves still waiting for these vital appointments.  I have been advised that the appointments will take place in the very near future.  I reiterate that filling the posts of the independent chair and the independent directors must be and is the first priority for the FAI.  Thereafter, it should move without delay to launch a robust and competitive process to recruit a new independent chief executive.<\/p><p>The final report of the KOSI audit was received by Sport Ireland at the end of last month.  I am restricted in what I can say about the KOSI report, which is with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  Transparency is always crucial when it comes to tackling difficulties like those of the FAI.  On foot of requests from this committee for the report in full, or even a redacted version, I have taken legal advice from my Department's legal adviser and the Attorney General.  They have insisted that it would be unlawful for me to furnish the committee with a copy of the report.  I have also consulted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has advised me that the matters outlined in the KOSI report are central to its investigations and those of the ODCE.  The Garda has further advised me that making the report public at this time could have serious implications for any criminal proceedings subsequently brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p><p>While I would very much like to share the KOSI report, and my instinct is to do so, it is clear from the advice I have been given by the Garda that even a heavily redacted copy could undermine its work.  Consequently, I am not in a position to share the report with the committee today.  I hope I will be able to furnish it at some point in the future when the investigations that are under way have been concluded.  I am somewhat relieved to confirm to the committee that the KOSI auditors found that the State funding given to the FAI was expended for the purposes for which it was provided.  This was one of the key questions we wanted the auditors to answer.  The committee was clear in its desire that the audit would be forensic in nature.  I am pleased to assure members that the KOSI audit team pursued a forensic approach in its assessment of the FAI's compliance with the terms and conditions for Sport Ireland grant funding.<\/p><p>The second key question for KOSI was an assessment of whether the association could demonstrate its fitness to handle public funds.  The committee will be aware that after the board of Sport Ireland considered the KOSI audit on 27 November last, it decided against restoring funding to the FAI.<\/p><p>While I have been advised that it would be unlawful to share the full details of the KOSI auditors&rsquo; findings, I can confirm that their opinion is that the FAI is not fit to handle public funds.  They acknowledge that some steps have been taken to address shortcomings, but there is a steep mountain to climb before we can reinstate funding to the FAI.<\/p><p> In the interim, we have been looking at all options to continue our support for those who really matter, namely, the clubs, players and coaches at the heart of Irish grassroots soccer.  We have developed a scheme through Sport Ireland to support the players on the women&rsquo;s national team.  Sport Ireland has engaged BDO Ireland to deliver funding and other support to the players, with the assurance that no public funds will be disbursed directly or indirectly to the FAI.  This arrangement will enable us to continue to support the players as they seek to clinch qualification for the women&rsquo;s EURO 2020, while assuring taxpayers that funding will be safeguarded.  I am pleased to be able to reveal to the committee that Sport Ireland has put together a similar scheme to deliver support for the youth field sports programme which has been the primary vehicle for public funding for the development of soccer.  This funding will ensure continued support for 60 development officers and the programmes they deliver throughout the country.  This scheme will begin next month, and if necessary will deliver funding of &euro;2.3 million to the development officers throughout 2020.  Notwithstanding the suspension of Sport Ireland funding, there has been no break in these programmes and there will be no break.  Mr. Treacy will be able to provide the committee with more detail about this funding scheme.  Not one euro of this funding will go to the FAI.  It will not receive a single cent, directly or indirectly, until we are fully satisfied that all weaknesses in governance and financial control have been fully addressed.  The funding will be channelled through a payroll processing company which will make payments directly to the development officers themselves.  That company will also ensure the payment of deducted taxes, PRSI and expenses as appropriate.  Development officers play a vital role in supporting clubs throughout the country, and the last thing we want to do is disrupt their important work.  Grassroots football must not suffer because of the mistakes of those at the top of the greasy pole.<\/p><p> As members of the committee will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I met with members of the FAI board on Monday evening.  The delegation was led by the vice president and executive lead, Mr. Paul Cooke, along with the FAI's financial advisers from Grant Thornton.  It was a sobering experience.  As I have stated, the FAI delegation accepted the need for a full changeover of the board, and for the urgent appointment of an independent chair, directors, and chief executive without undue delay.  The FAI delegation presented the stark reality of the association&rsquo;s financial crisis and outlined their proposed business plan to overcome these very considerable challenges.  They came seeking a bailout.  Deputy Griffin and I made it clear to the FAI that we cannot and will not provide it with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The KOSI report makes it clear that the association is not in a fit state to receive public funds and we must respect that.  However, we did tell the delegation that we would meet with UEFA to discuss the FAI&rsquo;s challenges.  Officials in my Department are in contact with UEFA with a view to arranging a meeting as early as possible, which we expect to be held in early January. <\/p><p> Before concluding, Deputy Griffin and I pay tribute to the forgotten stakeholders - the FAI staff who are facing an uncertain future.  The staff at the FAI have endured pay freezes and more over the past ten years, and have been shocked to learn about the previously undisclosed pay agreements with the former chief executive.  They are not the ones who caused this problem and they deserve recognition, not victimhood, for their service to Irish football.  Deputy Griffin and I will be meeting with SIPTU and the employees&rsquo; representatives later this evening to hear their concerns.  I assure them that we will continue to engage with them over the challenging days to come.  I will now hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#H00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee today, though it gives me no joy that we are once again discussing the difficult situation of soccer in Ireland.  This should be a time for optimism, given the recent positive performances from our men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s national teams and the exciting prospect of hosting EURO 2020 matches at the Aviva Stadium next year.  However, the FAI has not been able to move on from the crisis which began last March.  I am sorry to say that we are now seeing the real impact of failures in financial management and corporate governance at the top tier of the football pyramid on those at the bottom, namely, the grassroots clubs, coaches, volunteers, players and supporters.  One of the most common criticisms we heard of the FAI is that the decisions were made by a small group at the top and the wider membership never got the opportunity to have their say.  Last May, the Minister and I hosted a very successful Irish football stakeholders forum in the Mansion House, which was also attended by several members of this committee.  That forum brought together stakeholders from across the Irish football community to discuss the future direction of football in Ireland.  There were some hysterical warnings that this would be a bad-tempered event which would not deliver anything meaningful.  However, the engagement by those who attended was respectful, considered, and serious about the well-being of the sport.  There was an openness to new ideas and a willingness to listen to the views of other sectors of the game.  The broader football community made it clear that they are committed to growing their sport and that they want to move past the current crisis.  We in Government are committed to growing football in Ireland as well.  We know the positive role it plays in Irish life in clubs throughout the country.  In spite of the challenges, we have been doing all we can to support the game of soccer in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Government assistance for capital projects, we can be very proud of the huge improvements in sports facilities in recent years.  More than 10,000 projects have benefitted from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing total allocations in that time to more than &euro;1 billion.  Soccer clubs have also benefitted significantly in this regard.  More than &euro;156 million has been granted to soccer clubs, leagues and organisations.  The final grants under the 2018 round of the sports capital programme were announced last month and under this round alone, more than 300 grants valued at &euro;6.5 million were allocated to soccer clubs throughout the country.  The Department is now undertaking a full review of all aspects of the 2018 sports capital programme.  This review will include consideration of the timing and scale of the next round of the programme.  I expect that the programme will be open for applications again in the coming months and I look forward to seeing many more excellent soccer projects from clubs in every county applying and being assisted.<\/p> <p>  This committee had a very interesting discussion with Hockey Ireland last week, which underscored the importance of State support for our amateur athletes representing Ireland in international competitions.  The Minister and I are absolutely committed to supporting the players in the women&rsquo;s national team who make such a huge contribution as the leading exponents of women&rsquo;s football in Ireland.  I am delighted that we have been able to develop an effective intermediary arrangement for the payment of grant funding for the women&rsquo;s national team.  The team achieved record attendance for international home games this year and delivered some impressive performances to boot.  I am confident that under the guidance of team manager Vera Pauw the team can achieve its ambition of qualifying for its first major tournament, the women's EURO 2021.  As the Minister said, Sport Ireland has developed a similar arrangement for the provision of funding for development officers.  I welcome this pragmatic solution and I am confident that with Sport Ireland support, development officers will be able to continue their important work with grassroots soccer.<\/p> <p>  Sport Ireland is continuing to explore every option to continue our support for soccer in Ireland.  With the best will in the world, it may not be possible to find a mechanism for every programme.  This is why it is so important that those at the top of the FAI commit to restoring public trust.  The board must show leadership and act decisively to implement serious reform in the association&rsquo;s corporate governance.<\/p><p>At the meeting earlier this week, the board members acknowledged to the Minister and myself the serious failures that occurred under the previous regime.  They indicated that they accept the urgent need for reform.  I trust that they will redouble their efforts to make good on their commitment to overhaul their association.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, when governance failures occur within individual organisations, they tend to damage the reputation of the entire sports system.  It would be unfair to tar all of those involved in Irish sport with the same brush.  I frequently meet the chairs, directors and chief executives of the various national governing bodies, as do the committee members, and I have great confidence in their commitment to strive always for the benefit of their members and to the values of sport such as honesty, integrity and fair play.  I understand, however, that a crisis such as this one lays bare structural weaknesses which, if not addressed, can lead to difficulties in the future.  The development of stronger governance is therefore very important, at both an organisation and a system level.  The need for measures aimed at better governance in national governing bodies was recognised a number of years ago and in 2017, Sport Ireland introduced the mandatory adoption by NGBs of the governance code for sport, formerly the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity sector.  The governance code for sport is a principles-based code consisting of best practice for boards.<\/p><p> The Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027, which the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I published in 2018, requires that all national governing bodies, NGBs, and local sports partnerships are signed up to the governance code by the end of 2021.  I am pleased to say that there has been good progress with 31 NGBs and sporting bodies already fully signed up to the code, with a further 50 working towards adoption of the code.  The FAI is one of those NGBs which has committed to achieving compliance with the governance code.  I urge the board and the new CEO, when that person is appointed, to ensure that they continue this important work.<\/p><p> As the committee knows, Sport Ireland already has robust auditing arrangements in place in respect of the funding it allocates to the main field sport NGBs &ndash; the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU.  Following discussions at this committee earlier this year, Sport Ireland has now strengthened the terms and conditions of its funding schemes, which will apply to grants from 2020.  The changes confer full audit rights on Sport Ireland and require NGBs to disclose the remuneration packages of their CEOs to Sport Ireland.  I acknowledge the good work that Sport Ireland has done in revising the terms of conditions of funding.<\/p><p> The most immediate tasks for the FAI are to appoint the independent chair, the other independent directors and an independent, full-time chief executive.  These appointments are vital for the association to rebuild public trust and to enable the Government to once again provide funding for the FAI&rsquo;s programmes and capital projects.  The FAI board members confirmed to the Minister and myself that they are absolutely committed to these appointments.  I hope that we will see progress in the near future.  I welcome the announcement by Donal Conway that he will step down at an extraordinary general meeting, EGM, in January and the recent resignation of John Earley from the board.  I regret that they did not step down at the EGM last summer but I welcome the fact that they are now stepping down to make way for new leadership in the FAI.<\/p><p> As members will know, the FAI, at its annual general meeting, AGM, in June, agreed overwhelmingly to accept the recommendations of the governance review group and to completely overhaul the association&rsquo;s rule book and structures.  This was a positive step and I know that progress has been made since then.  That progress must be maintained if the FAI is to restore public trust.<\/p><p> I reiterate that no public funding will be provided to the FAI by my Department or Sport Ireland until we see evidence of real reform and a clean break with the previous regime at board and executive levels.  The FAI is well aware of the steps it needs to take to bring about a situation where public funding can be reinstated.  I urge it to do so without any further delays.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#J00200","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I ask John Treacy to give his address.

At each meeting, we detailed in-depth the remit of Sport Ireland, its funding relationship with the FAI and actions taken to support the FAI through its ongoing situation.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, KOSI Corporation Limited recently completed its forensic audit of the FAI, which was commissioned by Sport Ireland under the terms and conditions of grant approval.  The committee will be aware that the audit report was referred by the board of Sport Ireland to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Today, I will outline to the committee that the independent forensic KOSI audit verified that taxpayer funding to the FAI, through Sport Ireland, was spent in line with the approved submissions and for the purposes it was given by Sport Ireland during the period 2015-2018<i>.  <\/i>I will give an overview of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s role and remit under the Sport Ireland Act 2015, with a particular focus on the extent of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s powers with regard to the oversight of public funding invested in our national sporting organisations.  I will also inform the committee of recent developments with regard to governance training in national governing bodies of Sport and the revision of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval to enhance, on a consent basis, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s right to conduct audits beyond the scope of funding provided to sporting organisations.<br\/><br\/>KOSI&rsquo;s independent forensic audit of the FAI, which was commissioned by Sport Ireland under the terms and conditions of grant approval agreed with the FAI, has been completed.  Sport Ireland received KOSI&rsquo;s audit report on the FAI on the evening of Tuesday, 26 November, and provided a copy of the report to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in compliance with his request and powers under the Sport Ireland Act 2015.  The KOSI report was considered by the audit and risk committee and the board of Sport Ireland early on Wednesday, 27 November. The independent forensic audit completed by KOSI confirmed that the FAI spent all taxpayer funding allocated through Sport Ireland in line with approved submissions and for the purposes it was given by Sport Ireland during the period 2015 to 2018.  KOSI found that the consumption of Sport Ireland grants had been safely covered by FAI expenditure in the programme areas supported.  It is worth noting that KOSI&rsquo;s overall conclusion was similar to previous internal audits of the FAI completed on Sport Ireland&rsquo;s behalf in 2010, 2014 and 2016, which also found that Sport Ireland funding to the FAI was fully accounted for and expended for the purposes in which it was intended.  The board of Sport Ireland subsequently referred the audit report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, following consideration of legal advice, which included senior counsel input.  As such, for legal reasons, Sport Ireland is not in a position to publish the audit report or provide any further information on it at this time.  Our legal advice is that Sport Ireland cannot discuss the report or its contents in public, including with the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.<br\/><br\/>Following consideration of the KOSI report, the board of Sport Ireland agreed that the suspension and withholding of funding to the FAI remains in place.  However, the board approved the establishment of a process, with the consent of the FAI, to meet with the FAI on an ongoing basis to discuss governance and financial issues and to support the FAI on its reform agenda.  This is an essential requirement to fulfil as part of the pathway towards restoration of Sport Ireland funding to the FAI.  Sport Ireland has written to the FAI in this regard.  The status of funding to the FAI continues to be reviewed by the board of Sport Ireland on an ongoing basis.  The committee will be aware that in November, the board of Sport Ireland approved a payment of 2019 grant funding for the women's senior national football team programme.<\/p><p>The grant of &euro;195,000 will be paid by Sport Ireland to accountancy firm BDO, which will oversee the disbursement of the funding in line with terms and conditions.<\/p><p> The Sport Ireland Act 2015 confers considerable authority in Sport Ireland as the statutory body for the development of sport in Ireland.  The functions of Sport Ireland are prescribed in section 8 of the Sport Ireland Act and include powers to develop participation in sport and high performance sport, eliminate doping in sport as the national anti-doping agency, develop coaching, develop guidelines on the protection of children in sport, and the development of the Sport Ireland campus.  Sport Ireland must adhere to the Sport Ireland Act 2015 and cannot act beyond its legal powers or authority as prescribed by the Act.  As a statutory development agency, Sport Ireland seeks to develop strong sports organisations and recognises the considerable public interest in a successful Irish sports sector.  Sport Ireland is responsible for the investment of public money in sport and the subsequent oversight and accountability of this investment.<\/p><p> From previous meetings, the committee is aware that Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body and Sport Ireland has no regulatory, investigatory or enforcement powers relating to corporate governance in sporting organisations.  This was discussed at length with this committee during meetings earlier this year.  The committee is also aware that there is no provision in the Sport Ireland Act that gives Sport Ireland statutory authority to audit or inspect the books and records of a body in receipt of Sport Ireland funding.  This has been confirmed by our legal advisers.  The committee is aware that funded organisations sign up to Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval, which permits audit on a consent basis.<\/p><p> It is important to note that Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval clearly stipulate that all funded bodies must have in place a valid tax clearance certificate before any funding is paid.  Sport Ireland can confirm it received all necessary tax clearance documentation from the FAI each year, including in 2019.  Furthermore, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval require all sporting bodies to submit to Sport Ireland a copy of its annual financial statements, fully audited by a registered auditor in accordance with Irish generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, accounting standards.  Sport Ireland places fundamental reliance on the statutory auditor's signed audit opinion.<\/p><p> The terms and conditions explicitly state that the accounts furnished to Sport Ireland must \"include all financial transactions of the organisation during the course of the accounting year in question\".  It is important to remind the committee that primary responsibility for preparation of any company's financial statements rests with that company&rsquo;s management and board of directors.  The FAI board is responsible for risk management within the association and for ensuring that the FAI keeps adequate accounting records.  Corporate governance practice and company law require that the directors of a company must not approve accounts unless they are satisfied they give a \"true and fair view\" of the financial position.  Sport Ireland relies on the objective, independent and professional judgment of the statutory auditors whose work was carried out in accordance with international standards on auditing.  Each year the FAI's financial statements were given a clean, unqualified opinion by the external auditor Deloitte.  The audit opinion stated that the auditors had not identified any material misstatements and that the financial statements, in the auditor's opinion, gave a \"true and fair view\" of the financial position of the FAI.<\/p><p> It is clear from the filing of the H4 notice in April and the restated and revised FAI financial statements that this was not the case.  Undeclared transactions of serious concern and unrecorded liabilities for a number of years only came to full public attention on the recent publication of the FAI's 2018 financial statements approximately 12 days ago.  Oversight of compliance with company law is a matter for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  Sport Ireland notes that the ODCE has extensive investigative and enforcement powers and we are aware that its investigation of the FAI, which we understand is serious, is ongoing.<\/p><p> Sport Ireland places a high premium on good governance and encourages high standards in governance from all funded bodies.  As a development agency, it is our aim to provide leadership in this area, empowering sport organisations to take responsibility for their own governance and meet the challenges they face.  We have previously outlined to the committee the range of governance training, seminars and supports provided by Sport Ireland for those in key leadership and governance roles in sporting organisations.  Although Sport Ireland promotes good governance in sporting organisations, we cannot enforce good governance, and it is up to governing bodies themselves to do that.  In accordance with a key corporate governance principle, the board of any national governing body is collectively responsible for leading and directing the organisation&rsquo;s activities and for ensuring that effective systems of internal control are in place.<\/p><p> The committee is aware from Sport Ireland's attendance here in July this year that the board of Sport Ireland has approved revised terms and conditions of grant approval for all Sport Ireland-funded organisations to come into effect for 2020.  To recap for the committee members, the amendments to the terms and conditions include strengthening the audit clause to explicitly confer full audit, inspection and investigative rights on Sport Ireland for every funded body, and the right to audit, inspection or investigation may also extend to any matter of concern to Sport Ireland that arises in respect of the organisation and not just relating to the use made by the organisation of the Sport Ireland grant funding.  The amendments also include making it an explicit condition of funding that Sport Ireland-appointed auditors are entitled to request and receive all the information and explanations they require for the proper performance of their job and making it a condition of funding for all national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships to provide details of the full remuneration packages for their chief executives or equivalent positions to Sport Ireland.  Additionally, Sport Ireland will need to be provided with independent verification that each organisation is fully compliant with the code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland by the end of 2021.  Failure to co-operate fully with any audit, inspection or investigation on a timely basis will entitle Sport Ireland to suspend or withhold grant funding or claim repayment of any grants previously advanced by Sport Ireland.  The board of Sport Ireland is satisfied that these measures are appropriate and necessary in light of the recent learnings from the FAI case.  We are confident that the additions will further strengthen Sport Ireland&rsquo;s authority in respect of overseeing public funds.<\/p><p> The Government&rsquo;s national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships adopt the governance code by the end of 2021.  As reported at the meeting in July, Sport Ireland has taken over the governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations as a governance code for sport.  This follows the decision of the governance code working group to retire the code.  To date, 31 Sport Ireland-funded bodies have fully adopted the code and another 50 are on the adoption journey.<\/p><p> Following recent developments at the FAI, Sport Ireland considered new ways to build and sustain governance capacity and capability within the national governing bodies and local sports partnerships.  Sport Ireland invited applications from senior executives and board members within national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships to undertake a level 9 professional certificate in governance.  This certificate is delivered by the Institute of Public Administration and accredited by the National University of Ireland.  There were 60 applications received from national governing bodies and local sports partnerships and, following a shortlisting process, 51 applicants were selected for participation in the programme from a total of 35 sporting bodies. It is a one-year part-time programme that addresses a key area of concern to executives, boards and committees across the sport sector.<\/p><p> This accredited programme examines governance as a set of structures, arrangements, processes and procedures.  It focuses on the principles and culture that ensure organisations are properly directed and controlled.  The course covers the roles and responsibilities of governing bodies and boards, the performance and accountability of directors and executives, assurance arrangements, fiduciary responsibilities, distinction of executive and non-executive functions and reserved functions of boards, strategy, finance and leadership.  On completion of the course, graduates will have authoritative knowledge of the principles and practices associated with proper direction, decision-making and control in organisations.  The programme commenced on 15 November this year.<\/p><p>The committee will recall from previous meetings that the FAI established an implementation oversight group tasked with overseeing implementation of the 78 recommendation of the governance review group report conducted by the IPA.  The effective ongoing operation of the implementation oversight group as set out in the governance review group&rsquo;s report is of vital importance on the journey to reforming FAI governance, and restoring public trust and confidence in the FAI.  The association recently provided an update on the work of the implementation oversight group.  It reported that 40% of the recommendations have been implemented, including 11 priority actions.  <\/p><p> I will summarise the information given in this statement.  The KOSI audit independently confirms that the FAI spent all Sport Ireland funding in line with approved submissions and for the purposes it was given by Sport Ireland during the period 2015 to 2018.  Sport Ireland is the statutory development agency for sport.  Under the Sport Ireland Act 2015, Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body, and it has no regulatory, investigatory or enforcement powers in respect of corporate governance in sporting bodies.  No provision of the Act that gives Sport Ireland statutory authority to audit or inspect the books and records of a body in receipt of its funding.  This has been confirmed by our legal advisers.   The board of Sport Ireland has approved revised terms and conditions of grant approval for all Sport Ireland-funded organisations to come into effect for 2020 funding.  This includes the strengthening of the audit clause to explicitly confer full audit, inspection and investigative rights on Sport Ireland for every funded body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Treacy.

I take from his presentation that the implementation of reform in the FAI is painstakingly slow.  I get the impression it is being brought kicking and screaming to implement reform.

I do not believe this is a good reason for not making the appointment of a new chief executive or starting the process or retaining the current chairman.  The key to change and the FAI coming into a new corporate governance regime and the FAI's credibility is that those independent directors must be appointed.  It is now six months later and they have not been.  The reasons given vary but the delay is unacceptable.  We believe the independent directors are the key to unlocking progress and reform, which is not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#M00600","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The Minister has outlined how the funding is to be restored to grassroots soccer.

A previous speaker referred to the independent directors.  We all do our own research and we try to pick up information from the press corps, people we know in the FAI, Department officials and so on.  There seems to be total confusion with regard to the independent directors.  There are people in the FAI who claim not to know the names of the independent directors and that they were shown only profiles of independent directors rather than names.  They say they are screaming for the independent directors to be appointed and are not delaying these appointments.  I am told that the independent directors have been selected and are engaging with Grant Thornton and getting financial briefings before taking up their positions.

The other aspect is that, obviously, we can do something but we cannot do something for everyone.  We have managed to do something for the women's team and we have managed to do something for the development officers.  I come at it from a different perspective, as a League of Ireland fan.  If the FAI goes into examinership in the morning, or in April, May or June, it is my understanding that the league ceases - it is gone, and there is no League of Ireland.  The clubs will remain but they will not have a league to play in and there will not be any European qualification places available because they are given to the governing body and not directly to the clubs.<\/p> <p>  Have we done any work on possible scenarios?  In the eventuality that the FAI had to go into examinership, is it possible to continue the league?  If it does not go into examinership and just goes under, does the league automatically collapse?  What happens to those qualification places?  What happens to any money that may be outstanding to League of Ireland clubs?  If it does go into examinership, are penalties imposed on the FAI in terms of qualification places for European competitions which will be passed on to League of Ireland clubs?

Those sports, just by virtue of their size, get a proportionately larger amount of the overall sports capital budget.  Of the &euro;57 million allocation under the most recent round, they received &euro;6.5 million.  That is considerable, amounting to roughly &euro;1 out of every &euro;8 that was administered.  The capital grants do reflect the size of the sports more than the current allocation, the reason being that there is strong income for those sports on the current side which other national bodies do not have.  In 2017, the capital allocation of &euro;7 million to the sports in question again represented approximately one eighth of the funding that was given nationally through the sports capital programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#S02000","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":767,"content":"<p>However, all of those sports have other sources of funding as well.

He will recall that I sent him a letter concerning this meeting.  I will be brief as colleagues have asked a lot of good questions.  Having audited its accounts, Deloitte announced that the FAI is effectively bust.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Before indicating its intention to resign as auditor, Deloitte restated the 2017 accounts from approximately &euro;2.7 million of a profit to a loss of &euro;2.7 million, which is a shift of about &euro;5.5 million.  I have some sympathy and understanding for Sport Ireland and the challenges it faces because, it seems, it bases its review, to a large degree, on independent audited accounts.  Having said that, I have the Sport Ireland Act 2015, to which several speakers referred, in front of me, and I take issue with one or two of the points Mr. Treacy made in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Section 11 of the Act, which sets out the criteria, terms and conditions of assistance, states, in subsection (3)(a), that Sport Ireland may \"request any person or body applying for or receiving assistance under section 8(4)(a) to supply Sport Ireland with information in such form and at such time as it may require\".  This means that Sport Ireland has absolute flexibility in terms of how deep it wants to dive.  I have the transcript of the meeting where I asked whether Sport Ireland had identified any red flags in this regard, in response to which Mr. Treacy did not highlight any concerns.  To me, a red flag was raised when Deputy Jonathan O'Brien or Deputy MacSharry - I am not sure which of them it was - asked whether there had been a meeting with the board of the FAI.  The answer given was that there was one such meeting in 2015 and there were two further occasions on which members of the board were invited in by Sport Ireland but did not show up.  Did they give a reason for not showing up?  Subsequent to their not showing up, Sport Ireland still gave the FAI &euro;2.9 million in funding in January or February of this year.

What happened in the past should never have happened.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, the Garda and others are looking into that and a process is being gone through.  I am asking that we all now consider looking at a transition now, while asking how we can go to the future but learning from the past.  On a transition, I am asking that the Minister, Sport Ireland and the Department consider suggesting to the FAI that a transition process and an interim board be put in place. The problem with new directors coming in is that when they come in to this role, he or she could be personally responsible for the debts in this the past.  Who, in fairness, will do that?  If I was advising somebody, I would suggest that they be very careful in this regard because their house could be on the line.  A new structure should be created for transition in order that good people are placed on the board.  They can then appoint an independent CEO and get professional advice from one of the professional organisations to understand how to restructure in a professional manner.  This is what is needed because there appears to be no transition, plan or structure and we are going headless into this.  A suggestion like this has a good chance of working.  I believe there is a great future for the FAI and out of this dust, a very good soccer structure will emerge in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#U02400","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I will address Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's point by saying that if the independent board members are appointed, they could consider a structure along the lines he has suggested.

Given what has happened over the past two years, it needs to reflect on a name change.  We need to start from scratch.<\/p> <p>  At our first meeting on this matter approximately six months ago, I stated that the FAI was like \"Goodfellas\".  Look at UEFA.  It is the governing body and Mr. John Delaney had a powerful executive role there.  UEFA has questions to answer as well.  What is it doing and what has it done?  Can the committee ask representatives of UEFA to attend a meeting?  The Minister, the Minister of State, their officials and Sport Ireland have done excellent work trying to uncover facts and be helpful, but the FAI's governing body is UEFA and it should come clean about what is happening.

Will he commit that whatever happens, the League of Ireland will be protected?<\/p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions on Limerick FC.  I mentioned them briefly to the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, earlier.  Is the Minister aware that the Limerick FC club is being wound up?  Was he aware of the difficulties facing Limerick FC prior to last week's announcement?  Had he any discussions on the problems at Limerick FC?  As sports Minister, does he have any intention of stepping in to try to save the club, which has existed since 1937?  As things stand, next season's Airtricity League first division will have nine clubs if Limerick FC is not there.  The clubs left will face weeks with no games to play because Limerick FC will not be there.  It is an historical team and people are employed there.  I want to ensure the current position of Limerick FC is not lost in the absolute shambles of the FAI we are discussing today.

I have deep concerns about it.  It is principally a matter for the FAI as to what happens to it in a doomsday situation.  We are trying to avoid that.  That is our ambition.  I am particularly concerned about the League of Ireland and I say this absolutely sincerely because I have felt for some time, as the Deputy does, that it had been neglected to an extent under the old regime.  There is room for improvement and I have made this perfectly clear.  When the independent directors come in, I intend to let them know that one of the great concerns we have relates to the League of Ireland.  It is one of the forgotten stakeholders and it should be given greater consideration and respect for what it is doing.  I will raise the issue of the League of Ireland specifically - I thank Deputies Quinlivan and O'Brien raising it - with UEFA on 14 January.  I am not sure whether UEFA is aware of the vulnerability of the League of Ireland.  I will certainly do this because the league needs protection.  Obviously, it is subject to the consequences of what has happened.  Our ambition is very definitely to save football and to save the League of Ireland and see that it continues to flourish.  I do not want to make any commitments, financial or otherwise, and I am not going to do so.  I would not do that.

There is a long and proud tradition of soccer in Limerick.  There was so much hope in recent years and the club had been performing well until relatively recently, which compounds it.  It is a huge pity.  The licence is a matter for the FAI in terms of league participation.  I acknowledge the fact that an uneven number in the first division present all sorts of difficulties in terms of the team that will have a by every week and the lack of gate takings for those clubs.  Logistically, nine is a very small number to have in a league.  Since the club has gone into receivership, a prospective buyer will be dealing with the banks.  The Department would certainly be open to talking to any prospective buyer on how we could help and how other partners might help, for example, Limerick City and County Council.  I know for a while the club had been playing in Thomond Park.  There was a partnership with Munster Rugby.  At the same time, we cannot really intervene in the day-to-day running of the club or operational matters for the FAI in the context of the league.  The state of the overall league and its future security will be on the agenda for discussion with UEFA.

We will reduce the risk of that immediately through independent directors coming in and that will mean more confidence in the FAI from the stakeholders including UEFA, the banks, the FAI itself and ourselves.  We might be considering changing the name of the organisation but whatever it will be called, we are looking for the moment that door is unlocked.  We might have a real opportunity to do the sorts of things the Deputy is talking about, specifically with the League of Ireland.  This could be a chance for something radical and some real reform could come out of this.  We are staring into a chasm but there are opportunities to correct something that has been going wrong for many years and respond to the things the Deputy is talking about, particularly with regard to the League of Ireland.  We will have an entirely new group of people involved who are not captured by the prejudices and loyalties of the past.  I hope we will have an opportunity in the coming days and weeks to get a strong chief executive in place because that is vital.  We need a strong group of independents who will turn their backs on the past.  We need a strong new chairman and we can set the example from the top.  That is not the solution but it is part thereof, as everyone here recognises.<\/p><p>The principal problem has been diabolical corporate governance and if we can sort that out, we will soon sort out the confidence issue.  We will be able to move on to the details thereafter, some of which are not our business, although the Deputy has addressed them, and many of which are symptoms of the things that are going wrong.  Our ambition and determination is to get those particular parts in place shortly and we can then address the issues about which Deputy is talking.  <\/p><p>There are sensitivities about us getting too involved which we will not breach.  Government policy and confidence are important factors.  We will have confidence if we see steps to reform that are radical enough to satisfy the requirements of corporate governance and begin to set in train an improvement in the finances.<\/p><p>I agree with everything the Deputy said.  We are meeting SIPTU this evening as a matter of urgency in order to hear more of the sorts of things the Deputy is saying because they are important to us.  We recognise the suffering that has been inflicted on people but we also recognise their importance as stakeholders and the contributions they will make to the FAI, or whatever the organisation might be called, in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#CC00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":972,"content":"<p>What about the administrative staff that are needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#CC00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I am aware that Senator Mark Daly has not got in yet.

In the interests of openness and transparency, the business plan that the FAI presented to the Minister on Monday should be provided and made available to the public.  Is the business plan credible?  If we are going to start a culture of openness and transparency, we should start with the business plan and it should have been circulated to the members of the committee. The FAI seems to be good at avoiding meeting Sports Ireland, the Minister and this committee.  The FAI has previously supplied documents that we have seen and which are not credible.  I ask the Minister to provide to the public by this evening the business plan that was proposed.  The Government is being asked to bail out the FAI and we need to know whether there is any credibility to its business plan.<\/p> <p>  I also raise the competency of Deloitte as an auditor although I know it can only deal with the figures it is given.  There must have been interest payments on the loan.  Did Deloitte ever question the figures that were presented?  I ask the Minister and Sport Ireland how many other sporting organisations are Deloitte the auditor for.  How many tickets did Deloitte get from the FAI when it was the auditor of the association?  That would be insightful.  Deloitte did not do its job.<\/p> <p>  Has the Minister made any efforts to find out from the FAI whether the county organisations are being run on the same basis as the FAI?  The culture that exists at the top could seep into every county.  We are talking about reforms and legislation, as we were the last time the Minister was before the committee, and that things have to change.  During the term of this Government, there has been the Olympic Council of Ireland scandal and boxing has been an issue because the people in control at the top of those organisations have got money from the Government but the Government is unable to do what is in the best interests of the sports because the guys at the top are controlling everything.  Power needs to be taken back by the Department and Government because fiefdoms have been created by people in different sporting organisations which are not being run in the best interests of those organisations but of the very few at the top.  There have been issues about the greyhound industry and there are issues now with the FAI.  What legislation has been brought in during his term to stop those sorts of things happening since we found out about the Olympic Council of Ireland?<\/p><p>Given the number of sporting organisations involved and the amount of time being wasted, is there a proposal that an audit will be done - I suggest by a company other than Deloitte - of those organisations?  Instead of us having to bail out the FAI at Christmas in order to keep people who are in jeopardy of losing their jobs because of the incompetence of the bosses in their jobs, we must ensure that we will not be back here again in six months or a couple of years' time discussing another sporting organisation that is being run by individuals for their own gain and profit.  Is the Government proposing that there will be a forensic review?  That is the only way it will work because the auditors seem to be beyond useless.  They are off bolting doors after the horse, or the greyhound in some cases, has gone down the field.  What does the Government intend to do and what legislation has been introduced since we started dealing with the issues relating to the Olympic Council of Ireland?<\/p><p> I want to raise another issue regarding what was brought up here about pension entitlements-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#CC01300","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":984,"content":"<p>Did we receive correspondence on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#DD00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121800002#DD00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1576627200,"counter":986,"content":"<p>Sport Ireland sent us correspondence on that.

Almost every year there is a scandal about a sporting organisation.  The Sports Council does not have all the powers.  It cannot go into an organisation and start opening filing cabinets.  We discussed previously the question of having such powers.  Changing personnel is a way of saying that we will ensure the ship is run better by getting a better captain.  The problem is that the super structure is always wrong.  It seems to be that if there is a bad egg in a sporting organisation, they can do whatever they want.  They run the show.  They hire and they fire, and there is no accountability.  We have seen that time and again.  To come back to the question, does the Minister have the answer?  He might supply it to the committee.  Someone might ask Deloitte if it got tickets from the FAI, the number involved and whether it paid for them.  What we are trying to establish here is the credibility of the organisation.  First and foremost, these are the people who should have raised red flags.  We had this previously with the banking crisis.

If there is not, the nation also wants to know that the clear-out is not complete, that X and Y still have to go and that the Government is still not content.

There appear to be different models of draw-down and different models regarding who is paying back the money or where the money comes from.

A development went ahead on the basis of that set-up.<\/p> <p>  These are matters we are trying to get on top of in order to find out exactly what has been promised and what the implications will be if clubs have factored projected income they had been promised in the future into their business plans and if that income is not available now.

We will see what we can do to help them because the last thing we want is clubs and volunteers who have been audacious enough to put facilities in place for their communities to then find themselves in difficult financial situations as a result of what, effectively, would be a broken promise.

Perhaps through here might be the way.<\/p> <p>  The question on the crisis management is that while I have every confidence both in the Minister and in Sport Ireland, in reference to Deputy Catherine Murphy's point, if there are any additional skills and expertise needed, these should be made available and the Minister should find a way to get these to them.<\/p> <p>  The other point is one I made earlier.  I acknowledge the wish of the Minister to meet UEFA before Christmas.  The fact that the meeting will not take place until 14 January concerns me.  That is not a criticism.  It seems the quicker that meeting can take place, the better.  The downside of all of this is coming at us like an express train.  Any time that is lost in getting a solution worries me.  UEFA needs to be at the table.  It needs to be there now.  I agree with the Minister of State that it should meet him before Christmas.  This will not get better.  It will get worse.
