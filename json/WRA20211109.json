Since 2019, all funds seeking to undertake atypical strategies, must make a pre-submission to the Central Bank and receive pre-clearance.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing supervision, the Central Bank is rigorous in its assessment of risks having regard to the evolving market and risk landscape. Ensuring that funds can clearly demonstrate their compliance with their legislative and regulatory obligations is integral to this process. <\/p>  <p>  Another important development are the steps that we are taking to ensure the introduction of a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), which places obligations on firms and senior individuals within them to set out clearly where responsibility and decision-making lies.

Such developments will lead to the further development of a resilient and trustworthy sector, in which firms and individuals adhere to a culture of fairness and high standards.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to taxation, the European Securities Markets Authority (&ldquo;ESMA&rdquo;), launched a formal inquiry concerning dividend withholding tax reclaim schemes in July 2019.  The Central Bank of Ireland, in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, contributed to this process. ESMA&rsquo;s main conclusion was that Withholding Tax (WHT) schemes are to be primarily considered as a tax related issue and that a legislative and supervisory response should be sought within the boundaries of the tax legislative and supervisory framework. The key recommendation in the report, within the remit of financial services legislation, is that EU National Competent Authorities (NCAs) for securities markets should be empowered - through amendments to EU legislation - to share information received from other NCAs  with national tax authorities, to assist in the detection and prosecution of illegal withholding tax reclaim schemes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[54403\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will ensure that those who avail of the new digital gaming relief are subject to ensuring quality employment and training; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>As I announced during my Budget speech, I am introducing a new tax credit for the digital gaming sector.

These developments highlight the potential of the sector to fulfil a role in relation to community banking.  <\/p><p><b>Review of Lending and Investment Regulations<\/b><\/p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years completed reviews of both the lending and investment frameworks. Following introduction of the new lending regulations on 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to approximately &euro;1.1 billion in additional SME and mortgage loans, with further lending capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has informed me that two credit unions have been approved to avail of the 15% combined lending limit for house and business loans.<\/p><p>As at June 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;372 million, an increase of 18% year-on-year.<\/p><p>The revised investment regulations took effect on 1 March 2018. Under these regulations, credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).<\/p><p>I am pleased to share with the Deputy that two credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). This will provide an additional funding channel for AHBs who have a large role to play in the recently announced Housing for All Action Plan.<\/p><p><b>SME Lending <\/b><\/p><p>Nineteen credit unions, supported by ILCU, CUDA and Metamo, were approved in early 2021 by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme.  Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book.  <\/p><p>SME lending has grown 5.6% year on year to end June 2021.<\/p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit <\/b><\/p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in Budget 2021. My officials have been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communication, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to support increased credit union participation in green retrofit loan schemes.  <\/p><p><b>Additional Services<\/b><\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that under the additional services regime set out in the 2016 regulations credit unions can seek approval from the Central Bank to offer additional services such as current accounts and debit cards.  62 credit unions have been approved to provide current accounts.  <\/p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must be approved by the Central Bank to provide the additional services.  The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without approval. It is undertaking a technical review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank will commence a public consultation process during Q4 2021 &ndash; seeking views from interested stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review. <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[54353\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans he has to address the process of price walking in insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[54362\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action he is taking to address differential pricing in which insurance customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with a provider; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 99 together.<\/p>  <p>  Price walking is a form of differential pricing where consumers are gradually charged higher premiums, relative to the cost of providing the service, the longer they remain with a provider. This represents a de facto loyalty penalty on long-serving customers. In the context of this specific question this is an important issue for consumers of insurance services, and the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out a number of actions to address it.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Markets, is an important element of this and I am pleased that it published its Final Report and Public Consultation last July &ndash; some two months ahead of schedule.  The Report showed that the majority of motor and home insurance firms apply some form of differential pricing and that some of the pricing practices identified, including price walking, could result in unfair outcomes for some consumers.  Accordingly, the Central Bank has made a number of proposals, including to ban price walking in the motor and home insurance markets for personal customers.  <\/p>  <p>  These proposals represent a balanced approach that will protect customers who prefer to stay with their current insurer, while still allowing those who prefer to switch provider to receive discounts for doing so. As I have consistently stated on this issue, it is important to protect the ability of consumers to get a good deal, and to ensure that any proposals are tailored to the Irish market. I believe the proposed ban achieves this, and recognises that price-sensitive Irish customers value promotions for shopping around. This considered approach will also help facilitate any new market entrants who wish to offer discounts to attract business. <\/p>  <p>  Following its public consultation, the Central Bank intends to finalise its proposals and to introduce them from July next year. The Department of Finance has been examining the Bank&rsquo;s Final Report and considering ways to support this work. In order to ensure timely oversight of any new measures, the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will therefore require the Central Bank to report to the Minister for Finance about any steps taken to address price walking, and whether any further action may be needed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900059#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[54316\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has carried out a risk assessment regarding the winding down of the employment wage subsidy scheme and the potential impact on employment levels and the risk of corporate insolvencies; if his Department is considering a replacement scheme based on the principles of the successful German Kurzarbeit short-time work scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). It provides a subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.<\/p>  <p>  The cost to date (4th  November) of the EWSS is almost &euro;6.2 billion comprising of direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.349 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;843 million to 51,600 employers in respect of over 681,000 employees.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further re-calibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time, it is necessary to unwind and phase out this temporary, emergency support measure. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, on Budget Day, I announced the extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022, which ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business. <\/p>  <p>  The following are the broad parameters of this extension:<\/p>  <p>  - The current arrangements, including the enhanced rates of subsidy, will remain in place until November 30 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - For December 1 2021 to February 28 2022, the original two-rate subsidy of &euro;151.50 and &euro;203 will apply;<\/p>  <p>  - For March and April 2022, a single flat rate of &euro;100 will apply and the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI will be reinstated for these two months;<\/p>  <p>  - Businesses availing of the EWSS on 31 December 2021 will continue to be supported until 30 April 2022. The scheme will close to new employers from 1 January 2022. <\/p>  <p>  With the extension of EWSS to end April 2022, continued support will remain in place for six months after the lifting of most public health restrictions and two months after the planned cessation of the PUP.  It also means that a wage subsidy scheme will have been in place for over two years. By signalling the changes to EWSS at this time, it ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business. <\/p>  <p>  In determining the appropriate approach to adopt with regard the recalibration of the EWSS and the ultimate phasing out of this temporary, emergency support measure, appropriate data were not available at sufficient breadth and depth across the various sectors of the economy to enable the type of risk assessment mentioned by the Deputy to be carried out.  <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, consideration was given to a range of factors.  Such factors included the impact of the economic recovery on particular sectors, recent trends in EWSS statistics across different sectors, number of employers and employees supported by EWSS, the levels of employment and the trends in PUP, including the interaction and the flows between the EWSS and the PUP.  In addition, Revenue operational experience and insights in relation to the scheme, duly interpreted and provided at a macro level, also informed the process.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, as outlined in the Budget 2022 Economic and Fiscal outlook &ndash; current data confirms that the Government&rsquo;s policy response to the pandemic &ndash; essentially keeping workers close to the jobs market &ndash; has paved the way for a rapid rebound in the labour market. In addition, as part of the risk assessment published in Budget 2022, the risks related to SME indebtedness are taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  All of the factors and elements mentioned helped to inform the Government&rsquo;s decision to extend the EWSS in graduated form until 30 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the revised arrangements for EWSS strike a balance between helping those businesses which continue to need support, while recalibrating the scheme in light of the wider economic recovery. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to a replacement scheme similar to the German Kurzarbeit short-time work scheme, I would note that the Department of Social Protection, in addition to the PUP and other jobseeker payments, currently provides a Short-Time, Work Support scheme to support employees. This is a form of Jobseeker's Benefit and is an income support payment for people who have been temporarily placed on a shorter working week by their employer.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that the EWSS has been an extremely successful policy intervention during the pandemic and it played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees during this pandemic. I understand that, in relation to income supports and wage subsidy schemes, plans are being developed at official level to ensure that lessons learned from the crisis are captured for the longer term and that arrangements are put in place to be able to respond appropriately to any future large labour market shock. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[54424\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the communication he has had or meetings he has held with retail banks and insurance companies with respect to contributions through levies or otherwise to a 100% redress scheme for homes affected by defective concrete blocks as a result of MICA and pyrite; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1463","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>My Department maintains contact with both the Banking Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and the insurance sector on a on going basis.

Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister O&rsquo;Gorman has confirmed that he has asked his officials to reconvene the working group established to carry out that review at the earliest opportunity and we are both agreed that this is the most appropriate forum for the review. With this in mind, my officials will work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[54418\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900060#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to extending the highest 5% rate of the regional film development uplift for claims made after 31 December 2021; if there are similar or alternative proposals to encourage film production in regional areas as part of the film tax credit section 481; if additional supports can be considered to help expand and develop the increased level of film production taking place in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>Section 481 provides relief in the form of a corporation tax credit related to the cost of production of certain films.

It would also mean that Living City would, in effect, become a different scheme, one which would need an ex-ante cost benefit analysis where the cost implications are so substantial. In any event, the proposal would have the potential for greatly increased Exchequer costs and would raise State Aid concerns. <\/p><p>There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce. Taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government.

This section, as amended, provides Income Tax relief for certain individuals assigned during any of the tax years 2012 to 2022 to work in the State. The relief is commonly known as SARP (Special Assignee Relief Programme).<\/p><p>SARP provides for relief from Income Tax on 30% of income over &euro;75,000, subject to an upper income threshold, where applicable.

School fees of up to &euro;5,000 per annum and expenses incurred on one trip home per year, where they are paid for by the employer, are not subject to Income Tax, USC or PRSI.  <\/p><p>The scheme is an incentive designed to help reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies from abroad, to take up positions in the Irish-based operations, thereby facilitating skills transfer and the creation of jobs and the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland.

The change applied from 1 January 2019 for new entrants and from 1 January 2020 for existing recipients.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the aggregate number of jobs that were reported as created and retained as a result of the scheme has increased since 2018.

This combined total of 862 SARP-related jobs in 2019 represents a cost of &euro;44,000 per job created or retained, a decrease in cost per job compared with 2018, when there were 584 SARP supported jobs at an average cost of &euro;73,000 each.This represents a decrease in cost of over 39%. <\/p><p>In terms of the continuation of the scheme, it is important for the Deputies to note that Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy is based on export-led growth and Foreign Direct Investment has been, and continues to be, an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.

The competition for this talent is intense, particularly for the types of skills required to facilitate the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland.<\/p><p>The existence of similar (and indeed more attractive) special assignee type tax reliefs in a number of competitor jurisdictions creates a competitive disparity that would not be addressed if not for the continued existence of SARP.<\/p><p>Aside from enhancing our international competitiveness, the benefits of SARP, as detailed in the 2019 Indecon report on the measure, available on my Department's website, include:<\/p><p>-  Increased employment and retention of staff within SARP companies;<\/p><p>-  Associated additional investment in the economy;<\/p><p>-  Additional Corporation Tax receipts;<\/p><p>-  Additional PAYE receipts; and<\/p><p>-  R&amp;amp;D spillover activity.<\/p><p>In line with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, SARP will be reviewed before its sunset date of 31 December 2022.

The emergence of inflationary pressures in recent months is not unique to Ireland however, with the euro area flash estimate reaching 4.1 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  The recent increase in inflation is partly explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the &lsquo;normalisation&rsquo; of oil prices following their collapse last spring and the imbalance between supply and demand that emerged following re-opening. This has been compounded by global supply chain disruptions, including transport bottlenecks, input shortages (e.g. semi-conductors) and labour supply shortages in some sectors. <\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that inflation will moderate over the course of next year as temporary factors fade, demand stabilises and supply catches up. At the time of the Budget, inflation of around 2&frac14; per cent was projected for this year and next. However, the recent spike in international wholesale energy prices means there could already be some upside to these projections. A scenario analysis outlining the macroeconomic implications of higher than expected inflation is set out in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published with the Budget. <\/p>  <p>  Consistent with this outlook, the Commission and the ECB are confident that elevated inflation is linked to temporary factors, supply-side constraints and the recovery in demand as our economies reopen. That said, energy prices can entail wide-ranging consequences for inflation including for businesses and families. In recognition of the social impacts, many Member States have introduced targeted measures to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty. In framing Budget 2022, I was conscious of these cost of living pressures, and therefore announced a range of measures including targeted social welfare initiatives. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the European Commission has issued a Communication on Tackling Rising Energy Prices, and the matter was discussed at various Council configurations.

Let me state at the outset that I welcome the Commission&rsquo;s communication, as I believe that the timing is right for Europe to consider, and to debate, the future of our fiscal framework. <\/p>  <p>  The discussions on reform of the framework will be challenging, with a wide diversity of views across Member States. While these discussions will of course involve all 27 EU countries, as President of the Eurogroup, I will be working to try and find consensus on a way forward among euro area Member States. I am, therefore, conscious of the need to listen to and reflect the diversity of views across euro area countries.  <\/p>  <p>  Of course, as Ireland&rsquo;s Minister for Finance, I also have a national role and, on this basis, it is my intention that a submission be made to the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation on the future of the EU economic governance framework. <\/p>  <p>  In framing our submission, I am conscious that the upcoming discussions will take place against the backdrop of a number of fiscal challenges.  The most immediate of these is the challenge posed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the public finances of EU Member States. Strong coordinated policy actions at EU and national levels (including the activation of the General Escape Clause of the Stability and Growth Pact) helped to reduce the societal and economic impact of the pandemic.  While these measures were undoubtedly necessary and prudent, they have nevertheless resulted in significant increases in deficit and debt ratios throughout the EU. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of more medium-term fiscal and structural challenges were already visible on the horizon before the pandemic hit. Amongst these are the challenges posed by the so-called &lsquo;dual transitions&rsquo; to a digital and green economy. Concurrently, population ageing over the coming decades will also have a significant impact on the public finances. <\/p>  <p>  The structural budgetary challenges we are now facing, along with the economic interdependencies and risks which existed when the European Monetary Union was established, all speak to the continued need for fiscal rules at a European level.  However, such rules must be appropriately calibrated in order to remain credible.  The rules must also contain a degree of flexibility, to allow Governments to tackle unanticipated shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic.  Finally, any reformed fiscal framework must be able to accommodate the very significant public investment which will be needed to facilitate the dual transitions in a manner that ensures the sustainability of Member States&rsquo; public finances. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, effective economic and budgetary coordination remains a key building block for ensuring stability and growth in the EU and for strengthening the Economic and Monetary Union.  Maintaining the sustainability of public finances as an objective of the fiscal rules is essential in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":105,"content":"<p>Question No. 107 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[54117\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the controls he can put in place in relation to the marketing of crypto assets ahead of any EU directives coming into force, for example, the Markets in Crypto-assets and amending directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has issued warnings to consumers in 2017 and 2018, with the latest advice issued in April of 2021, on the risks of buying virtual currencies.<\/p><p>The Central Bank warnings outline the risks of buying or investing in &ldquo;virtual currencies&rdquo; (VCs): extreme volatility; absence of guarantees and safeguards associated with regulated financial services; and the possibility of losing all invested capital.<\/p><p>The warnings clearly state that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether have no legal tender status to be used as means of payment, and are not guaranteed or regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, or any other central bank in the EU.<\/p><p>As of 23 April 2021, the providers of certain services in relation to virtual assets will have to meet anti-money laundering and countering of financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) obligations, under part 4 of the CJA 2010 to 2021. <\/p><p>All VASPs (virtual asset service providers) established in Ireland are required to register with the Central Bank for these AML\/CFT purposes.<\/p><p>Finally, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission also updated their advice on purchasing and investing in digital and cryptocurrencies during June of this year, clearly outlining the risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD00900"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[53063\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the schemes and supports that are available at present for disabled drivers to acquire and or adapt their own car.","asker":"1520","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance does not provide any grants, schemes or supports for the purchase of a vehicle. <\/p><p>It administers the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme which provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to a certain limit) set against the purchase and use of an adapted car, and for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities.

In simple terms, the effect of the measure is that Irish tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from a foreign employment.<\/p>  <p>  The relief applies subject to certain conditions, which includes the requirement that the duties of a qualifying employment are performed wholly outside the State in a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement. There is an exception in respect of merely incidental duties which may be performed in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, in light of the unprecedented circumstances arising due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health restrictions to limit movement, for the tax years 2020 and 2021, a concessional treatment for such taxpayers would apply, whereby if employees are required to work from home in the State due to Covid-19, such days working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met. The effect of this concessional treatment allows individuals resident in the State and working for a non-resident employer, carry out their employment duties in the State and continue to pay tax in another jurisdiction.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been calls to place this concessional treatment on a statutory footing so that individuals who are resident in the State, but work outside the State for a non-resident employer, can continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State. <\/p>  <p>  During the debates on Finance Bill 2020, I undertook that this matter would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) for 2021. The resultant paper was discussed by the TSG as part of its deliberations on 8 September last.  The examination encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax. The review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective when having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers.

Relief is generally afforded by way of exemption or granting relief for foreign tax paid in the country of residence of the individual.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question relating to double-tax rules for cross-border workers, in the event that an individual does not qualify for Trans-Border Workers&rsquo; Relief he\/she may be entitled to relief from double taxation under the terms of the relevant Double Taxation Agreement, thus a double taxation charge would not arise in such circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Ireland is exceptional in having section 825A of the TCA in place; such a measure does not exist in many European countries that share land borders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[54317\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the percentage of workers aged under 25 years of age whose wages are subsidised through the employment wage subsidy scheme; if he will provide a breakdown on an economic sector by sector basis in respect of the total number of firms in receipt of the scheme as of 1 November 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that there were approximately 310,000 employees supported by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in September 2021, which is the most recent month for which complete payslip information from employers is available for analysis.

As the Deputy will be aware, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific businesses or individuals. This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive framework.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Government keenly understands the importance of consumers and businesses being able to access affordable insurance, and is working to improve the cost and availability of this vital financial service through 66 cross-departmental actions under the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This work is being prioritised by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Sub-Group meets regularly to review the implementation of this reform agenda, which is progressing well. The Implementation Report published last July shows that 34 of the 66 actions were complete.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to recent price changes for insurance, I would note that, according to Central Statistics Office (CSO) data for September 2021, motor insurance prices are continuing to decline. Motor insurance prices in September were 36.6% lower than their peak in July 2016; and 8.4% lower than when the Government&rsquo;s Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform was established in September 2020.  Notwithstanding this, I would like to assure the Deputies that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, which will be important for the sectors referenced in the question. <\/p>  <p>  This includes legislative proposals to reform the law on Occupiers&rsquo; Liability and the Duty of Care, which are expected to be brought to Government for approval shortly.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also working to bring forward legislation to enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which should lead to an increased number of claims being settled more cost-effectively. Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to work with colleagues to drive forward these reforms with a view to improving the insurance environment for consumers, businesses and community and voluntary groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[54432\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has made projections in relation to the expected change in corporation tax receipts.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>I am taking it that this question has been tabled in the context of Ireland joining 135 other member jurisdictions of the OECD\/G20 Inclusive Framework in reaching a high level agreement on a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitilisation of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  There are two pillars to the OECD agreement. Pillar One will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer. This means that, in effect, corporate tax revenue streams which now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the Exchequers of other countries when implemented.  Pillar Two will see the adoption of a new global minimum effective tax rate of 15% applying to multinational companies (MNEs) with global revenues in excess of &euro;750m.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners has estimated that the cost of the agreement could be up to &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. This  figure is included in the Stability Programme Update, the Summer Economic Statement (SES), and in the medium term forecast included in Budget 2022. Estimating the cost is an extremely challenging exercise, both in terms of timing and magnitude. For the purpose of calibrating this medium-term forecast, the impact of international tax reform is very tentatively estimated &ndash; in terms of revenue foregone &ndash; at &euro;2 billion relative to baseline by 2025; the revenue impact is phased in from 2023. <\/p>  <p>  In respect to the exercise to estimate the cost of the agreement, it is important to note that there have been significant changes in recent months to the original proposals, both in relation to Pillar One, in which there is now a higher re-allocation than was originally foreseen, and on Pillar Two through the adoption of a 15% minimum rate as well as the introduction of substance based carve-outs based on the carrying value of assets and payroll. The substance based carve-out is expected to offer relief to taxpayers from the minimum effective rate but this is difficult to estimate as it will be firm specific. Indeed, predicting how individual companies may react to a potential new tax regime is very difficult.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be stressed that while there is now a broad high level agreement in place on the main features of a solution, discussions are continuing and will continue into 2022 on how the agreement will be implemented in practice. For instance, the discussions on Pillar One will need to examine the rules in respect to reallocation from entities within a group. Further, it remains to be seen what additional tax will be paid by MNEs under Pillar Two when substance based carve-out rules are applied which can reduce the effective tax rate paid by an MNE. In terms of further complexity, the final agreement on these carve-outs include a 10 year transition period where the carve-out percentage is reduced year-on-year.<\/p>  <p>  A further consideration is that although there are two pillars to this Agreement, it is important to understand that they are intended as integral parts of a single agreed solution. How they interact and the degree to which this interaction influences business behaviour is very difficult to predict.<\/p>  <p>  For all these reasons, I do not believe that I yet have sufficient grounds to revise the working estimate of a potential annual cost of up to &euro;2 billion that I have used in assessing the potential impact of the agreement on the public finances.<\/p>  <p>  As technical discussions on the implementation framework continue, officials from my Department and from Revenue will keep the position under review and, when and if necessary, my Department will provide an update on how the agreement is expected to impact the public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD02800"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[54245\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if discussions are expected with senior officials of a bank (details supplied) regarding the future use of its soon to be vacated units in towns and villages across Ireland; if consideration has been given to the repurposing of these units as community digital hubs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, as Minister for Finance, I have no role in the commercial decisions made by any bank in the State.

The Act provides for a cut in the main rate of the tax and widening of the valuation bands to make the changes affordable.  This means that the majority of homeowners are likely to see either a decrease or no change in their LPT liability.  Where increases arise, the majority will be a single band, notwithstanding the significant increases in property values since 2013.  <\/p>  <p>  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax.  A qualifying person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax. Where a person qualifies for a full deferral then 100 per cent of the liability can be deferred. Where a person qualifies for partial deferral, then 50 per cent of the liability can be deferred. The balance of 50 per cent of the tax must be paid. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is charged on the deferred amount. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that for 2022 the deferral thresholds will  increase to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple. The thresholds for 50 per cent relief are &euro;30,000 (single) and &euro;42,000 (couple). In addition, the rate of interest charged on deferred LPT liabilities will reduce from 4 per cent to 3 per cent annually.<\/p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for or does not wish to avail of a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting. The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT is available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances. Throughout the pandemic, Revenue has engaged extensively with individual taxpayers experiencing financial pressures due to the pandemic to agree flexible arrangements that best suit their circumstances, including in respect of LPT liabilities and will continue to fully engage with taxpayers facing financial difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  The LPT is an effective, stable and sustainable source of revenue for the Local Government Sector. All property owners benefit from the essential local services LPT helps to fund. Accordingly, it is equitable that the cost of providing the services should be shared by as broad a spectrum of owners as possible.  It is unlikely that a charge levied solely on second and subsequent homes would generate sufficient income to replace the revenue from LPT.  This funding gap would ultimately need to be met by the Exchequer in the form of increased general taxation. Landlords faced with the prospect of increased charges could, in turn, pass on the resulting costs to tenants. This would exacerbate the already difficult housing situation, particularly in large urban centres. <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans along the lines suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":134,"content":"<p>Question No. 116 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[54310\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures taken in the Finance Bill to adjust tax bands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[54342\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the changes that have been made to tax bands and tax credits; the expected benefit of same to persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 121 together.<\/p><p>In Budget 2022 I announced a substantial income tax package and some changes to the Universal Social Charge (USC) that will ensure that every income-earner paying income tax or USC in 2022 will see an increase in their net income in 2022, all other factors being equal. This will support living standards as the economy continues to recover, while preserving a broad and stable income tax base, to ensure that our personal taxation system is both competitive and resilient.<\/p><p>From 1 January 2022, it is proposed that the main tax credits, that is, the personal tax credit, the employee tax credit and the earned income credit will be increased by &euro;50 each to &euro;1,700, broadly a 3% increase. In addition, it is proposed that the standard rate cut-off point for a single person will be increased by &euro;1,500 to &euro;36,800 (4% increase), with commensurate increases in the bands applying to married persons and civil partners.  <\/p><p>In relation to the USC, to ensure that a full-time worker on the minimum wage, who will benefit from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate from &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50, will remain outside the top rates of USC, the ceiling of the band for the 2% rate of USC will be increasing from &euro;20,687 to &euro;21,295 with effect from 1 January 2022. In addition, the reduced rate of USC for medical card holders will be extended for a further year. <\/p><p>To answer the Deputy's specific question regarding the expected benefit of these changes, I would note that the precise amount by which an individual will benefit will be dependent on their personal situation, such as their earnings, marginal tax rate and the tax credits they are eligible to claim based on their individual circumstances.

From the outset, I must state that it is not appropriate for the Minister for Finance to comment on the tax affairs of individual businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue uses a range of resources to identify instances of tax avoidance, which would include tax avoidance arising from the arrangements described in the Agreement between the Competent Authorities of Ireland and Malta.<\/p>  <p>  Those arrangements involved an exploitation of a mismatch of Irish and Maltese rules in relation to company residence and domicile, which could have led to income falling out of charge in Ireland and in Malta, resulting in double non-taxation of the income concerned. I cannot comment on the arrangements of any specific taxpayer. However, arrangements as described in the Christian Aid report are not arrangements that involve a mismatch of residence and domicile rules that would lead to double non-taxation, through amounts falling out of charge in both Ireland in Malta.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement was to deter the arrangements described in the Agreement. The Christian Aid report appears to confirm that the Agreement was effective in achieving that purpose&mdash; and I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not identified information that would suggest otherwise. As regards those arrangements or any other aggressive tax planning, I have repeatedly stated that I will not hesitate to propose legislation to address tax avoidance, where it may not be possible to address arrangements within the existing code. The Revenue Commissioners liaise with my Department on that basis, in relation to potential loopholes they identify.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners cannot comment directly or indirectly on the arrangements of a specific taxpayer. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; as a general statement and without their reference to, or implication in respect of, any specific case &ndash; that they do not provide confirmations or opinions to taxpayers on matters in respect of which they suspect there may be a tax avoidance purpose.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue is strongly committed to identifying and challenging tax avoidance, including schemes that would seek to rely on Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreements. Revenue has reviewed Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) network in relation to the possibility of arrangements, similar to those addressed by the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement, being implemented using a different DTA. Specifically, Revenue has considered Ireland&rsquo;s DTA with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been cited in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the absence of a generally-applicable corporate tax in the UAE, the UAE DTA contains provisions designed to prevent companies from qualifying as residents of the UAE for the purposes of the DTA. While Revenue will remain vigilant for indications of avoidance, they consider that DTA has been designed to prevent such possible use and that the risk of implementation of arrangements, similar to those addressed in the Competent Authority Agreement with Malta, is low in relation to the UAE DTA and other DTAs designed for restricted application.<\/p>  <p>  For my part, I have repeatedly demonstrated that I am committed to taking action to ensure the Irish tax code is in line with new and emerging international tax standards as agreed globally. The January 2021 Update to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap highlights the actions that have already been taken and will continue to be taken in this process of corporation tax reform.<\/p>  <p>  In this respect, it is important to remember that in recent Finance Acts, the Oireachtas has;<\/p>  <p>  - substantially progressed transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives through the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, and anti-hybrid rules;<\/p>  <p>  - introduced defensive measures against listed jurisdictions through enhanced Controlled Foreign Company Rules;<\/p>  <p>  - updated transfer pricing rules;<\/p>  <p>  - introduced legislation for OECD BEPS measures on mandatory disclosure rules; and<\/p>  <p>  - substantially widened the scope of the Exit Tax regime &mdash; with the result that, on the migration of a company from Ireland to another country of residence, the increase in the value of assets to the date of the company&rsquo;s departure will be chargeable to Irish tax.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be recognised that Ireland has a longstanding General Anti-Avoidance Rule, which goes beyond the standard required in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives.<\/p>  <p>  Further, in the Finance Bill 2021, we will complete the transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, with the introduction of interest limitation rules and anti-reverse hybrid rules. It is intended that these rules will take effect from 1 January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  This reform is not complete. As set out in the update to the Corporation Tax Roadmap,  there are commitments over the coming years to introduce a series of measures to further reform our corporate tax code, including through the introduction of measures to apply to outbound payments, further measures in regard to listed jurisdictions, as well as publishing a tax treaty policy statement with a particular focus on developing countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[54429\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total number of employees with gross pay in excess of &euro;100,000, &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000 who availed of tax relief on their pension contributions in 2019; his views on whether this is a judicious use of resources; if he will consider a review of the tax relief on pension contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that data in relation to incomes for 2019 is still being processed and consolidated. Once completed, analysis can be carried out as requested by the Deputy, reconciling taxpayers to a taxpayer unit basis (where jointly assessed couples are counted as one unit) and accounting for all income sources and pension contributions made. This analysis, which is necessary to estimate a cost associated with employee pension contributions at a taxpayer unit level, is anticipated to be completed by end 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As this is new data provided for by PAYE Modernisation, 2019 will be the earliest year for which this data will be available.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question if tax relief on pension contributions in respect of certain salary ranges is a judicious use of resources, I would make the following general observations. Like the majority of OECD countries, in terms of the tax treatment of supplementary pensions, Ireland operates an Exempt, Exempt, Tax (EET) system. This means that contributions to pensions are exempted from income tax (subject to age-related percentage and income limitations), pension fund gains are exempted from income tax but income from pension drawdown is taxed.<\/p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Pension Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) recently reviewed the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer. In its report published in November 2020, it noted that in common with most developed countries, fiscal support for private pension saving exists in Ireland. This support is provided by way of tax relief, with its inclusion in the tax code predating the foundation of the State.<\/p>  <p>  It observed that in providing incentives, States are motivated by the policy objective of increasing aggregate savings or encouraging citizens to provide for their retirement, by deferring a sufficient amount of income and consumption today to provide for their later years. This is based on an assumption that individuals require an incentive to lock-up savings until they retire given that alternative saving vehicles allow on-going access. <\/p>  <p>  It also noted that the tax treatment of pensions represents one of the largest Exchequer tax expenditures. However, in common with other countries operating an EET system, the exact cost of this is difficult to quantify due to the general nature of tax expenditures and also specific pension-related challenges, such as limited data availability on some features of the pension regime in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the policy objective for tax relief on pension contributions is to encourage individuals to save for retirement, to meet a target level of supplementary pension coverage and an income replacement target, and to assist in preventing an over reliance of State support for people in later life.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, we should seek to make overall progress in the area of pension provision in a manner that is comprehensive and surefooted.  That broad approach is what has informed recent action in this area including the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 which, in turn, led to the work of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group and the separate work of the Pensions Commission. Indeed, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has also been charged with considering the output from the Pensions Commission regarding sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of State Pension arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":147,"content":"<p>Question No. 121 answered with Question No. 117.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[54375\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who have availed of the help-to-buy scheme in Cork city and county in each of the years 2018 to 2020 and to date in 2021, in view of the extension to the scheme in Budget 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive is a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with a deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment.

Accordingly, Government has prioritised insurance reform through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. As the Deputy may be aware, the first Action Plan Implementation Report was published last July, and shows that work is progressing well to implement the Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which was realised several months ahead of schedule. Early data from PIAB suggests the Guidelines are having desired impact with awards level down by over 40%. It is my expectation that insurers will pass on these savings to customers in the shape of reduced premiums across their product lines, which is a public commitment they previously made to members of the Oireachtas. Minister Fleming also has had number of positive engagements with the CEOs of the main insurers operating here on the matter, and he intends to meet with them again later this month to review their ongoing progress and to remind them of commitments made.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the Central Bank recently published the first National Claims Information Database (NCID) report on employers' liability (EL), public liability (PL) and commercial property insurance. It demonstrated that while many businesses in Ireland are accessing affordable insurance, some are encountering difficulties. This report is a rich source of data which will assist in further policy formation. In addition to this, Government recently agreed the drafting of legislation which will help increase transparency and provide enhanced protections for consumers.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900061#WRD05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[53709\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will reduce the taxes on fuel and home heating oil similar to other EU countries (details supplied) to ease the pressure on vulnerable persons and hauliers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[54249\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the diesel fuel rebate for hauliers will be increased as an acknowledgement of the current price of fuel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 158 together.<\/p>  <p>  The final retail price of fuel is determined by a number of factors which include the costs of production, distribution, global market factors, international exchange rates, taxation, wholesale market contracts as well as individual retail pricing policies.<\/p>  <p>  The current spike in energy prices arises principally from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to home heating fuels and taxation, the Deputy will be aware that a reduced rate of VAT applies to all home heating fuels.  In relation to the Carbon Tax increase, I have delayed its application on home heating fuels until May 2022 to allow for the passage of the winter heating season.  In addition, in line with Government policy, the additional revenues raised from the increase in carbon tax have been allocated to expenditure measures which ensure a just transition through targeted social welfare measures, investment in energy efficiency and through funding for the agricultural sector.  This package is informed by ESRI research which finds that the net impact of the measures is progressive. The use of targeted welfare measures ensures that those most vulnerable to fuel poverty are protected.  <\/p>  <p>  For large scale diesel consumers such as those involved in the road haulage and public transport sectors, the Deputy will be aware that the Diesel Rebate Scheme was introduced by my predecessor in 2013. This Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators based on the retail price of diesel.  The scheme is designed to provide a  level of support when the retail price of auto diesel is relatively high.  The rebate kicks in when the price at the pumps goes above &euro;1.23 per litre; increasing gradually to a maximum rebate of 7.5c when diesel reaches &euro;1.43 per litre.  In Budget 2020, I provided for a temporary enhancement to the scheme in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry.  This involved a doubling of the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre.   In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, I have maintained this enhancement to the scheme which offers more generous conditions to essential users.  This measure is aimed at maintaining the competitiveness of the road haulage sector and minimising the impact for the sector and related businesses which rely on road haulage services.  Passenger transport also benefits from this scheme which is available to passenger bus operators.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE00600"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[54417\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to developing an application or website to assist with the administration of tax relief for remote workers announced as part of Budget 2022; if guidance is being developed to assist remote workers in calculating the number of days worked from home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>In line with Government policy to  facilitate and support remote working, on Budget Day, I announced that an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and internet services in respect of those incurred while working from home can be claimed by taxpayers.

The proposed reduction in the flat-rate addition to 5.5% for 2022 is a result of calculations on the basis of macro-economic data received from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for the three-year period 2019-21.  The methodology takes account of the final estimates of farming inputs, outputs and the VAT rate structures for 2019 and 2020, and a provisional forecast of agriculture inputs, outputs in 2021 as provided by the CSO, and the VAT rate structure for 2022.  The method of calculation of the flat-rate addition percentage is subject to audit by the European Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The reason for the annual review requirement is that, while it has been normal practice to compensate unregistered farmers in full for VAT incurred, over-compensation is not permitted under EU law.  The calculations under the most recent review show that full compensation can be achieved by decreasing the rate to 5.5%, and that this will have an estimated saving to the Exchequer of &euro;7m in 2022.  Thus, the Scheme will continue to provide full compensation to farmers using the Scheme following the proposed rate change on 1 January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that, as an alternative to using the Flat-Rate Farmer's Scheme, it is open to a farmer to decide to register for VAT.  A farmer who does this would be entitled to claim deductibility for the actual VAT incurred on all inputs into the farming business, in accordance with the VAT rules.  Of course, the farmer would also be obliged to charge normal VAT on all the businesses supplies\/sales, and to account for VAT regularly and submit regular VAT returns to Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inflation Rate","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[54358\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on inflation and the rising costs of living currently challenging persons; the measures being considered to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>While Covid-19 had a deflationary impact both in Ireland and internationally last year, inflation has picked up since the beginning of this year. The annual rate of HICP inflation is expected to reach 5.1 per cent in October &ndash; the highest rate since 2003. The emergence of inflationary pressures is not unique to Ireland however, with euro area inflation expected to reach 4.1 per cent in October. <\/p>  <p>  The recent rise in inflation is partly explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the &lsquo;normalisation&rsquo; of oil prices following their collapse last spring and the imbalance between supply and demand that emerged following re-opening. This has been compounded by global supply chain disruptions, including transport bottlenecks, input shortages (e.g. semi-conductors) and labour supply shortages in some sectors. More recently, increases in wholesale energy prices have put additional upward pressure on prices, with energy inflation of 18&frac12; per cent recorded in September. <\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that inflation will moderate over time as temporary factors fade, demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. The Department is forecasting inflation of 2&frac14; per cent this year and next. However, the recent spike in wholesale energy prices means that there could already be some upside to these projections. Indeed, a scenario analysis outlining the macroeconomic implications of higher than expected inflation is set out in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published with the Budget.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 contained a range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living, including a personal income tax package worth &euro;520m and a social welfare package of over &euro;550m. The fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week to compensate lower income households for the additional energy costs they are likely to incur due to an increase in the carbon tax. There were also increases in the allocation of Early Learning Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government is pursuing a broadly neutral budgetary policy in order to contain domestic inflationary pressures.  It is crucial that we do not have an inflation &lsquo;chain reaction&rsquo; which would damage our international cost competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[54244\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding his engagement with the insurance sector specifically related to persons and businesses that operate recreational facilities and outdoor activities; if his attention has been drawn to businesses being forced to close due to prohibitive insurance costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[54212\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the challenges faced by organisations and businesses in the leisure, sporting and charity sectors in accessing affordable public liability insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[54336\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans he has to address the difficulties currently arising in securing insurance for outdoor sports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[54714\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the work that is being undertaken to assist higher risk sports such as climbing and water sports to access affordable insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 134, 150 and 162 together.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, I wish to assure the House that I am very much aware of the issues of insurance affordability and availability facing many sectors, particularly the leisure industry, which provides such an important contribution to the well-being of our society and economy in general. However, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland have any influence over the pricing or provision of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to any individual business or group, as this is a commercial matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance, the Solvency II Directive. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputies that the Government is committed to improving the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups. As the Deputies may be aware, the Government recently published the first Action Plan for Insurance Reform Implementation Report, which shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions contained within the Action Plan now complete. The Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which oversees the implementation of the Action Plan, is fully focussed on the delivery of its remaining objectives. Of particular importance to the leisure and sporting sectors is that the Department of Justice is bringing forward proposals to reform the Occupiers Liability Act and the Duty of Care. This is particularly relevant as it has been identified as key in helping address &lsquo;slips, trips and falls&rsquo; issues which are very prevalent in footfall-intensive areas such as the leisure industry and activity-related pursuits.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key aspects of the reform agenda which has already been delivered is the implementation of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines, which were introduced six months ahead of schedule. These have significantly lowered award levels for many categories of common injuries; early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development and it is my hope that this trend will continue, thus resulting in lower insurance costs.  In recent meetings with Minister of State Fleming, the main insurance firms in the Irish market have indicated that they will begin to reduce premiums in response to this development. Minister Fleming will again meet with CEOs of the major insurance providers shortly to review their ongoing response to this and other key reforms.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputies that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy aim for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan will have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inflation Rate","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02100"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[54351\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the discussions he has had with his EU colleagues in the context of addressing the issue of inflation throughout the European Union; if corrective measures are required or are likely to be required in the short to medium-term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[54718\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects the Eurozone countries to address the issues such as inflation now emerging throughout the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[54730\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his EU colleagues continue to monitor issues likely to impact on this and other European economies with particular reference to price hikes which appear to have emerged with increasing frequency; the extent to which he and his colleagues monitor their origins; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 268 and 279 together.<\/p>  <p>  At both the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings, my fellow Ministers and I work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank to take stock of the latest economic situation, including inflation developments throughout the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The economic recovery throughout this year has been robust, with recent indicators pointing to strong growth. This momentum reflects our coordinated policy support, successful vaccine rollout and the boost to reforms and investment now that recovery funding has started to flow. Indeed, growth figures for the third quarter show that the euro area is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels of output.<\/p>  <p>  However, the sharp rebound in global demand and persisting production and transport disruptions has brought elevated rates of inflation. The latest Eurostat estimates point to euro area annual inflation of 4.1 per cent in October. This was largely driven by energy inflation, which increased to an estimated 23.5 per cent. Pandemic-related effects, such as the impact of temporary VAT reductions, and technical factors, such as measurement issues, added further volatility.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures point to inflation, including energy prices, remaining high over the course of the year, before gradually easing next year. The ECB projects inflation to average 2.2 per cent this year and decline to rates of 1.7 and 1.5 per cent in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Both the Commission and the ECB are confident that elevated rates of inflation are linked to temporary factors, supply-side constraints and the recovery in demand as our economies reopen.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the ECB has an independent mandate to maintain price stability, and uses the range of monetary policy instruments to target an inflation rate of 2 per cent over the medium-term. The ECB has stated that the outlook for inflation over the medium-term remains subdued. Core inflation &ndash; which strips out energy and non-processed food inflation &ndash; was 2.1 per cent in October.<\/p>  <p>  That said, energy prices can entail wide-ranging consequences for inflation and raise costs for businesses and families. In recognition of the social impacts, many Member States have introduced targeted measures to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty. In framing Budget 2022, I was conscious of these cost of living pressures and announced a range of measures including targeted social welfare initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, at an EU level, the Commission has issued a Communication on Tackling Rising Energy Prices, and the matter was discussed at various Council configurations. The Communication emphasises the broad nature of the impact and policy response.<\/p>  <p>  In short, my fellow Finance Ministers and I all agree that this is an important issue and that we need to continue monitoring inflation and energy price developments and the potential implications of these for our economies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":180,"content":"<p>Question No. 131 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":181,"content":"<p>Question No. 132 answered with Question No. 79.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[54341\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900062#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the assistance available to assist first-time buyers in the property market in the context of Budget 2022; the number of persons these measures will benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the assistance available to assist first-time buyers in the property market in the context of Budget 2022, I can only answer in respect of taxation measures.

Direct expenditure measures in this areas are a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. <\/p>  <p>  The previous tax relief in respect of rent paid was abolished in Budget 2011 and it is no longer available to those that commenced renting for the first time from 8 December 2010. This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued. The view of the independent Commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would very likely be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the cost pressure on tenants.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97m per annum, and it is likely that this figure would be even higher today were a similar scheme to be put in place. The refundable element mentioned by the Deputy would potentially add further to the cost. <\/p>  <p>  Proposals for new tax incentive measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to these considerations, the case for introducing a refundable tax credit as outlined by the Deputy is not a strong one from my Department's perspective. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy will be aware, the Government's  'Housing for All' plan is intended to deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs, including those who wish to rent at an affordable price.

Therefore, where an employer issues more than one qualifying incentive in a year then only the first of those incentives qualifies for this exemption.

However, certain exemptions will expire on 31 December 2021 and will not be available for the new valuation period. These include the exemptions for properties in unfinished housing estates; for properties purchased as a home during 2013; and for unsold properties held by builders or developers and new or unused properties purchased from a builder or developer.<\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Interdepartmental Review of the LPT recommended that all of the LPT exemptions should be reviewed regularly and kept to a minimum in order to keep the base broad and minimise the impact on those paying the tax, an approach the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight endorsed in its Scrutiny Report on the review of LPT of September 2019. In its 2019 report the LPT Review Group noted the demand level for residential property and the small number of unfinished estates remaining and concluded that there was no objective justification for continuation of the unfinished homes LPT exemption and accordingly recommended that it be allowed to lapse.<\/p>  <p>  In reaching this conclusion the Group noted that, according to information provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, there had been a 91% reduction in the number of unfinished developments since 2010 from almost 3,000 to 256. I understand that of the 256 developments surveyed, the number of developments classified as &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; fell further to 124 developments nationally in a 2020 survey which is a 96% reduction from the initial number of unfinished developments surveyed in 2010. Ending this exemption helps to maintain the base for the tax and is consistent with the principle underlying the LPT that exemptions should be kept to a minimum so the rate can be kept as low as possible for those liable to pay the tax.<\/p>  <p>  I would note that revenue from the LPT accrues to local authorities and supports the provision of local services. Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm, which benefit the wider community. The proper functioning of these services is important for the wellbeing of every community and household. These include fire and emergency services; road maintenance and cleaning; street lighting; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions and business support services, as well as libraries, parks, and other recreation and cultural public amenities.

In most cases, a lender is legally required under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make sure that a mortgage applicant has mortgage protection insurance in place before granting a mortgage loan.  This is an important statutory provision which is designed to protect the borrower's dependants and their home should the borrower die before the mortgage has been repaid. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases, as a statutory measure, such protection is not necessary or would be inappropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation such as where the borrower belongs to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to a life insurer, or would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally.  In such circumstances, there is no statutory requirement on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance.  Nevertheless, it may also be the case that, in circumstances where there is no specific statutory obligation on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance in association with a housing loan, an individual mortgage lender may, as a matter of its own commercial policy, still require a mortgage borrower to put in place such an insurance policy as a condition for obtaining mortgage credit.  That would be a commercial decision as opposed to a statutory requirement for an individual mortgage lender and it is not possible for me to instruct lenders on their commercial lending policies or their commercial decisions on any individual mortgage application, including the insurance and other security they require either in respect of the borrower or the secured property in relation to a mortgage loan.  While I cannot involve myself in the commercial decisions lenders may make in respect of mortgage applications, I previously wrote to Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) for its views and any information it can provide in relation to this particular issue. BPFI indicated in its reply that on an annual basis around 2% of primary home mortgages were provided without the requirement for mortgage protection insurance (utilising one of the exemptions as provided for in section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act) and that on an annual basis only 0.05% of mortgage applications were refused due to the fact that the applicant did not put in place an acceptable policy of mortgage insurance.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that if a person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, including the requirement for the regulated entity to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers, the consumer can also complain directly to the regulated entity and, if they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900063#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[54333\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900063#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has had recent discussions with the Central Bank in relation to the need to ensure an adequate retailed banking system throughout all regions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>The retail financial services sector is undergoing a major period of change.

REITs are collective investment vehicles designed to hold rental investment properties in a tax neutral manner. The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. REITs are required to distribute 85% of all property income profits annually to investors. <\/p>  <p>  A REIT is generally not chargeable to capital gains tax (CGT) accruing on the disposal of assets of its property rental business, subject to certain exceptions.  However a REIT is subject to CGT if it realises a gain on:<\/p>  <p>  -  any asset that has been developed by the REIT to the extent that the development cost exceeds 30 per cent of the market value of the asset at the time the development commenced, where the asset is then disposed of within 3 years of completion of the development, and<\/p>  <p>  -  the disposal of any assets which are not held for the purposes of the property rental business.<\/p>  <p>  While REITs are generally not chargeable to capital gains tax accruing on the disposal of its property rental assets, they are subject to restrictions not placed on other companies that invest in Irish property. These restrictions include a requirement to distribute 85% of all property income profits annually to investors and to maintain a property to financing costs ratio of 1.25:1.<\/p>  <p>  An Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. The legislation was introduced to address concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to invest in Irish property. Investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.<\/p>  <p>  As IREFs are investment undertakings, investors are taxed in a similar manner to other investment undertakings. Irish residents investing in IREFs are subject to exit tax at 41% on income\/gains from IREFs, just as they are taxed on income\/gains from funds generally. USC and PRSI do not apply to this income. IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions to non-resident investors. This is the standard rate of income tax and is deemed an appropriate rate to apply to non-resident investors. In some circumstances the withholding tax can be reduced by double taxation treaties.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, officials in my Department produced a report on REITs and IREFs as respects their investment in the Irish property market.  The report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group and published in July 2019. It provided a basis for policy discussions and the amendments which were introduced in Finance Act 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct DWT to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units.

According to the ECB &lsquo;flash estimate&rsquo;, the annual rate of HICP inflation is expected to reach 5.1 per cent in October &ndash; the highest rate since February 2003. The emergence of inflationary pressures is not unique to Ireland however, with euro area inflation expected to reach 4.1 per cent in October. <\/p>  <p>  The increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is partly explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time. These include &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the &lsquo;normalisation&rsquo; of oil prices following their collapse last spring and the imbalance between supply and demand that has emerged following the re-opening of the economy. This has been compounded by global supply chain disruptions, including transport bottlenecks, input shortages (e.g. semi-conductors) as well as labour supply shortages in some sectors. More recently, increases in the wholesale price of oil and gas have put additional upward pressure on prices, with energy inflation of around 18&frac12; per cent recorded in September. <\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, inflation is expected to continue to rise over the rest of the fourth quarter and average 2&frac14; per cent for 2021 as whole. The most likely scenario is that inflation will moderate over the course of next year however as some of these temporary factors fade, demand stabilises and supply catches up. At the time of the Budget, inflation of 2&frac14; per cent was projected for 2022. However, the spike in international wholesale energy prices since the Budget 2022 macroeconomic forecasts were finalised means there could already be some upside to these projections. Indeed, a scenario analysis outlining the macroeconomic implications of higher than expected inflation is set out in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published with the Budget.<\/p>  <p>  Needless to say, significantly higher inflation than already projected for next year would have significant impacts on the wider economy and public finances. At the household level real incomes could be squeezed, while at the firm level higher input costs would affect competitiveness. Meanwhile persistently higher inflation could trigger higher interest rates (including a policy response by the ECB), which would have implications for Government financing costs as well as for mortgage interest costs. In light of these risks, my Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments over the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900063#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900063#WRF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[54414\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900063#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the discussions he and his officials have had with a bank (details supplied) regarding the decision by the bank to close branches across the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[54386\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900063#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the discussions he and his officials have had with a bank (details supplied) regarding the decision by the bank to close branches across the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 250 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, as Minister for Finance, I have no role in the commercial decisions made by any bank in the State.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public\/stakeholder consultation. Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market.

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 29 October, almost 273,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties. Surveys are complete or underway in County Offaly in Brosna, Shinrone, Mount Heaton and areas close to the county boundary with Tipperary. <\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Offaly through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 29 October, 388 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCPs are installed at Killavilla Community Centre, Seir Kieran Community Hall (12km from premises referred to), Coolderry Community Hall, Shannon Harbour, Primo Coaches, Kilclonfert Community Centre, Ballycommon Telework and Training Centre, Irish Parachute Club and Croghan Community Hall.

The transport sector, which accounts for almost 20% of Ireland's greenhouse emissions annually and which has a heavy reliance on fossil fuel usage, has an important role to play in this national decarbonisation effort.<\/p><p>The movement of goods by road is the second biggest source of transport emissions after private car use, and without significant policy intervention these types of emissions are predicted to rise. <\/p><p>Utilising the most efficient and lowest emitting vehicles is of course essential in limiting freight emissions. For this reason, Ireland is very supportive of the introduction of new EU Regulations that set maximum fleet emission averages for new HDVs. New vehicles must emit 15% and 30% less CO2  by 2025 and 2030 respectively relative to average emissions over the period July 2019 to June 2020.  Similar legislation has proved to be a very effective approach in other jurisdictions (e.g. Japan, the USA and Canada) and has already been demonstrated to deliver marked emission reductions with cars\/vans in Europe. <\/p><p>As well as making the vehicles more efficient, lower emitting fuels must be employed. Although the EURO VI standard for HDVs represents a considerable improvement over older and more polluting EURO standards, for climate and air quality reasons Ireland must begin to move beyond the use of fossil fuels. The recent Climate Action Plan sets a target of 3,500 low-emission trucks in the fleet by 2030, on the basis that the technology pathway for decarbonising HGVs is still developing and not as clear as it is for private cars. Policy supports for decarbonising the sector reflect this and are not technology-specific with a purchase grant, reduced tolls available to hydrogen, electric, and gas-powered vehicles alike. <\/p><p>For HGVs, where electrification is not likely in the short term, emissions reductions will be achieved in the interim through:<\/p><p>- Increasing the blend rate for biodiesel to 20% and bioethanol to 10% by 2030  <\/p><p>- Developing robust supply chains, including sustainable sourcing of biofuel blends <\/p><p>- Supporting technological progress as viable vehicle\/fuel alternatives come to market  <\/p><p>- Promoting greater eco-practices within the HGV sector  <\/p><p>- Examining the feasibility of developing logistics hubs near urban centres to consolidate and rationalise freight transport, taking account of safety and air quality benefits  <\/p><p>- Supporting EU regulations that promote more stringent HGV vehicle emission standards  <\/p><p>- Complying with the provision of EU mandatory alternative fuel infrastructure deployment targets  <\/p><p>- From 2025, green hydrogen may offer a viable pathway for HGVs. <\/p><p>Our focus remains on delivering finite resources to removing our reliance on fossil fuels in the HGV sector and support the uptake of new lower emitting alternatives.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900065#WRH05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900065#WRH05200"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[53962\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900065#WRH05300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a course (details supplied) will be abolished; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>The requirement to have a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) is set out under EU law and applies to nationals of Member States and to nationals of third countries who are employed or used by an undertaking established in a Member State. <\/p>  <p>  EU Directive 2003\/59\/EC, which introduced driver CPC and which was updated in 2018 by EU Directive 645 of 2018, is transposed into Irish law by SI 359 of 2008. <\/p>  <p>  Following the initial CPC qualification, professional drivers are required to complete periodic training.

There is also an ability to transport any of these three units to an island on the Sligo based Coast Guard Rescue helicopter. There are currently 17 strategically placed Coast Guard units around the coast who provide cliff rescue capabilities. There has been further development of these units in recent years with the issuing of new equipment.<\/p>  <p>  A Value for Money review of the Coast Guard service, published in 2012, recommended the continuation of boat and shoreline rescue service and cessation of cliff training for the Bunbeg unit which is twinned with Tory Island. The strategic decision was to retain cliff rescue services in neighbouring CGUs, Mulroy and Killybegs.  The recommendation arose principally because of the non-utilisation of the cliff service balanced against the safety considerations of delivering a highly technical and intrinsically hazardous activity. <\/p>  <p>  The Coast Guard, having monitored the demand for cliff rescue services has noted that the level of call outs responded to by Bunbeg \/ Tory Island CGU does not justify the maintenance of a cliff rescue service. For a CGU to engage in a high risk activity that demands a high level of resources in terms of training time, equipment and supervision, the benefits must clearly outweigh the risks.

A new Programme for the period 2021 to 2025 was published on 4th February 2021.  The budget for the RAP in 2021 is &euro;21.3m and the airports that will benefit from related supports are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West.  In addition to targeting funding at safety and security projects and activities, the scope of the new programme has been expanded to encourage airports to reduce emissions and build climate resilience.  <\/p><p>Allocations for each airport have yet to be determined this year.  In addition to RAP funding, these airports are also receiving support in 2021 through a State aid support scheme to help address liquidity issues at airports as a result of COVID-19.  As part of this package, up to &euro;6m is available to the same airports.  Total funding allocations will be determined shortly following the completion of an assessment of airports' financial forecasts for 2021.<\/p><p><b>Emergency Subvention<\/b><\/p><p>Waterford Airport had been eligible for funding under the previous RAP, up until 2016 when all remaining scheduled flights ceased at the airport.  In order to avoid liquidation, the airport sought emergency subvention from the Department of Transport in December 2017.  Between 2018 and 2020 four emergency payments of &euro;375k each were provided, outside of the RAP, to the airport in order to allow time for the consideration of future options at the airport, including a proposal to expand its runway.  <\/p><p><b><\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>2016 <\/th>       <th>2017 <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>       <th>2019 <\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>       <th>2021 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal  <\/td>       <td>&euro;807,909 <\/td>       <td>&euro;667,874 <\/td>       <td>&euro;896,043 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,512,858 <\/td>       <td>&euro;826,105 <\/td>       <td>TBD <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry <\/td>       <td>&euro;937,557 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,657,991 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,385,694 <\/td>       <td>&euro;3,196,287 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,655,506 <\/td>       <td>TBD <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Knock <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,933,414 <\/td>       <td>&euro;3,199,355 <\/td>       <td>&euro;4,176,106 <\/td>       <td>&euro;9,482,903 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,236,894 <\/td>       <td>TBD <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,038,596 <\/td>       <td>&euro;0 <\/td>       <td>&euro;750,000 <\/td>       <td>&euro;375,000 <\/td>       <td>&euro;375,000 <\/td>       <td>&euro;0 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>TBD: To be determined.

The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.<\/p>  <p>  To date in 2021, over &euro;65m has been provided in grants to support the purchase of electric cars. By year end, this will represent almost a doubling of the allocated supports to EVs.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, the EV percentage of overall car registrations has increased significantly this year and represented over 15% to end Q3 2021. Government is on track as regards the number of vehicles which need to be sold in 2021 to reach its projected annual EV target as set out in the CAP 2019. As of 30 September, there were 45,423 EVs registered in the national fleet.<\/p>  <p>  In the past year, many new BEVs with ranges of over 400km on a single charge have been introduced to the Irish market. Range anxiety is no longer an issue for electric vehicle purchasers, and while PHEVs provided an interim option, but emit both CO2 and air pollution emissions, this interim option is no longer necessary. Government supports should be provided to full electric vehicles, which will be the most effective means of reaching our carbon reduction pathway.<\/p>  <p>  The EV Purchase Grant Scheme was updated earlier this year to support the most efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles on the market. Support in the form of government funding is being refocused to prioritise battery electric cars. Grants for these EVs continued at a rate of &euro;5000 whereas from the 1st of July 2021, the value of the purchase grant for PHEVs changed from &euro;5,000 to &euro;2,500.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I announced after the budget that grant support for PHEVs will be removed from 1 January 2022. Any PHEV which registers for the grant in accordance with the scheme rules before this date will be approved and the commitment carried forward into Q1 2022. However, from 1 January 2022 the SEAI will no longer accept grant applications in respect of PHEVs. <\/p>  <p>  For the top 10 PHEVS sold in 2020, four are high cost vehicles for which a grant would not be applicable and two have a direct BEV equivalent, that would be more useful in terms of decarbonising the car fleet. Of the four remaining, three are made by manufacturers that have an equivalent size BEV model and only one model has no BEV alternative in its range. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Terms and Conditions of the grant process, drawdowns normally need to be made by year end (31 Dec). However, due to the slowdown in global car manufacturing, I am extending this drawdown date to 31 March 2022, to allow time for customers to take final possession of the vehicle. <\/p>  <p>  A range of incentives are in place to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles including:  <\/p>  <p>  - VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 for BEVs;  <\/p>  <p>  - A grant of up to &euro;600 towards the installation cost of a domestic charge point for new and second-hand BEVs or PHEVs;  <\/p>  <p>  - A low rate of motor tax; <\/p>  <p>  - BEV and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles (greater off-peak rates also apply to the M50 toll); <\/p>  <p>  - BEVs qualify for a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate up to &euro;50,000 without mileage conditions; <\/p>  <p>  - BEV\/PHEVs and their associated recharging infrastructure qualify under the ACA scheme and; <\/p>  <p>  - A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi\/hackney\/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric with up to &euro;20K available for a new BEV, &euro;25K for a new wheelchair accessible BEV and &euro;15K for a new wheelchair accessible PHEV.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900067#WRK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":450,"content":"<p>Question No. 233 answered with Question No. 232.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haulage Industry","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900067#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[54760\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900067#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if urgent consideration will be given to the issues outlined in detailed correspondence from a representative organisation (details supplied) in relation to the serious difficulties facing this sector at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>The correspondence referred to is addressed to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications.

This Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators based on the retail price of diesel.  The scheme is designed to provide a  level of support when the retail price of auto diesel is relatively high.  The rebate kicks in when the price at the pumps goes above &euro;1.23 per litre; increasing gradually to a maximum rebate of 7.5c when diesel reaches &euro;1.43 per litre.  In Budget 2020, I provided for a temporary enhancement to the scheme in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which specifically prohibits Member States from doing so. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by various groups regarding the cost and availability of insurance.

This is an encouraging development; it is my hope that this trend will continue and result in lower costs for businesses.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers.

It is my understanding that HomeBond is one of the providers of latent defect insurance, also referred to as structural defect insurance (SDI). This type of cover provides protection against defects that occur in the post-construction phase and is a 10 year warranty product. The objective of structural defect insurance is to provide cover for a finite length of time in respect of the repair of major structural defects in new buildings. However, I am informed that Homebond withdrew its pyrite cover in 2011 on foot of a High Court decision which held the supplier of construction material liable for damage caused by pyrite rather than the developer. This was upheld in 2014 by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. Therefore, Homebond does not cover material defects, i.e. faults in construction which arise from defective building materials. Homebond&rsquo;s SDI covers the work carried out by the builder but not the materials used in construction, such as those set out in the question. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that Mica damage is not an insured peril and is therefore not covered in standard home insurance policies. Policy wordings generally exclude damage arising from faulty workmanship, defective design or the use of defective materials. It is also my understanding that normal house insurance does not cover defective construction materials &ndash; generally this is confined to accidental damage to structure or contents. Insurers will take a risk-based approach to the provision and pricing of insurance and under the insurance regulatory framework Government cannot intervene in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  In order to improve consumers&rsquo; recourse to insurance for housing defects, it is important to recognise that insurers will look to the overall building regulation, standards and the legal environment.  Accordingly, this is primarily a construction standards and building materials issue which falls under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. <\/p>  <p>  Government fully recognises the difficulties facing many homeowners.

The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.<\/p><p>In relation to PQ 54680, section 32 of Finance Bill 2021 amends the definition of &ldquo;eligible expenditure&rdquo; in section 481 to confirm that payments made directly by a qualifying company, to an individual involved in the provision of labour-only services for the purposes of the production of a qualifying film, may qualify as eligible expenditure. <\/p><p>This amendment has arisen as a result of the move to a self-assessment basis through Finance Act 2018. This required a substantial rewriting of section 481 legislation and it was subsequently identified that the amended definition of &lsquo;eligible expenditure&rsquo; excluded expenditure on individuals providing a labour only service.  Payments in respect of such individuals, which could include actors, directors and crew, had always qualified for section 481 relief, and this treatment was expressly stated in previous Revenue guidance. The Finance Bill 2021 amendment therefore provides confirmation of the existing standard industry practice that expenditure on individuals providing a labour only service on the production of a qualifying film may be qualifying expenditure, subject to the other terms and conditions of the credit. It is not intended that such an amendment would encourage a particular form of employment status.<\/p><p>In regard to PQ 54679, there is no expected Exchequer cost of the amendment.  It is expected to be cost neutral on the basis that there is no change in existing policy or practice <\/p><p>It is essential that there is compliance with all applicable employment obligations including legislative obligations and policies, not only in the audiovisual industry, but all industries. To grow the audiovisual sector in Ireland, the sector needs to provide quality and sustained employment and training opportunities. This is reflected in the requirement for an undertaking of quality employment introduced in Finance Act 2018. The undertaking commits applicants to compliance with all relevant employment legislation. These conditions apply not only to the producer company but also to the qualifying company. Should a producer company or qualifying company fail to adhere to a condition or obligation specified in a certificate, the Culture certificate may be rendered invalid and any credit claimed may be subject to recoupment by Revenue.<\/p><p>Revenue also engages regularly with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), across a range of industries, to address any misclassification of individuals as &lsquo;self-employed&rsquo; when &lsquo;employee&rsquo; status would have been more appropriate. Together with the DSP and the WRC, they have updated the Code of Practice for Determining Employment Status which was published in July 2021.  The Code aims to be of benefit to employers, employees, independent contractors and legal, financial and HR professionals. It is also aimed at investigators, decision-makers and adjudicators in the DSP, Revenue, the WRC, their respective appeals bodies, and the courts. Its purpose is to provide a clear understanding of employment status, taking into account current labour market practices and developments in legislation and caselaw. The Code highlights that there is no single clear legal definition of &lsquo;employment&rsquo; or &lsquo;self-employment&rsquo; under EU or Irish law and also emphasises that &ldquo;the reality behind the contract&rdquo; is what determines employment status. <\/p><p>In addition, there has been positive progress in relation to negotiations between employer and worker representatives in the sector in the past year. A modernised Crew Agreement was introduced in January 2021 which promotes good practice, regularises evolving work practices and provides for an industry pension scheme operating under the Construction Workers Pension Scheme (CWPS). This Agreement includes a monitoring structure to oversee the operation of the agreement, and a commitment to developing the first Work\/Life Balance policy for the film and television industry. The Agreement acts as a framework for the industry covering all crew grades except film construction.<\/p><p>I understand that a Construction Crew Agreement is also under active negotiation, and my officials will continue to monitor progress in this regard.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through the Workplace Relations Committee (WRC).<\/p><p>In relation to PQ 54678, as the level of future investment in the film industry is unknown, there is no basis available from tax returns or other data available to Revenue to accurately project the potential cost of the measure in 2022.

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. <\/p><p>In September 2021,  which is the most recent month for which complete payslip information from employers is available for analysis, 27,500 employers received payments through the EWSS in respect of almost 312,000 employees, at a cost of &euro;448.6m (&euro;391.3m in direct subsidy and &euro;57.3m in PRSI foregone). <\/p><p>The cost to date (4th November) is almost &euro;6.2 billion, comprising of direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.35 billion and PRSI forgone of almost &euro;850 million to 51,600 employers in respect of over 681,000 employees.  <\/p><p>Of the total expenditure, 2020 accounts for approximately &euro;1.64 billion (&euro;1.39 billion direct subsidy and almost &euro;250 million in PRSI foregone) and 2021 accounts for approximately &euro;4.56 billion (&euro;3.96 billion  in direct subsidy and almost &euro;600 million in PRSI foregone).<\/p><p>It is widely acknowledged that the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees during this pandemic.<\/p><p>Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time, it is necessary to unwind and phase out this temporary, emergency support measure. That is why, on Budget Day, I announced the extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022. This ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business.<\/p><p>The following are the broad parameters of this extension:<\/p><p>- The current arrangements, including the enhanced rates of subsidy, will remain in place until November 2021;  <\/p><p>- For December 2021 to February 2022, the original two-rate subsidy of &euro;151.50 and &euro;203 will apply; <\/p><p>- For March and April 2022, a single flat rate of &euro;100 will apply and the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI will be reinstated for these two months; <\/p><p>- Businesses availing of the EWSS on the 31st of December 2021 will continue to be supported until the 30th of April 2022. The scheme will close to new employers from 1 January 2022.<\/p><p>Essentially, these arrangements will ensure that the EWSS will remain in place for six months after the removal of most public health restrictions and for over two months after the PUP ceases to exist.<\/p><p>It is estimated that the cost of extending EWSS for the six month period November 2021 until April 2022, in the graduated form that I outlined, will be in the region of &euro;1.26 billion, with 2021 accounting for &euro;580 million and 2022 accounting for &euro;680 million.

The existing legislation means that there is no incentive for certain taxpayers to come forward in advance of a Revenue compliance intervention.

However, it is already possible for taxpayers to have the penalties applying to offshore settlements reduced for co-operating with the compliance intervention.  The nature of the behaviour leading to a tax default is also taken into account in determining the quantum of the penalty &ndash; that is, whether the default was deliberate or careless, and whether the careless default had or did not have &ldquo;significant consequences&rdquo; (where the tax underpayment was more than 15% of the taxpayer&rsquo;s overall liability for that taxhead). <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that these proposed changes will encourage voluntary compliance and as a result will increase the number of settlements agreed with Revenue in offshore cases.

According to the most recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office, between July and August 2021, the national Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) increased by 2.2 per cent, while prices increased by close to 11 per cent in the year to August 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  These rises in residential property prices in recent months, while concerning, are likely due to increasing activity amongst potential home-buyers as public health restrictions were eased. Along with an unwinding of savings built-up during lockdown, demand has manifested in an increase in the volume of purchases of new homes, typically more expensive than second-hand homes.  <\/p>  <p>  While the Government is very conscious of pressures in the housing market, including the potential for a faster unwinding of excess savings and construction inflationary pressures due to global supply chain disruptions, the underlying factors driving house price inflation in Ireland at present are primarily due to insufficient supply.  <\/p>  <p>  The current inflationary pressures are also fundamentally different to periods in the past, such as the credit fuelled house price inflation in the years prior to 2008. Since then macro-prudential rules were introduced to the mortgage market to safeguard against the worst of potential shocks and operating with a constraining effect on the rate of house price inflation. That being said, the current imbalance in the housing market has the potential to impact on competitiveness and labour supply and thereby adversely affect our economic performance in the future.   <\/p>  <p>  To mitigate against these risks, the Government has put in place a suite a measures, including the recently published Housing for All strategy. The Strategy sets out an ambitious programme of housing delivery to meet the needs of our growing economy and population over the medium-term through both private and public investment. While cognisant of potential capacity issues in the sector, Housing for All also represents the most ambitious investment in social and affordable housing in the history of the State. The Strategy aims to increase housing supply by as much as 300,000 units by 2030 and an average of 33,000 units per annum.

Indeed, housing completions are also turning a corner, in spite of the challenges of the pandemic, with most economic observers now revising upwards their predictions for completions for 2022 and beyond.

These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect:   <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience; <\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);  <\/p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income: growing cost inefficiencies have been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years; <\/p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that non-bank lenders are now playing a greater role in the provision of new mortgage credit and are offering long term fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remain term. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[54726\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will indicate the ongoing effect of Brexit on the economic performance in Ireland as well as other EU Member States; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>My Department has been to the fore in producing a number of assessments on the economic impact of Brexit. Joint analyses by my Department and the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI) modelling the macroeconomic impact of Brexit were published in 2016 and 2019. The analyses covered a range of outcomes and possible future relationships between the EU and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  The analyses included a limited Free Trade Agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas on the goods side with very little covered in respect of services. Overall this is broadly in line with the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Under this Free Trade Agreement scenario, the research found that the level of GDP would be around 2  per cent lower over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) and around 3 per cent lower over the long-term (i.e. 10 years), compared to a situation where the UK remained in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the COVID-19 pandemic additional analysis was also jointly undertaken with the ESRI in 2020. The research found that the long term impacts of Brexit were broadly in line with analyses undertaken prior to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The TCA arrangements were introduced on 1 January 2021 across the EU for imports from the UK. In contrast, the UK has chosen to implement the new procedures on its imports from the EU on a phased basis with full customs checks planned to be introduced from the first quarter of 2022. Given this phased introduction, the full economic impact of Brexit will not be evident for some time<\/p>  <p>  The data so far this year show that Irish goods imports from the UK have declined by almost 20 per cent in annual terms.

The stark divergence between exports to, and imports from the UK, suggest that the diverging non-tarriff barriers have had an immediate impact on bilateral trade. <\/p>  <p>  Notably, most other EU countries also recorded a decline in imports from the UK in the first half of this year, with the share of imports from the UK well below the pre-Brexit share in most EU member states.

Pillar One of the agreement will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer, while Pillar Two will see the adoption of a new global minimum effective tax rate of 15% applying to multinationals with global revenues in excess of &euro;750m. The agreement on Pillar Two allows for the retention of our domestic 12.5% corporation tax rate for the 99% of the companies in Ireland that are out of scope of the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Joining this agreement is an important decision for the next stage of Ireland&rsquo;s industrial policy - a decision that will ensure that Ireland is part of the solution in respect to the future international tax framework.

If Ireland is not to apply the global minimum effective tax rate it means that another jurisdiction will collect those taxes. So, not joining an agreement will result not just in reputational risks, but also economic and fiscal risks.<\/p>  <p>  This has been a difficult and complex decision but I believe it is the right one, and I am confident that Ireland will remain competitive into the future, and we will continue to be an attractive location when multi-nationals look to investment locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[54728\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will indicate the future fiscal measures, if any, required throughout the Eurozone in the context of Covid-19 recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>The exceptional economic circumstances of the past eighteen months have seen a strong consensus on fiscal policy across the EU.

The legislative framework that applies to investment funds includes European and domestic legislation along with Central Bank regulations and guidance. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank, as the independent financial regulator, is committed to effective supervision in keeping with its mandate to safeguard financial stability, protect investors as well as protecting market integrity. In carrying out this mandate in respect of investment funds, I am advised by the Central Bank of the following:  <\/p>  <p>  At the authorisation stage of an investment fund, the Central Bank assesses a number of areas when considering whether the asset composition of a proposed fund is appropriate. Since 2019, all funds seeking to undertake atypical strategies, must make a pre-submission to the Central Bank and receive pre-clearance. In terms of ongoing supervision of the activities of funds in relation to their authorisation, the Central Bank is rigorous in its assessment of risks having regard to the evolving market and risk landscape, ensuring that funds can clearly demonstrate their compliance with their legislative and regulatory obligations is integral to this process.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is constantly seeking to evolve and improve its approach to assessing applications. These processes are targeted at mitigating the prevailing key risks for investors and maintaining the integrity of the market. Using this risk-based approach means that the Central Bank is equally focused on the risks that new funds may introduce into the financial system, as well as the quality of disclosure in fund documentation and continuing compliance with regulatory obligations. The Central Bank&rsquo;s approach is also informed by the evolving regulatory environment for investment funds, particularly at a European level with respect to: the Central Bank&rsquo;s risk outlook, work underway at the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the regulatory practices in place in other EU and international jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  There are two main categories of funds authorised by the Central Bank, UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). In both cases, the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to revoke or withdraw a fund&rsquo;s authorisation if certain breaches occur. <\/p>  <p>  UCITS are investment funds regulated at EU level, designed with the retail consumer in mind. The Central Bank may revoke the authorisation of a UCITS if it appears to the Central Bank that any of the requirements for the authorisation of the UCITS are no longer satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) are any funds that are not UCITS. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), is not a product based regulation, but is instead focused on the supervision of the asset manager. Under the AIF Regulations, the Central Bank may withdraw the authorisation granted to an AIFM where the AIFM breaches certain conditions, including the contravention of any of the regulations. Additionally, an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) must notify the Central Bank before implementation of any proposed changes that would materially affect the basis on which the authorisation had been granted to it, or on which the Central Bank has attached any conditions to the authorisation. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am advised by the Central Bank that it is rigorous in its assessment and monitoring of the activities of investment funds, with particular regard to the evolving market and risk landscape, and ensuring that funds can clearly demonstrate their compliance with their legislative and regulatory obligations is integral to this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":577,"content":"<p>Question No. 279 answered with Question No. 130.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":578,"content":"<p>Question No. 280 answered with Question No. 267.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM01800"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[54732\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900069#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects the economy to recover over the next year after the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>Due to the success of our vaccination programme restrictions were eased over the course of the second and third quarters, with the domestic economy recovering strongly as a result.

This investment will be crucial to support  the additional 660,000 jobs projected for 2040. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the impact of Covid-19 and other crises  have demonstrated the vulnerability of society and  the economy to external shocks.  In this context,  national security is a fundamental policy goal for the  Government.  This includes the key components of  defence, foreign policy and justice.  Other policy goals, whether social, economic or environmental, cannot  be achieved without the stability achieved through  effective security and defence policies supported with  appropriate capital resources.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as part of Phase 1 of the review of the National Development Plan, an analysis of alignment with the NDP and NPF was carried out by the National Investment office in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

No. 124\/2014 - Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations 2014 and SI 384\/2015 Public Service Management (Sick Leave) (Amendment) Regulations 2015, lies with each public service sector employer. When considering the process of assessing access to paid sick leave the regulations, as laid out in SI 124\/2014, must be viewed as interconnected rather than individual regulations in isolation.<\/p><p>My department supports this implementation across the public service by providing information and guidance to sectors on policy and regulatory issues that may arise.<\/p><p>Any public servant can approach their employer in relation to their entitlements under the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme including entitlements in relation to pregnancy related sick leave. <\/p><p>The need to protect women during pregnancy and ensure that they are not discriminated against is reflected in the design of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme. These protections are set out in Appendix 1, set out below. <\/p><p>In summary these protections are:<\/p><p>The following extra protections are afforded to a female worker in respect of pregnancy related illnesses which would not apply if she or a male colleague were absent for a non- pregnancy related illness: <\/p><p>(i) An employee who is absent for a pregnancy related illness will receive a minimum of half pay during the pregnancy related illness, regardless of whether she has exhausted her ordinary entitlement to paid sick leave. This means that a female employee will not be taken off pay while on pregnancy related sick leave.<\/p><p>(ii) If a period of sick leave occurs subsequent to the pregnancy, the sick leave pay calculated at the half rate which the employee received during the pregnancy related illness will be discounted for the purpose of calculating entitlement to ordinary sick leave after the pregnancy, subject to the overall sick leave limits.<\/p><p>(iii) The Critical Illness Protocol, which allows for an increase of the upper limits for entitlement to sick leave at full or half pay provides specifically for pregnancy-related illness. Where a pregnancy related illness is serious it will also be covered by the CIP.  One of the criteria for awarding of CIP more generally is 2 consecutive weeks of hospitalisation, however, this requirement is reduced to 2 days for pregnancy related illness.<\/p><p>In these ways, the Public Service Management Sick Leave recognise the distinct position of the pregnant worker and make provision for the protection of the health and welfare of such workers. The Regulations implement the principles of European law in relation to non-discrimination against pregnant workers.<\/p><p><b>Appendix 1<\/b><\/p><p>Sick leave during pregnancy<\/p><p>Relevant regulations:<\/p><p>1.

This is provided for in the Public Service Sick Leave regulations, specifically regulations 19 and 20 (see below).  The employee must be medically certified as unfit for work due to a pregnancy related illness.<\/p><p>Regulation 19 is intended to deal with a situation where an individual is absent because of a pregnancy-related illness and has exhausted the limits for sick leave on half pay. In such a case, Regulation 19 provides that she will have access to an extended period of sick pay at the half rate for the duration of her pregnancy-related illness.<\/p><p>It also provides that the extended period of sick pay at the half rate will not be used in calculating how much sick leave she has taken i.e. it will not be reckoned in calculating her sick leave record. If the employee has a certified pregnancy related illness they can access sick leave in the normal way and will have the same allowance as normal. <\/p><p>If the employee exhausts all their sick leave on full and half pay before going on maternity leave they may get a special extension of paid sick leave at half pay. This extended period of certified pregnancy related sick leave at half pay is not counted on the sick leave record. Therefore, when on certified pregnancy related sick leave a woman will never receive less than half pay.<\/p><p><b>Regulation 20<\/b>provides that a woman who has exhausted her access to paid sick leave due to pregnancy-related sick leave in the previous 4 years may have access to additional non-pregnancy-related sick leave at the half rate of pay.  However the number of additional days allowed is limited under the following conditions: <\/p><p>- They will be the equivalent number of days taken on pregnancy-related sick leave in the 4 years; <\/p><p>- They must not exceed normal sick leave limits (i.e. 183 days\/365 for CIP) for non-pregnancy-related sick leave (when counted with other non-pregnancy-related sick leave in the previous 4 years). <\/p><p><b>Sick leave post maternity leave<\/b><\/p><p>After maternity leave, if an individual has gone over normal paid sick leave\/CIP thresholds there is access, at half pay, to the equivalent number of days taken on pregnancy related sick leave subject to the four year sick leave threshold.<\/p><p>This does not include the &ldquo;extended&rdquo; period of certified pregnancy related sick leave at half pay as this is not counted on your sick leave record.<\/p><p>Once Maternity Leave has ended any further sick leave will not be recorded as pregnancy related sick leave.

In accordance with the terms and conditions of the SCP, due to the value of the grants received by the club in the past, it is necessary to execute a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the public investment in the facility. These requirements were communicated to the club at provisional allocation stage and it was made clear that formal approval could not issue until the legal requirements were finalised. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that my Department&rsquo;s legal advisor, the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO), has been in regular contact with the club&rsquo;s solicitors in relation to some outstanding documentation.

The main focus of the 2020 State Commemorative programme was in Cork City and County given the key centenaries associated with Cork last year and significant additional funding was allocated for these programmes.  Challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in Cork County Council having to postpone many of their programme elements and being unable to draw down commemorative programme funding of &euro;88,000 from the full allocation in 2020.

In effect, this is like retention permission for a development that required an EIA, but proceeded without one.<\/p>  <p>  From when the judgment issued in case C-215\/06 in July 2008, regular engagement took place between Ireland and the European Commission up to the end of 2017, to discuss proposals to ensure that the wind farm development at Derrybrien was brought into compliance with the EIA Directive, as per the second ground of the 2008 judgment, which included proposal for a non-statutory retrospective environmental impact assessment of the wind farm development. However, a mutually agreeable solution was not reached and the Commission informed Ireland by letter on 26 January 2018 that as it considered the second ground of the judgment in C-215\/06 had still not been complied with, further referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) would be required which resulted in case C-261\/18.

Development of the MAP Bill is being led by my Department, working closely with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and his officials, providing input on provisions specific to ORE.<\/p><p>The MAP Bill envisages a system that is designed to work for all types of development &ndash; from the smallest structures to the largest ORE proposal &ndash; and will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential and maximising the potential of our seas with protecting our rich and unique marine environment. The Bill will provide for a completely new governance regime for the entire Maritime Area underpinned by the NMPF.  The main features of the new regime comprise:<\/p><p><b>- Forward planning<\/b>through the National Marine Planning Framework, including comprehensive sub national planning,<\/p><p><b>- Development management<\/b>through a sequenced consenting system that: <\/p><p>- replaces foreshore consents with streamlined Maritime Area Consents (MACs) &ndash; a single state consent to enable the occupation of the maritime area and act as a gateway to the planning system;<\/p><p>- extends the existing planning permission regime into the entire maritime area; and<\/p><p>-  provides for licensing of certain activities. <\/p><p><b>- Robust enforcement provisions<\/b>to ensure the lawful use of the maritime area.<\/p><p>- This new marine planning system will incorporate consenting for the occupation of the maritime area (Maritime Area Consents, or MACs) by a new agency, the <b>Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA)<\/b>, and a new planning consenting regime, to be implemented by coastal local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la. <\/p><p>The enactment of the MAP Bill will provide a modern, up-to-date regulatory framework that will enable ORE developments beyond the limits of the current foreshore regime. It is intended that this important Bill be enacted in this D&aacute;il term. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s increased climate and energy ambition is reflected in the Government target to achieve 5GW of installed offshore wind generation by 2030. There is a further commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a longer-term plan to utilise the potential 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters. The 5GW target will be primarily met through development of ORE in Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coastal regions. This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of conventional fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and existing electricity grid infrastructure to connect these projects to the onshore grid. Subsequent cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast, to take advantage of stronger and more consistent wind speeds, should be increasingly feasible through future advances in floating turbine technology.<\/p><p>Given that the new agency, the MARA, will take time to establish and become operational, a decision has been taken and is reflected under the draft legislation, to enable the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to invite and grant MAC applications from projects satisfying the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo; under the Transition Protocol. It is proposed that the Minister will be enabled to invite applications from those projects during a specified period in advance of the establishment of MARA. The timing for this is dependent on the legislative process. Once established, the MARA will assume responsibility for any MACs granted by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. These projects will be required to apply for all of the requisite consents under the Bill and will be subject to the full assessment procedures by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of the planning permission application.<\/p><p>Work on a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) has also been initiated by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. This will provide an evidence base for the identification of areas most suitable for the sustainable development of wind, wave, and tidal technologies, and will include an assessment of other maritime activities and marine biodiversity. The OREDP, in tandem with a planned economic analysis, will set out the path-way for the development of offshore renewable energy beyond 2030.<\/p><p>The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is currently developing terms and conditions for offshore wind-specific auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). Owing to the specific scale and nature of typical offshore wind farms, dedicated auctions are initially required to support the longer-term potential of this technology in Ireland. A public consultation on the draft terms and conditions for RESS 1 auctions is now underway.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.\u00a0Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM).<\/p>  <p>  Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of\u00a0years, even\u00a0when\u00a0staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in\u00a0other areas of the local authority sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms\/ standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to issues regarding recruitment and retention within the retained fire service; in May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;retained&rsquo; fire services delivery, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association (CCMA).<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues which are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. The Project Team will work with and report to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Fire Service Operations Committee in the performance of its functions.<\/p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and have secured the services of an independent consultant who will survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including central and local government, the public, fire service management\/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. It is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in 2022. At that time the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management will make a determination on the publication of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900072#WRP03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":745,"content":"<p>Question No. 338 answered with Question No. 337.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":746,"content":"<p>Question No. 339 answered with Question No. 337.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architects Register","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900072#WRP03900"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[54512\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900072#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will implement the recommendations in the July 2013 report titled Report on the Title of the Architect; and if he will support the call from an organisation (details supplied) to include a standard grandfather clause in Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007 introduced a system of statutory registration for architects and restricted use of the title of \"architect\" to persons who are registered architects.<\/p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Act makes specific provision for registration based on technical assessment of persons who had been independently performing duties commensurate with those of an architect for a period of 10 or more years in the State prior to the commencement of the Act.

For this reason, the Architects Alliance of Ireland were advised by my Department to discuss their proposal, in the first instance, with the RIAI as registration body and competent authority for the architectural profession in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and all other stakeholders to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements in registration arrangements can be made.

Proof of emergency is required to avail of this service. Passport Service officers working on the emergency service are not qualified to assess the mental health of an enquirer to that service. However, in cases of genuine and documented emergency, every effort is made to assist the applicant. Emergency requests are prioritised through the Oireachtas Urgent Query Service. The Passport Service does not currently track the number of passports issued under the emergency service as they form part of our overall passport numbers. However, in October alone 4,600 emergency queries were handled by the Customer Service Hub.  <\/p><p>The Customer Service Hub is currently staffed by 75 officers. Since June of this year, the Hub has handled almost 125,000 queries by phone and webchat. In October 2021, staff in the Customer Service Hub dealt with 13,000 calls and 15,000 webchat contacts. Due to the large volume of passport queries being directed to the Customer Service Hub, unfortunately it can be challenging to get through on the phone lines or through the webchat facility. My Department continues to recruit and assign additional staff to this service to meet current and expected demand.<\/p><p>With regard to the dedicated passport phone line, as the Deputy will be aware a temporary line has been established to respond to queries on urgent passports cases.  For operational reasons queries on this temporary line are restricted and the number of cases concerned is being kept under active review. <\/p><p>The collection of passports by Oireachtas members cannot be facilitated as this significantly impacts the dispatch of passports for all other customers.<\/p><p>The Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and in Cork are now offering an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports. The Urgent Appointment Service ensures that, for those who unexpectedly require a very urgent turnaround of a passport renewal, there is an option available that is transparent, predictable and clear. It means that an applicant can book and pay for their appointment, safe in the knowledge that they will have their passport within a day, or a few days. To avail of the Urgent Appointment Service for Passport Renewal, applicants must first book an appointment to attend the public office in Dublin or Cork. Applicants can book an appointment through the Department of Foreign Affairs website (www.dfa.ie\/passports). Over 800 urgent appointments have been facilitated since the Passport Service launched this service on 27th September 2021. <\/p><p>The current passport processing times are:<\/p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult renewals<\/p><p>- 15 working days for Complex renewals<\/p><p>- 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p><p>Over half a million passport books and cards have been issued to date in 2021. Almost 45% of passports for simple online adult renewals issue within one business day. 92% of correctly completed applications are processed within the turnaround times. <\/p><p>Deputies should be aware that the processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and apply to passport applications that are fully complete, where all required supporting documentation has been correctly submitted to the Passport Service by the applicant. The projected passport issue date provided to applicants on the online Passport Tracker provides an indication only of the estimated issue date based on current averages and is not an intended guarantee of service. The projected passport issue date by the Passport Tracker provided does not include postage time. Passports are dispatched for delivery by An Post. Once the passport has been dispatched, the Passport Tracker provides the applicant with an An Post reference number to track their passport through the postal system. Passports for delivery in Ireland by An Post are generally received by the applicant within one working day.<\/p><p>Applications can take longer than the average turnaround time if applicants have not provided all of the required documentation to correctly complete their application. There are currently 10,000 postal applications and 95,000 online passport applications on hand at the Passport Service. Of the online applications, 35,000 or 36% of applications, require the applicant to submit the documents needed to complete their passport application. The Passport Service engages with all applicants who have not submitted the required documentation to ensure that their application is completed correctly and can proceed through the processing system. Of the applications that are with the Passport Service for processing, approximately 8% are past the estimated issue-by date. A total of 2,300 completed applications requiring action by the Passport Service were received prior to 4 September 2021. These applications are currently being prioritised by the Passport Service who are working very hard to eliminate these delays.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. These first time applications are complex to process. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship, which they are claiming for the first time. Vetting identity and citizenship is fundamentally important to protecting the integrity of the Irish passport. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must be thoroughly validated. Due to the extra measures involved, processing time for first time online passport applications is 40 working days.<\/p><p>The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants, particularly in light of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Passport Service and the high demand for passports seen in recent months as international travel resumed. In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p><p>Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand remains a priority for my Department and is an issue that is kept under constant review. My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service on an ongoing basis to recruit and assign additional staff to meet the current and forecasted high demand for passports. In addition, the Passport Service is working with relevant divisions within my Department to ensure the health and safety of all staff and is finalising plans in co-operation with the OPW to ensure that additional staff will be accommodated to meet the anticipated increased demand for passports expected in 2022.  <\/p><p>I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply in plenty of time in order to have their passport in hand well in advance of their travel date. In the case of people planning to travel in 2022, whose passports are already out of date or who have children who are first-time applicants, I would encourage them to apply now online.<\/p><p>The Passport Online service continues to be the fastest and most efficient channel for passport applications and is available to first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. <\/p><p>The figures requested by Deputy Collins in Parliamentary Question 54047\/21 are outlined in tabular form below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Data requested<\/th>       <th>1 January 2020 &ndash; 31 October 2021<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total passport applications received<\/td>       <td>985,000 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total online renewal applications received<\/td>       <td>660,000 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total postal renewal applications received<\/td>       <td>66,000 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total online first time child applications<\/td>       <td>65,000 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total postal first time child applications<\/td>       <td>29,000<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900073#WRQ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":821,"content":"<p>Question No. 359 answered with Question No. 358.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":822,"content":"<p>Question No. 360 answered with Question No. 358.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":823,"content":"<p>Question No. 361 answered with Question No. 358.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":824,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900073#WRQ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":825,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[54043\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900073#WRQ04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the military coup that took place in Sudan on 25 October 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[54054\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900073#WRQ04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent military and security forces coup in Sudan; if his attention has been drawn to subsequent reports of many human rights infringements in Sudan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":827,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 369 together.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019 the people of Sudan achieved a path to democratic civilian government following thirty years of military rule. While there has been significant progress since then, the relationship between the military and civilian elements of its government has become increasingly fraught in recent months culminating in a coup on 24-25 October.  This coup saw the detention of civilian members of the government and also civil society leaders.  There are reports of targeted killings and violence against protestors. <\/p>  <p>  These actions have put in jeopardy the hard-won transition.  They are counter to the legitimate wishes of the Sudanese people for freedom, peace, justice and inclusive development. They also have worrying implications for peace and security in the region more broadly. The military takeover of power must be reversed and the democratic transition restored.<\/p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council on 26 October, Ireland unequivocally condemned the military coup, the attacks against protesting civilians and the campaign of unlawful detention against civilian leaders. The Security Council subsequently issued a Press Statement on 28 October, expressing serious concern at the military takeover, and calling for the immediate release of all those detained by the military authorities. We will continue to push for Council oversight as the situation unfolds, including through the three Sudan-focused mandates over which the Council presides: UNITAMS (UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan), UNISFA (Interim Security Force for Abyei) and the Sudan sanctions regime. <\/p>  <p>  High Representative Josep Borrell issued a statement on 26 October on behalf of the EU Member States, including Ireland, warning of serious consequences if the move to dismantle the transitional government was not reversed. Two days later, Ireland participated in a meeting of the EU Political and Security Committee where grave concern at developments was expressed. <\/p>  <p>  At the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 15 November, Minister Coveney will discuss with other EU leaders how a return to democracy in Sudan might encouraged.  <\/p>  <p>  At the Special Session of the Human Rights Council on Sudan on 5 November, Ireland delivered a strong statement commending the courage of the Sudanese people and urging the military authorities to fully respect the rights of peaceful assembly and for a return to the full implementation of the Constitutional Document and the Juba Peace Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed the decision of the African Union (AU) to suspend Sudan from AU activities until &ldquo;the effective restoration of the civilian-led Transitional Authority&rdquo;.  I am encouraged that an emissary to Sudan is to be appointed by the African Commission Chairperson.

Once a person is entered onto the Foreign Births Register, they are an Irish citizen and are entitled to apply for an Irish passport.<\/p>  <p>  In order to protect the integrity of the citizenship process, Foreign Birth Registration applications require very careful analysis in order to validate both the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, such applications undergo rigorous checking by experienced staff at the Passport Service.<\/p>  <p>  Demand for Foreign Birth Registration services reached unprecedented levels following the Brexit referendum in 2016, resulting in a peak of 32,000 online applications received in 2019. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the processing time for Foreign Birth Registration applications stood at 18 months. This processing time is due to the unprecedented peak in applications as a result of Brexit and the aforementioned rigorous validation which citizenship applications undergo. <\/p>  <p>  Operations at the Passport Service were severely disrupted by public health restrictions brought about by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period, it was necessary to pause Foreign Birth Registration processing in order to focus also on the provision of urgent passport services. When Passport services were scaled up in May 2021 to more normal operational levels, in line with the phased easing of restrictions, Foreign Birth Registration staff were redeployed to assist with the delivery of our expanded essential passport services operation. That redeployment has had to remain in place to date due to the continuing strong demand for Passport services. Over 500,000 passports have been issued so far this year.  <\/p>  <p>  The Foreign Birth Registration Service continues to consider urgent requests to expedite an application on a case by case basis, in cases such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Over 5,000 emergency Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed in 2021. Expectant parents and other emergency applicants should make contact with the Passport Service Customer Service Hub to advise of their circumstances, and can do so by telephone or webchat on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.dfa.ie).<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is actively preparing to resume processing Foreign Birth Registration applications as soon as possible and an announcement of the resumption date can be expected shortly. My Department is fully committed to allocating the necessary resources to assist with the high volume of applications, with a focus on reducing turnaround times.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, the Government is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, the Department will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies to the Foreign Birth Registration and passport services. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m for the Passport Service in response to the increasing demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":854,"content":"<p>Question No. 377 answered with Question No. 355.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":855,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR01300"},{"type":"question","counter":856,"qnumday":378,"qnumall":"[54270\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the initiatives being taken at United Nations Security Council level or elsewhere within the European Union to protect human rights and opportunities in Myanmar.","asker":"1549","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":857,"content":"<p>Ireland strongly condemns the coup carried out by the Myanmar military and its attempts to consolidate or legitimise the military regime. The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that has taken years to establish.

Ireland is actively engaging at the European Union and United Nations to call on all sides to refrain from violence, and to fully respect human rights and comply with international law including international humanitarian and human rights law.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the strong and comprehensive approach to the coup set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on February 22.  The European Union has adopted three packages of sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them and pre-existing EU restrictive measures also remain in place. These include an embargo on arms and equipment that can be used for internal repression, an export ban on dual-use goods for use by the military and border guard police, export restrictions on equipment for monitoring communications that could be used for internal repression, and a prohibition on military training and cooperation with the Tatmadaw.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union has allocated &euro;24.5 million in humanitarian aid funding for the most vulnerable for 2021. Ireland has provided almost &euro;2.5 million in finding this year for humanitarian and civil society support in Myanmar. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also proactively engaging in work at the United Nations Security Council. The Council has expressed deep concerns regarding developments in Myanmar, strongly condemned the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained. It is welcome that the Security Council has taken a united position on this crisis, sending a strong message to the Myanmar military. Ireland was also a member of the core group of nations who proposed the June 2021 United Nations General Assembly resolution which called for a stop to the flow of arms to Myanmar. The situation remains on the agenda of the Security Council and we will continue to work with partners in search of a resolution to the deepening crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Military rule opens significant scope for further human rights abuses in Myanmar and Ireland has voiced its concern at four sessions of the Human Rights Council since February 2021. We welcome the unanimous resolutions agreed at these sessions which address human rights issues in Myanmar and call on the Myanmar military to take action to remedy them. We have consistently voiced support for international efforts towards ensuring accountability and justice in Myanmar, including the ongoing processes at the IIMM, the ICJ and the ICC. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our European Union colleagues, has been a steadfast supporter of Myanmar&rsquo;s civilian and democratic transition, its peace process and national reconciliation, and its inclusive socio-economic development. We are currently working with the European Union to consider further actions which will work to restore the democratic path in Myanmar. Through the UN and our Embassy network, we are encouraging those who have influence on the military leadership, including ASEAN and countries within the region, to use it to find a political resolution to this crisis and protect the human rights of the Myanmar people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":858,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR01600"},{"type":"question","counter":859,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[54271\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason for the delay in the processing of a passport application by a person (details supplied) despite the fact that there is an emergency travel case involved and despite the fact that the indicated date of issue was 10 June 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":860,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service issued a Passport Book to the applicant on 3 November and a Passport Card on 4 November. <\/p><p>The process applied to the application in question has been reviewed and while this was a complex application a delay was incurred in verifying the submitted documents and in checking the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to a first time passport.<\/p><p>The Passport Service regrets the inconvenience and stress caused to the applicant in this case. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":861,"content":"<p>Question No. 380 answered with Question No. 357.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":862,"content":"<p>Question No. 381 answered with Question No. 355.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":863,"content":"<p>Question No. 382 answered with Question No. 357.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":864,"content":"<p>Question No. 383 answered with Question No. 355.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haulage Industry","counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR02300"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[54520\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts that are being made to ensure that measures announced by France in retaliation against the UK over the fisheries dispute will not impact the use of the landbridge for hauliers coming to and from Ireland to the mainland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":867,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[54646\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900074#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts that are being made to ensure that the measures announced by France in retaliation against the UK in relation to the fisheries dispute will not impact the use of the landbridge for hauliers coming to and from Ireland to the mainland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":868,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 389 together.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that discussions are continuing between the UK, France and the European Commission  on the question of the implementation of the terms of the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) on the licensing of vessels fishing in traditional waters in the UK. <\/p>  <p>  It is vital that all provisions of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement are properly implemented by the UK, and the TCA is clear on this matter: vessels should continue to have access to waters that they have traditionally fished.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will a psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It is important to note also that under the Special Education Teacher allocation model, a NEPS assessment is not required for students to access learning supports.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the school to which the Deputy refers in this instance the assigned NEPS psychologist is currently on maternity leave. The school, however, continues to have access to NEPS for critical incident support, for regional support and development service and also to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries, through the local NEPS office.

This assessment is informed by my Department&rsquo;s most recent national demographic analysis.  It is my intention to complete this assessment in the current year and to provide an update to the Public Accounts Committee on the outcome of this process.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these schools are already part of the pipeline of projects under the school building programme and their prefab accommodation will be addressed as part of these projects.  Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate accommodation solution. This is relevant for all accommodation projects progressed by the Department.  <\/p>  <p>  There are approximately 1,200 school building projects within the current pipeline across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction - most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025.  The progression and completion of these projects will make further inroads on the replacement of temporary prefabricated accommodation with knock-on savings on the rental budget.  <\/p>  <p>  While it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the last decade or more it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation to meet the accommodation needs of schools. Furthermore, it may also be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation when an immediate or short term need arises. For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned. Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed. The length of time it is necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation will vary from project to project.<\/p>  <p>  I can, however, confirm that my Department is taking an integrated approach to prefab replacement through the replacement of prefabs as part of all large-scale projects. In addition, since mid-2018 all schools approved for additional accommodation under my Department&rsquo;s Additional Accommodation Scheme are having their necessary prefabs replaced as part of their additional accommodation project. This integrated approach helps to streamline the delivery of projects for schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900075#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":930,"content":"<p>Question No. 408 answered with Question No. 407.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[54155\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900075#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department will consider conducting a re-evaluation of all current school extension proposals to ensure that consideration is given to projected intake at schools over the next decade as per recommendations set out in the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts examination of the 2018 and 2019 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 26 &ndash; Education and Skills published February 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":933,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In considering applications, my Department analyses the relevant demographic data in a way that takes account of the significant local and regional variations in demographic trends and enrolment projections across 314 school planning areas (SPAs). <\/p>  <p>  Using school planning area boundaries within my Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information System (GIS) allows data within those boundaries, including data for enrolments in schools, child benefit and other relevant data to be added to the mapping information, grouped and analysed.  <\/p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on both applications under the ASA scheme and for the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.

The approach to antigen setting in education settings, including in schools will be informed by public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is considering recommendations made in relation to the public health response in the schools setting. These include the recommendation that consideration be given to how recently published European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidance &ldquo;Contact tracing in the European Union: public health management of persons, including healthcare workers, who had contact with COVID-19 cases &ndash; fourth update&rdquo; should be integrated into  existing public health response in the schools setting. The Department of Education will continue to engage and assist with any public health-led initiative in the schools sector in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s ventilation guidance for schools is very clear and practical on the steps to be taken by all schools to manage ventilation levels. Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. <\/p>  <p>  The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas\/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. Over 35,000 CO2 monitors at a cost of circa &euro;4million have been distributed to schools across the county. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. <\/p>  <p>  A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation and are available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department. Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Where the above measures have been undertaken, and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room\/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900075#WRS05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[54281\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900075#WRS06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if parents will be notified when there is a positive Covid-19 case in their child&rsquo;s classroom; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":970,"content":"<p>The approach to supporting schools to operate safely during Covid-19 has been to follow and implement public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Public Health do not recommend that schools tell parents of other children that there has been a case of Covid-19 within a class or group within a school where follow up testing it not recommended.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.   The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs. The policy advice was considered by the Department and it was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  <\/p>  <p>  This programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the participating SNA.<\/p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  <\/p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over a 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900076#WRT01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900076#WRT02000"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[54451\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900076#WRT02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the one release day per week for teaching principals will only extend to the end of the current school year as it appears to suggest in Circular 50\/2021; if so, the reason; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>I am keenly aware of the huge contribution made by all Principals in our schools, including teaching principals.<\/p>  <p>  The  COVID-19 supports provided under The Roadmap for the Full Return to School in 2020, included specific funding to support Principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.

Unfortunately one circular was issued indicating that the increase applied to certain staff beyond public servants (including grant-funded staff such as school secretaries, caretakers and cleaners). This was an error as the increase does not apply beyond public servants and when this error came to the attention of the Department the relevant circular was withdrawn.

Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 007\/2019 and 008\/2019, stated that the allocations being made for 2019 would initially remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. <\/p><p>The NCSE Policy advice &lsquo;A Proposed new Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014)&rsquo; on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place initially for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;<\/p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021\/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.<\/p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.<\/p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. <\/p><p>Maintaining the existing allocations of Special Education Teachers for the 2021\/22 school year means that schools will not have to engage in an extensive redeployment of posts, or re-clustering, this year.<\/p><p>It also means that schools will have greater levels of certainty as to the staff that they will have in place for September.<\/p><p>No school will see a cut, or reduction, to their special education teaching support in 2021\/22.<\/p><p>Where schools have growing enrolments year on year, they will receive an increased allocation, pending the next re-profiling. <\/p><p>Even in circumstances where some schools were anticipating a greater level of increase year on year, if full re profiling had occurred next year, the increased allocations for developing status combined with the existing allocation of the school will show an increased overall teacher allocation for these schools in 2021\/22.<\/p><p>The allocations for 2021\/22 which are being maintained comprise the allocations which were made for schools from September 2019 plus any additionality achieved since plus any developing hours for the 2019\/20 and 2020\/21 school years.<\/p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: <i>www.ncse.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Primary-Schools-Review-Application-2020.doc<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900076#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":1009,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[54475\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900076#WRT03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the plans that are in place to appoint a sufficient number of SNAs to a school (details supplied); when this situation will be resolved; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1010,"content":"<p>The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews.<\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.

If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed to avail of the interim Total Contributions Approach, including HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.

Intreo also delivers a recruitment and job matching service for employers.<\/p><p>Jobseekers work with a LES Mediator to develop a personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.<\/p><p>To address the additional challenges some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, the Department contracts with 24 companies for the delivery of EmployAbility services in 31 locations.<\/p><p>Access to these service providers is through referral: a jobseeker, with a disability, who is working with their Intreo Case Officer or LES Mediator may be referred to an EmployAbility service provider if it is agreed between the two that the jobseeker would benefit from the type of services and support provided.  Providers deliver a supported employment model of services for jobseekers with disabilities.  Jobseekers work with a job coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.<\/p><p>The Department also provides specific support for graduate jobseekers with disabilities through AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability), a contracted service provider.  This provider delivers the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; Programmes on behalf of the Department.  These programmes provide paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter or re-enter employment.<\/p><p><b>The Rural Social Scheme<\/b><\/p><p>The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) is an income support scheme providing part-time employment opportunities for farmers and fishermen or women who are in receipt of certain means-tested social welfare payments, and who are underemployed in their primary occupation. <\/p><p>To be eligible to participate in RSS, a person must be aged 25 or over, must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment (e.g. Disability Allowance), must satisfy the means test for receipt of Farm\/Fish Assist, and meet the criteria of being a self-employed farmer or a fisherman\/fisherwoman. <\/p><p>The scheme offers participants the opportunity to gain valuable work experience in their communities, and participants are contracted to work 19 and a half hours, and are paid the equivalent of their existing social welfare payment, plus an increase of &euro;22.50 per week, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;225.50 per week.<\/p><p>The RSS is delivered by a network of 36 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, collectively known as implementing bodies (IBs).

However, CE participants, working towards a major educational award, can seek to extend participation by up to two years.<\/p><p>CE placements are intended to be temporary.  This is to ensure the continued availability of places on CE schemes for a broad range of long-term unemployed candidates.  Those who are unemployed and in receipt of an eligible payment for 12 months or more may be eligible to participate on CE. <\/p><p><b>Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)<\/b><\/p><p>WSS has been designed for private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives for such employers.  There are three Strands of the WSS that an employer can avail of:  <\/p><p>- Strand I is a general subsidy to compensate an employer if there is a productivity shortfall resulting from the person having a disability.  An employee must work for a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 subsidised hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour.  <\/p><p>- Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand I payment, to cover any additional work-based costs relating to these employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage payment based on the number of employees (strand I) employed.  <\/p><p>- Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more employees (Stand I) with a disability to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.<\/p><p><b>Reasonable Accommodation Fund Grants<\/b><\/p><p>Intreo's Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants assist both jobseekers\/employees with disabilities and employers seeking to support a new recruit with a disability or an existing employee who has or acquires a disability.

Section 59 of the Act provides for similar arrangements through a grant or contribution in kind to non-profit organisations for services supplemental to those provided by the Agency. Such services are commissioned under a formal Service Level Agreement and assist Tusla to fulfil its statutory responsibilities and deliver on the Agency's strategic objectives. <\/p>  <p>  Each organisation funded under these arrangements operate independently of Tusla. Each is responsible for the recruitment of employees, including Social Care Workers, and the terms and conditions under which individuals are employed. Section 56(14) of the Act of 2013 stipulates that &lsquo;an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the establishment of Tusla in 2014 some of the organisations now funded under section 56 were funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004. In October 2018 the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) reached agreement between the Department of Health and HSE and trade unions representing staff in certain section 39 organisations. Pay restoration in relation to organisations funded through section 39 was applied to organisations who met certain specific criteria. The criteria related to the organisations rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. The criteria included only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process. Pay restoration was limited and solely applicable to those organisations included in the initial WRC agreement. This process has reached a final resolution and there is no scope to revisit eligibility criteria.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to working with colleagues in Government, Tusla and other service delivery partners to address the sustainability of voluntary organisations and ensure that we meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Ireland.

The aim of the student grant scheme is to make a contribution to the cost of going to college.  <\/p>  <p>  The student grant is an absolutely critical support for the students who receive it. That is why, following taking up my Ministerial appointment, I initiated a Review of the Student Grant Scheme to see where improvements would be most effective. The importance of this Review has been underlined by the rise in the costs of living across society. This has impacted students who have been affected by the increasing costs of accommodation and a range of other costs.<\/p>  <p>  The review is at an advanced stage, and is in the process of finalisation by the consultations and the steering group.  There was significant public interest in the Review, with around 280 submissions and over 9,000 survey responses from students.  The final Report will be presented to me later this year and I intend bringing it to Government for approval.  It is the intention that this review will inform policy priorities and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy.  <\/p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for student grants are reviewed annually by the Department and approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. All proposals made in relation to education expenditure, including student grants, are considered in the context of the annual Budget.  <\/p>  <p>  For the current academic year of 2021\/22, student grant applications are assessed with reference to the Student Grant Scheme 2021, with the means test based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I have secured an additional &euro;15m to enhance the existing financial supports under the Student Grant Scheme for implementation in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022\/23 this will mean:-<\/p>  <p>  - An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant. There are currently circa 62,000 SUSI grant recipients receiving maintenance support. <\/p>  <p>  - The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant has been increased by &euro;1,000. <\/p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022\/23 academic year.<\/p>  <p>I have prioritised these changes for the 2022\/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students building on the improvements that have already been made for postgraduate students through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme.

These schemes provide avenues for Afghan nationals to seek protection and for eligible family members living in Ireland to seek to have their close family members granted permission to reside in Ireland, where the relevant criteria are met. More than 740 Afghan nationals have already been granted permissions to reside in the State so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also approved an additional initiative: the special Afghan Admission Programme, which will provide places for up to 500 Afghan family members.

The legislation sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent(s).<\/p>  <p>  In addition, under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child. The Bill will also provide for the establishment of a National Surrogacy Register to ensure the child&rsquo;s right to identify all parties (including the surrogate mother, intending parents and any donor) involved in the child&rsquo;s conception and birth. Commercial surrogacy in Ireland will be prohibited as it raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.<\/p>  <p>  Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;.

NIAC in conjunction with the RCPI and the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology have prepared a guide to aid vaccinators and other healthcare workers on how to advise allergic individuals in respect of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this guide is available here: rcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/FAQs-about-COVID19-Vaccines-and-Allergies_12August2021.pdf <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900084#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900084#WRBB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1476,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[54243\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900084#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the options that are available to persons to receive a booster vaccine in circumstances in which a person received a vaccine (details supplied) and is medically unable to receive another one; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1477,"content":"<p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  The OPAP provides for a mid-term review to be carried out, which will lead to a refreshed and updated Plan with a revised set of actions for the remaining lifetime of the OPAP.

A strong evidence base will be required for any new legislative measures, and the review of the OPAP will build on the work already underway to identify gaps in the implementation of the Plan, including where actions need to be progressed, whether by legislative or other means, and where further research is required.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the multi-faceted nature of the obesity crisis, a high level of interdepartmental collaboration will be required to implement measures aimed at tackling obesity and in the preparation and implementation of legislation, as well as extensive stakeholder consultation.

The EMA subsequently advised an extension of indication for the Moderna vaccine to include use in children aged 12-17 years. The NIAC reviewed these findings and has recommended that vaccination be extended to those aged 12 -15 years, those in this age group will be offered an mRNA vaccination to protect themselves from COVID-19. There are currently no vaccines authorised for use for those aged under 12 years old.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in children under 12 years of age are currently ongoing, with results expected later this year. Vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna are conducting trials in healthy children between the ages of 6 months and 11 years old using lower vaccine doses. Children have different reactions to medications and vaccinations, so conducting clinical trials specific to that population is important to fully understand the benefits and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in this group. Once the data becomes available, it will be thoroughly reviewed by the EMA and the NIAC prior to the vaccines being administered to children under age 12.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900086#WRDD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":1644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900086#WRDD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1645,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[54576\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900086#WRDD04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of capital project applications which have been submitted by each hospital, by hospital group, for new bed units and wards and treatment capacity expansion, for example, theatres;

The CFP provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future reflects this approach by committing to protect marine biodiversity and to secure a sustainable future for the fisheries sector while supporting coastal communities. In the Programme, the Government has committed to supporting the inshore fisheries sector in specific ways, including ensuring 'that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and recreational fishers and that pair trawling will be prohibited inside the six-mile limit. I am fully supportive of this objective.<\/p>  <p>  The National Inshore Fisheries Forum is currently in the process of implementing the first industry-led Strategy for the Irish inshore fisheries sector, with support from BIM, my Department and other agencies. The Strategy, which was launched in 2019, was developed through an extensive consultation process that engaged members of the inshore sector as well as other stakeholders. The priorities identified in the Strategy include the development of a profile of the inshore sector, building the sector&rsquo;s capacity to engage with policy development and enhancing the industry&rsquo;s understanding of management and planning for inshore fisheries. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy also facilitates the investigation of new diversification opportunities for the inshore fisheries sector where supported by solid evidence. While the inshore sector does focus on fishing for non-quota shellfish species, such as brown crab, lobster, cockle and razor clam, it should be noted that there are inshore fishers who fish for quota stocks as well, including demersal and pelagic stocks. For pelagic stocks such as mackerel, herring and horse mackerel, a number of fishing opportunities have been made available particularly for inshore fishing vessels.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to funding, financial supports are available to the inshore fisheries sector under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme (EMFF) which my Department runs. The EMFF Sustainable Fisheries Scheme makes available grants to inshore fishers for investment on board to improve energy efficiency, selective fishing gear, health and safety and hygiene, product quality and to add value to catch. Grant rates of up to 70% are available for small scale coastal fisheries (SSCF) vessels. As the EMFF Programme is ending, the Sustainable Fisheries Scheme has recently closed to allow BIM time to assess what funds remain available for the scheme and it may briefly re-open again shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the EMFF Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme offers grants to inshore fishers for capital investment onshore for facilities such as storage and refrigeration. This scheme provides grants of up to 80% for SSCF vessels.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is presently preparing a new Seafood Development Programme for the 2021-27 period under the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. It is anticipated that this new Programme should be in place during the first half of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I have met with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum and heard directly the concerns and goals of the inshore fisheries sector. I will be meeting with the Forum again shortly, along with representatives from the marine agencies. I look forward to discussing with the Forum members how we can continue working together to support the inshore community and the wider seafood sector in achieving its potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900089#WRGG04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1837,"content":"<p>Question No. 717 answered with Question No. 707.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1839,"qnumday":718,"qnumall":"[54464\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900089#WRGG05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will release the proposed terms for acceptance into the temporary and permanent tie-up and cessation schemes suggested in the recently published report of the Seafood Sector Task Force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1463","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1840,"content":"<p>I established a Seafood Sector Task Force in March 2021 to examine the impacts on our fishing sector and coastal communities of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and to make recommendations to me on initiatives that could be taken to provide supports for development and restructuring so as to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing fleet and to identify opportunities for jobs and economic activity in coastal communities dependent on fishing.<\/p><p>I received the report of the Task Force on 11th October and it makes recommendations for a broad range of support schemes to assist the seafood sector and coastal communities to mitigate the impacts of the TCA, including temporary and permanent cessation schemes for the fishing sector, liquidity support schemes, capital investment schemes, marketing supports, marine infrastructure renewal and enhanced community led local development through the seven Fisheries Local Action Groups.<\/p><p>In relation to temporary fleet tie-up, the earlier Interim Report of the Task Force had recommended that such a scheme be implemented in 2021 as an interim measure to support the income of the whitefish fleet pending more permanent fleet restructuring measures such as decommissioning.

It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework.  <\/p><p>This will include consideration of a single consent system for licensing.<\/p><p>In addition, an independent Systems Analyst is conducting an end-to-end process review with a view to licensing process improvement and an interim report on this work has recently been submitted to the Project Board.<\/p><p>There has also been significant work carried out on all other aspects of Project Woodland to and some of these, along with the process and regulatory review, will inform the setting of definitive timelines for the delivery of forestry licences. These include:  <\/p><p>- A pilot project for pre-application discussions. <\/p><p>- Payment of an Environmental Planning Grant. <\/p><p>- A new Customer Charter for forestry. <\/p><p>- A Communication Plan that assists in conveying the multi-functional benefits of forestry. <\/p><p>- A review of the organisational structure of forestry within my Department. <\/p><p>- Commission of a Training Needs analysis. <\/p><p>- Definition of the backlog and associated dashboards. <\/p><p>- Actions relating to reduction of the backlog.<\/p><p>Alongside Project Woodland, my Department continues to address the licensing issue,  and we have invested significant resources in order to deal with the backlog, which I know is impacting the sector.  We now have 27 ecologists, and additional forestry inspectors and administrative staff have been put in place.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, improved processes have been introduced to allow ecologists focus on the ecological aspects of files referred to them.  This has had a positive effect on licence delivery and in the last 8 weeks we have issued on average 117 licences per week. I am hopeful that we will meet our target of 4,000 licences this year as compared to 2,593 last year. <\/p><p>While we still have a way to go, we are moving in the right direction.<\/p><p>Regarding the establishment of a forestry development agency, I would like to advise the Deputy the COFORD Council is a body appointed by the Minister of State for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to advise me and my Department on issues related to the development of the forest sector in Ireland.  <\/p><p>The membership comprises stakeholders from across the forest sector, including government departments, its agencies, NGOs and the private sector.  <\/p><p>Under Project Woodland it is planned to review the roles of COFORD, Teagasc and Coillte.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to recognise the momentum and progress made under Project Woodland and I acknowledge the hard work and commitment shown by all involved, in particular the representatives from the Forestry Policy Group. <\/p><p>I would also like to reiterate my commitment and that of Minister Hackett to ensuring that Project Woodland is fully implemented for the benefit of landowners, forest owners, producers, and all those working in the forestry sector, as well as society as a whole. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1867,"content":"<p>Question No. 727 answered with Question No. 726.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1868,"content":"<p>Question No. 728 answered with Question No. 726.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1869,"content":"<p>Question No. 729 answered with Question No. 726.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":1871,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1870,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1871,"qnumday":730,"qnumall":"[54087\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH02400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the current status of the Bill aimed at indemnifying farmers against liability for walkers on their property; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1872,"qnumday":731,"qnumall":"[54088\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH02500","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the current status of the Bill aimed at indemnifying farmers against liability for walkers on their property; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1873,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 730 and 731 together.<\/p><p>My Department has, for some time, been examining how best to introduce a scheme to indemnify private land owners in upland areas who allow access to their lands for recreational purposes.

This platform will offer a suite of booking, hub management and e-commerce applications to members of the Network. The Network will also facilitate the sharing of innovation, experience and best practices across the community. These supports will serve to maximise benefit to member hubs, hub clients, employers, local communities and the wider economy. <\/p><p>The National Hub Network Working Group led by my Department has so far identified and mapped over 450 remote working hubs across the country. The attached file, which is also available as a map on connectedhubs.ie, includes details of verified hubs by county; all of which will be invited to join the Connected Hubs Network to create shared infrastructure that will deliver real benefits across the country. To date, approximately 150 hubs have joined the Connected Hubs Network, with this number rising on an ongoing basis. <\/p><p>My Department operates a number of funding schemes that focus on projects supporting remote working through the development of hubs, including the development of BCPs as long-term, digitally-enabled community assets.  <\/p><p>The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme both support the establishment of new digital hubs. To date, RRDF funding of &euro;67 million has been approved for 44 projects that will develop or deliver Hubs that will provide remote working facilities in rural towns and villages and their outlying areas. <\/p><p>Support for new remote working hubs is also one of the areas being prioritised under my Department's 2021 Town and Village Renewal Scheme. The focus is on establishing new remote working facilities in town and village centres where properties are currently vacant or where existing community\/ publicly owned buildings can be repurposed. This call closed to applications on 16 July 2021 and the assessment process is currently underway, with successful projects set to be announced by the end of the year.<\/p><p>In July this year, through the Connected Hubs funding stream, I awarded close to &euro;9 million in funding to over 100 successful applicants.  This funding  will allow for the expansion of existing hub facilities and remote working infrastructure in digital hubs, including Broadband Connection Points, throughout the country. <\/p><p>The development of a national hubs network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the development of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery. I am happy to confirm that I have secured additional funding as part of Budget 2022 across the range of services provided by my Department, including for the further support of remote working hubs. Details of calls for applications to relevant funding streams will be announced by my Department in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan","counter":1878,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1879,"qnumday":733,"qnumall":"[54105\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110900090#WRHH03200","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the amount as a percentage and in euro of the National Development Plan which was allocated to development outside of Dublin; and the amount as a percentage and in euro of Budget 2022 which was allocated to projects, schemes and developments outside of Dublin.","asker":"1504","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1880,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that last month the renewed National Development Plan 2021 &ndash; 2030 was launched.
