Like a number of members of the committee, I have just returned from COP26 in Glasgow.  We have all been witness to the powerful testimony of many international leaders from climate-vulnerable nations, who have painted a stark picture of the impact that climate change is already having on their nations and communities.<\/p> <p>  The science is clear and definitive on the need for urgent action.  The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report, Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis, establishes incontrovertibly that the negative effects of climate change are already being experienced globally and they will continue to increase exponentially, in magnitude and volatility, along with global temperatures.<\/p> <p>  We have made some progress towards this goal in Glasgow.  Ireland had a significant presence and extensive engagement at COP26 on a number of key areas which will feed into global decarbonisation efforts.  The Glasgow Climate Pact, which is the overarching agreement, keeps alive the ambition of restricting global temperature rise to 1.5&deg;C.  It struck a balance between increasing climate ambition, delivering on calls for increased climate finance and adaptation supports and provides the way for a new dialogue on the issue of loss and damage, which is critical to supporting climate justice for those most exposed to climate change.<\/p> <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 establishes our climate objectives in law and will underpin national climate action in the medium term and long term.  Further to the enactment of the Climate Act on 25 October 2021, the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, submitted the first carbon budget programme under the Act, which consists of three consecutive carbon budgets bringing us up to 2035.  The first two carbon budgets in the programme provide for the 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the State by 2030, relative to 2018, as set out in the Climate Act.  The third carbon budget is provisional and consistent with the 2050 national climate objective.  I have written to both the Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach today to cause a copy of this proposed carbon budget programme to be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will be followed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann considering whether to refer the carbon budget programme to this committee.<\/p><p>Should this be the case, the committee will be tasked with considering the carbon budget programme and providing a report to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Should the committee so wish I would be happy to attend before it to assist in any such deliberations.  In parallel, and in accordance with the climate Act I intend to consult with the public and with Ministers as part of considering the carbon budgets before taking a proposed carbon budget programme to Government.  When the Government has approved the carbon budgets, a copy of them will be placed again before both Houses of the Oireachtas for consideration.  At this point, if the carbon budget programme was referred to the committee, both Houses would be informed by the joint committee&rsquo;s report on the carbon budgets.  Furthermore, a motion will be considered on the Government&rsquo;s proposed carbon budgets taking effect.  Once these overall, economy-wide carbon budgets are adopted, the Government will divide the overall carbon budgets into sectoral emissions ceilings.  Sectoral emissions ceilings will establish how each sector must contribute towards meeting this target, through further established sectoral decarbonisation targets.<\/p><p> It is crucial that while we prepare our carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, delivery of climate action in Ireland continues at pace.  The climate action plan, which the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and I launched on 4 November, provides a detailed roadmap for meeting our climate ambition under the climate Act.  The plan sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy.  These ranges will be finalised in Climate Action Plan 2022 following the legal adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.  The Government will support the changes through major public investment announced recently in the &euro;165 billion national development plan, including increased funding for retrofitting of homes, building new public transport infrastructure, reskilling workers and supporting a just transition.  While the climate action plan builds on the ambitious targets of the 2019 plan, it represents a significant step-up in terms of ambition and implementation.<\/p><p> I wish to highlight a number of the most significant measures included in the plan, which are as follows: an increase in the proportion of renewable electricity to up to 80% by 2030, including an increased target of up to 5 GW of offshore wind energy; and a significant reduction in transport emissions by 2030.  Measures will include enabling 500,000 extra walking, cycling and public transport journeys per day by 2030, and supporting the take-up of electric vehicles to reach almost 1 million vehicles by 2030.  It also includes the implementation of a new national retrofit plan to increase supply capacity and make retrofitting more affordable.  It calls on our enterprise sector to see a faster uptake of carbon-neutral heating, increased electrification of high-temperature heating and the phasing out of high global warming potential flourine gases.  It calls for reducing emissions associated with agriculture, which will be central to achieving our climate ambition.  This plan provides a pathway to reduce emissions while supporting world-class food production, through an innovation and science-based approach.  There will be a reduction in chemical nitrogen and more targeted use of fertiliser, while maintaining our position as a leading country in grass growth through multi-species swards.  It will seek a reduction of emissions from land use, and a move to being an overall store of carbon, which will involve further bog rehabilitation, increased afforestation, and the rewetting of peat organic soils.  A new forestry programme will be prepared for launch in 2023. <\/p><p> This plan places a just transition at its core.  It sets out four principles that will guide our policy making and implementation over the coming years to ensure that we can effectively monitor and manage our transition and that our responses remain flexible so that we can respond to future transition challenges and target the areas in need of support.  Each Minister, and the Government as a whole, will be expected to consider these principles as we develop and implement our climate policies.  We have committed in the plan to establishing a just transition commission, which will make periodic recommendations to Government, building on research, engaging through the national dialogue on climate action and through the annual review from the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, on how Government policy can further the just transition.<\/p><p> In delivering this ambitious climate action plan we must ensure we bring people with us and that the transition is fair.  The recently launched national dialogue on climate action will facilitate public engagement and participation, community action, networking and capacity building activities on climate action, giving everyone in society the opportunity to play their part.<\/p><p> Last week, I also announced &euro;60 million in funding from the climate action fund for community climate action projects to support and empower communities to shape and build low carbon, sustainable communities in a coherent way.  The Government will shortly publish an accompanying detailed annex of actions to support the delivery of this plan.  The annex sets out the detailed actions with timelines to drive delivery and enhance our emissions reductions.<\/p><p> The transition to a carbon neutral economy will provide huge opportunities to foster innovation, create new jobs and grow businesses in areas like offshore wind, cutting-edge sustainable agriculture, and low carbon construction.  While we all must act together towards our climate objectives, I realise that the costs of climate action will be more acutely  felt by some than others.  As a Government, we are committed to protecting those most vulnerable and to ensuring a just transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#A00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

There is much we could speak about but I will keep to the agenda item which is the climate action plan.  The plan is so large, but there are two main areas I will concentrate on.  One is offshore renewables, because the target of 5 GW by 2030 is very ambitious to say the least.  It is very welcome and has been mentioned up to this point and before the climate action plan.  What confidence can the Minister give to the industry in regard to that being rolled out by 2030?  The Maritime Area Planning Bill is progressing through the Houses.  The concern is that by the time it takes MARA to start up we are looking at another year, so is there anything that can be done in the interim to speed things up?  We also need to ensure we have marine protected areas in place before allowing development in those areas.<\/p> <p>  I come from the west of Ireland where wind is plentiful.  The first ORESS auction is to take place next year.  Will the west of Ireland see benefits from that?  Much of the development has been concentrated around the east and south.  If we delay things in the west, and do not do both in parallel, then we may see other countries take up the investment that we could very easily benefit from.<\/p> <p>  The second item relates to citizen engagement.  There had been some suggestion that there was not enough engagement on this plan.  I would like hear what the Minister has to say, as there is a large amount in this plan that outlines the kind of engagement we are going to have and it is important that it gets out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#B00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Teams connection has dropped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#B00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I can hear.<\/p> <p>  The development of offshore wind power is critical.<\/p><p>One of the significant developments even since the publication of the plan was the publication by EirGrid last week of its plan, Shaping Our Electricity Future, which is really the how, where and how much of how we meet this really ambitious 80% renewable electricity target.  It was engaged for two years with very extensive public consultation in trying to answer those questions.  It sees offshore wind as critical to developing this renewable, low-carbon electricity system for ten years with many of these projects.  That will present the opportunity for the first phase of development.  There are six on the east coast and one on the west coast.  That is in reply to the question about the west benefitting off the Sceirde Rocks to the west of Connemara.  The six on the east coast run from Dundalk bay down to beneath Arklow.<\/p><p> These will be the first auction and the consent will be issued by my Department rather than the marine area regulatory authority, MARA, because it will take a number of months, or approximately a year, for the authority to be fully established once it is legislated for.  That is why it is really important we get the legislation through the Oireachtas before Christmas, as that would give the industry and all concerned real clarity that this is happening and real.  In the second and third phase of options, which will take place in the coming years, MARA will be responsible for managing consents and ensuring the environmental planning behind the development of offshore wind goes hand in hand.  As members have said, we must ensure the development of marine protected areas and our offshore resources are in tune with each other and we get good spatial planning development of the resource.<\/p><p> This will not be developer-led and the planned system will be based, as much as anything else, on the development of an offshore grid to attract power, bring it ashore and share it with other jurisdictions in a way that makes it a viable economic and balancing low-carbon system.<\/p><p> It is hard to know exactly what will develop where and it will depend on the options system and companies getting through the planning system.  We have an independent planning system that will ultimately assess the environmental credentials and planning approach taken by each individual project.  I expect the majority of the first phase, towards to the middle of this decade, to start being built on the east coast, as six of those first projects will be based on that coast.  These are also very close to where there is a very large demand and Dublin is a large demand centre.  The advantages of being able to connect to the east coast is very real.<\/p><p> Further development this decade will then take place in both the southern and western waters.  As I said earlier, that will be driven very much by EirGrid's plans, as grid access is one of the key aspects we must get right.  Having that grid connection capability to the south and west will see projects in both those areas starting to succeed in the second and third phase auctions.<\/p><p> A huge number of developers are interested.  One recently pulled out, having been initially interested in a particular project, but I am informed up to approximately 70 developers have expressed an interest to be involved in a very real way in looking to tap into this resource.  This is achievable, deliverable and will bring us power in a way that would make efficient use of our grid.  We will not have to build significant grid extensions across the country when we are bringing the power ashore, particularly to areas where there is a large demand load.  That is what will make this a very viable, successful and realisable project.<\/p><p> I am conscious of time and I want to get through as many questions as possible.  There was a very extensive citizens' engagement in a process developing this Climate Action Plan.  It started earlier in the year with a series of climate conversations that my Department organised.  There were approximately 3,800 citizens involved, as well as a large number of institutions.  That consultation informed the plan and it was an appropriate approach of doing the consultation before the perceived solution or outlined plan.  That came first, as was absolutely appropriate.<\/p><p> We now need to do this on an ongoing and more detailed and engaged basis.  I met a group of younger climate activists in Glasgow and they said they wanted to be involved in a very real way.  I said to them and the likes of the National Youth Council that we should do that, ensuring such people can get involved with structuring how the next phase of consultation might take place.  I mentioned in my opening remarks this new community fund and programme, which is largely to fund real community projects.  It also includes funds and the capability to increase input to those sorts of dialogue processes.  Members of the Irish environmental network said to me they thought it was a best-in-class example of public consultation.  We should take projects like that and use them for wider consultation from here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#B00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting across the Minister.

I am having Internet issues as well so if I go, it is the likely cause.<\/p> <p>  On the back of the Conference of Parties, COP, I welcome the Minister signing Ireland to the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, as it is a really important step for the country to take.  There is the question of how that follows through in implementation at home and the move towards effectively banning liquefied natural gas terminals.  We have the statement from the Government on policy but it is really important to send a message we are banning it.  We know the EU has said there is no legal impediment to us doing that.<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to the Climate Action Plan, where chapter 19 deals with international climate policy.  I wonder why Ireland has not made any public statements around the Energy Charter Treaty.  I know there is an ongoing modernisation process at an EU level but other countries, such as France and Spain, have said this is beyond reform.  Members of the public are left on the hook for stranded assets for oil and gas.  Given the EU, in its modernisation process, is looking at excluding the EU and intra-EU disputes from the terms of the treaty, how does it play into our international climate justice obligations if we then allow EU companies to go into the oil and gas-rich global south and have the protections of the Energy Charter Treaty, investor-state dispute settlement and all of that?  I note the EU modernisation process has not removed article 16, which is the supremacy clause, so the Paris Agreement is not at the same standing as the terms of the Energy Charter Treaty in the legal sense.<\/p> <p>  Will we now move to join France and Spain in leaving the Energy Charter Treaty?  With our commitment to the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, will we follow through with the implementation of a full LNG ban?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#C00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>There were 12 countries initially signed up to the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance.  Looking at each of them and where they are in what I call the divestment movement, we are probably the most advanced.  We introduced an end to oil and gas exploration before the Danish Government and many of the other countries on the platform were aiming to do things we are already doing, such as the ban on fracking and having no investment in fossil fuels for the State investment fund.  All of these were agreed on a cross-party basis, which strengthens our joining the movement.<\/p> <p>  We will still use imported gas in the next two decades and those offshore renewables will need backup.<\/p><p>Part of that will be the need for about 2 GW of flexible, open and combined cycle gas plant.  We will use very little gas in them but they are essential to provide cover at those times such as those we saw this summer, early last year or early this year.  We need those as well as to shut off coal plant and old oil plant, so we will use gas for this interim period.  In my mind, LNG imports will not be needed to give us that security.  We can and will be able to use what I see as one of the strategic options, which is using some of the distillate stored that we hold as part of our provisions under the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy to provide back-up fuel for some of those combined cycle gas plants that they can use in the event of an emergency.<\/p><p> We are starting to see the development of alternative hydrogen supplies in the replacement of gas.  This is still some years away but it seems to be becoming an ever-increasing certainty.  Given we have such large offshore wind resources, to be able to convert some of those through electrolysis into hydrogen to provide some of the back-up security seems to make real sense.  I will be looking at the energy security review we commissioned and arrangements we have with the UK and the rest of Europe regarding providing gas security.  We need that security and I believe that will give us the best security.  In the current ongoing energy crisis, it has been shown that LNG does not give us security because the LNG terminals in north west Europe, which were expecting gas to arrive, found overnight that the ships were turning in mid-ocean and heading to Asia, where the price was dramatically higher and, therefore, you could not count on it.  A variety of those arguments will double down and make the case why relying on LNG as a secure system does not work.  I will have to make that case and will do so once we have that energy security review but I expect those sort of strategic issues will be centre points.  <\/p><p> Regarding the energy charter, I understand fully-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#C00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying that he has to make a case at Cabinet to convince his colleagues it does not increase security?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#D00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am not an expert on European law.  I would have to look to see what the provisions are.  The main reason I believe we will not proceed with those terminals is because of the very same energy security reasons I mentioned.  Relying on alternative mechanisms would give us greater security.  While we need significant open cycle and combined cycle gas plants as back up for our energy system, if we are to meet our climate targets, we do not want to see a dramatic increase in the use of gas.  We could not afford to within our carbon budgets.  It is those arguments rather than legal arguments that will be the key mechanism to implement what we were very pleased to see in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the energy charter, once again we get into very complex international legal issues.  My understanding is that the exit mechanism from the energy charter is a 20-year process that is fraught with all sorts of complications and difficulties.  As the Senator noted, there are different views in Europe but a large number of colleagues are saying that we should work with it as a mechanism of reform and a way of using some of the provisions it has to support the low-carbon transition.  Spain was mentioned as a country that wanted to leave.  Spain was brought to court by many of renewable companies because it amended its terms of support for solar power, which was seen by certain players as being deeply unfair, so they used the provisions in that instance to protect the renewable power investment.  It is not black and white in terms of how the provisions of the charter are used.  The key element is how that can be reformed.  It was set up to protect the interests of fossil fuel producers going into and opening up eastern bloc countries and Russia in the early 1990s.  The current environment is completely different.  Coming out of Glasgow, we are going to see a significant switch away from fossil fuel investment towards investment in renewables.  <\/p> <p>  It has never been intimated to me that any of the decisions we made in recent years such as ending oil and gas exploration, stopping fracking or saying \"No\" to immediate planning application on an LNG terminal could not have been made for fear of them being challenged in the investor court dispute resolution mechanism within the energy charter.  I will continue to watch the way international developments evolve.  We will be pushing for it to support the decarbonisation strategy and use it as a tool in that regard.  This is where we should go.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#D00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>While I think we all feel that to say that the outcome of COP26 in terms of global ambition could have been better is an understatement, I genuinely feel Ireland can be proud in terms of the commitment we went there with in terms of the Climate Action Bill, budgets being brought to us by the Climate Change Advisory Council, the climate action plan and sectoral targets.  If other nations had the same commitment, the outcome of COP26 could have been a lot better.<\/p> <p>  Many of the items in the climate action plan regarding how we will reach that 51% target are quite long term and we may not see the benefits for quite a number of years.  I am thinking of offshore wind and light rail in some of our cities that do not have it.  None of those things is going to happen overnight.  For people to really buy into the belief we can achieve these targets, we are going to have to start making gains on those really short-term elements - the low-hanging fruit.  Things like the red tape and bureaucracy schools have to go through to put solar panels on their buildings are things we can change within a short period of time.  Regarding the small-scale generator scheme for farmers, at the moment, farmers can get solar panels installed under the TAMS grant but because it is done under the TAMS grant, they cannot avail of the benefits of micro-generation.  Regarding things like anaerobic digestion, we have models out there where anaerobic digestion is working but we are not putting the proper mechanisms in place to allow co-ops to be set up where anaerobic digesters can be rolled out.  I was delighted to see the Connecting Ireland 25% increase in rural bus routes.  In my own area of west Cork, with which the Minister is very familiar, some of the proposed bus routes will be game changing but we need to see a faster roll out of that.

Michael Mann, that very eminent and brilliant climate scientist and campaigner, spoke at the EPA last night.  One of the things he said was that we should be careful about talking down the international completely.  This is in the interests of the fossil fuel companies.  It is what they do so that people give up and despair.  Yes, the last-minute change in the wording regarding the phasing out of coal was deeply gutting but that was a political cover decision.  Beneath that in the real dense legal text were significant developments such as the signing off on the Paris rule book, agreeing carbon trading arrangements and in particular, commitments to double climate adaptation finance.  In that, we were able to take a very particular active role and could do so because our Taoiseach arrived on the first day and we committed to what was already a very successful adaptation programme we do involving all direct grants - about &euro;100 million per year in climate finance.  We committed to more than double our climate finance support - to a 140% increase over the next five years.<\/p><p>That is an important element.

The metropolitan rail project in Cork is real.  It is starting now and it is fully funded under the European recovery fund.  There will be a twin track from Midleton to Kent Station with new stations and new regular services.  That is being worked on this year, next year and the year after.  That is very real and there are numerous examples like it.  The Deputy is also correct, though, it needs to be brought back home and down local.  I will refer back to the EirGrid study, Shaping our Electricity Futures, published last week.  The company set up its consultation.  Most politicians will understand this.  A key issue to emerge that informed its plan was the need for microgeneration.  For too long, that has been put back, delayed and difficult to deliver, but we are on the cusp of delivering it within months.  It is three phases.  First will be the ability to sell power back to the grid and export unwanted electricity at the wholesale market rate.  The second phase is to allow for some of the funding I mentioned for community energy or on-farm development, school buildings or businesses to be invested in larger microgeneration projects and to get a steady price for that that makes the economics work.  That is central to what is known in our targets as diversification, particularly for farming communities.  Diversification of incomes in farming will be key.  That second phase, coming in months, will be critical.  It will take slightly longer for the third phase, which will be up to 1 MW of power; that is larger projects.  That also has a role in this real distributed, citizens-engaged revolution that needs to be in our energy generation.  That is now agreed policy, going through the final legal checking system, with all the regulations to be ready to go in early January, and it will start in early January. <\/p><p> Anaerobic digestion is very similar.  It has great potential for alternative incomes for Irish farming.  It has to fit into the national land use plan because everything that we do in climate has to be biodiversity-proofed and water pollution-proofed as well.  We do not want to end up with massive volumes of anaerobic digestion and the knock-on consequences of managing water pollution and ammonia pollution that comes with it.  I can envisage a farm where half the grass would go to feed an anaerobic digester and the other half to feed a herd of cattle, the slurry from which would also feed into the anaerobic digester.  It is the sort of example where there would be a smaller number of cattle, leading to a reductions in emissions but a significant increase in income to the farmer.  Now, it is not cheap.  We would have to provide a guaranteed price to make the economics work, but it is an example of the sort of diversification measures in the agriculture industry that we need to do to make everything work.<\/p><p> Finally, the new rural public bus system is critical.  We provided the funding next year to roll out the first phase.  There is a &euro;57 million plan over five years to be comprehensive about how we do this across the country.  However, that is only the start.  We need to start looking at innovative ways in rural and urban Ireland where we have new public transport systems that connect to other State uses and needs, be it the health or education systems, that use technology in innovative ways.  Therefore, this is only the start.  In truth, in the plan the hardest area to change is transport because we have such a stitched-in development model.  We need innovation in our public transport system.  I encourage people to get involved in that consultation on the right moves that are connected to other public transport services such as health and education and to use innovation to deliver for rural public transport users as well as urban.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#D00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  I will speak to the climate action plan.  I agree that it is ambitious and it is positive to hear all the different plans and proposals included in it that the Government intends to roll out.  However, there is an issue around the urgent implementation of these actions.  To date, the Government has consistently found it difficult to meet the target in the 2019 action plan.  Take transport where there is an intention for a 42% to 50% reduction in emissions.  Most of that is based on the move to 1 million electric vehicles, of which 7,000 are being purchased annually.  On public transport, even the Connecting Ireland plan has only &euro;5 million going into that next year.  The Government is seeking a 50% emissions reduction in buildings and key to that is retrofitting.  There is no specific retrofitting apprenticeship now.  Three out of four retrofitting centres of excellence that were promised earlier this year have not materialised.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has failed.  It has only retrofitted 199 of 2,500 social homes that it was supposed to have done this year.  Unfortunately, under each of the specified measures, the Government has failed to meet the targets.  While I welcome the climate action plan, I cannot see how there has been a change in the business-as-usual approach and how that implementation will happen.  The investment needed is not there.  The majority of the &euro;125 billion mentioned is private money.  Individuals will not be in a position to put that money in to meet the implementation of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#E00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Of course, the Deputy is correct.  We have not seen the emissions reductions that were planned.  An advantage is that there has not been a stop-start approach since the 2019 plan.  At the time, I recognised that was the right approach and I commended the Minister on the aims and broad means.  With the new updated plan, we have increased the ambition.  There is a certain advantage in that there is no change in signals to, say, the public service, the business community or householders.  It is a big capital transition and the last thing that is needed is uncertainty.  The cross-party approach to these plans and the consistency as we iterate from one plan to the other is an important part of getting it right.  However, the Deputy is right.  Transport, as I think I said, is the hardest.  Electric vehicles will be only one part of it.  The second major part is the modal shift to active travel and to public transport.  That will require difficult decisions on the allocation of road space and the allocation of the national capital plan at the budget.  That is starting in the national development plan.  More than anything, it is about the political difficulty in making it safe to walk and cycle on our roads and giving the time priority and traffic light priority to buses so that they get through the cities, towns and, indeed, rural Ireland, quicker.  That is down to thousands of individual decisions among councils right across the country.  Critical to this delivery on transport is that the local authority climate action plans marry what we are doing in the national plans.<\/p> <p>  A third area, which is probably getting more complex, is demand reduction.  Since forever, success in transport planning was when more and more transport was being generated.<\/p><p>Now, however, we have an opportunity, particularly with remote working owing to Covid and the 15-minute city or town concept that we are starting to see work well in other cities, to reverse what has been a 50-year pattern of ever-lengthening commutes.  Availing of the opportunity would improve our quality of life and, in the end, our economy.  There would be a stronger local economy.  It is a question of demand reduction.  The most difficult parts are the freight, maritime and aviation aspects.  In this regard, we will require international effort.  If members attended any of the presentations or side events in Glasgow, they, like me, will have heard about Volvo and Scania trucks going green.  I heard about plans to switch to new fuels in the maritime and aviation sectors.<\/p><p> On the building sector, Deputy Whitmore is right about the availability of skills.  We need about 27,000 skilled workers, including craftspeople, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and energy experts.  That is why the action plan connected to the climate action plan, the action plan for apprenticeships up to 2025, involves a five-year strategy to double the number of apprenticeships.  This is probably one of the top priorities of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.  We have to double the overall number of apprenticeship registrations to 10,000.  Critical in this regard was the recent integration of much of the apprenticeship system into the CAO.  Much of the problem is a cultural one in that younger people are getting a variety of signals in from society in different ways indicating careers based on apprenticeships are not high status or high earning.  Nothing could be further from the truth: the careers are the most secure, the most urgently needed and, in many ways, the most rewarding possible.  They involve fixing people's homes and making them much more comfortable to live in.  People in this area are the front-line heroes in the climate crisis.  We need to depict it that way to get our younger people to switch over.<\/p><p> We need to be careful about this year's numbers because Covid killed retrofitting this year.  For the first five months of the year, one could not go into to someone's home.  The budget in local authorities for next year is significant, however, and will allow a rapid scaling up.  Similarly, the national retrofitting plan, which will be launched shortly and will contain a range of measures including one-stop shops, low-cost lending, grants, and financing at a huge scale.  Financing is not going to be the difficulty on the grant side; it will be a question of cultural status and making it easier to do the right thing through really good advice and financial support.  We may surprise ourselves such that when we have year-round contracting without stoppages associated with Covid, it will take off.  We have the key measures in place.  Probably the most important is getting the apprentices trained and working.  While this may have been slow to start because of Covid, it will ramp up now.  I believe we will deliver on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#E00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  On the last point on apprentices and trying to train young people in the areas that we need them, to the best of my knowledge apprentices still pay college fees.  These should really be cancelled.  If the Minister does only one thing, he should have a word with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, about this because there are many young working-class men and women who cannot afford the fees.  The fees are very offputting if one is trying to get into some kind of training.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to be rude to the Minister but I believe an awful lot of what he said here today is in his mind, not in the plan.  That is a problem.  The plan is vague and not specific about so many things.  I want to concentrate on public transport and the national herd.  Only yesterday the Minister welcomed an increase in fares for public transport in Dublin.  That sends a completely wrong message to people.  We want people to move from their cars so we can help to achieve Ireland's carbon-emissions reduction targets.  The last thing we should do, if we are to achieve these, is increase the cost of public transport.<\/p> <p>  In the plan, the Minister has a target of 500,000 sustainable journeys.  Could he tell us &mdash; he need not answer immediately &mdash; how many of these will be by public transport?  Will most of them be by cycling and walking?  The National Transport Authority plan for the greater Dublin area, released last week, estimates an increase of under 4% in the use of public transport by the end of 2042.  That is astounding.  It is so unambitious.  It is kind of frightening to think, in respect of the climate action plan, that these are the low-ambition targets of the National Transport Authority.  Will the Minister comment on the view that the ambition to have 1 million electric cars on the road is out of kilter with the idea of meeting targets in this area?<\/p> <p>  I would like the Minister to say something about the national herd.  There is nothing in the plan that says we need to reduce it.  Last year we increased it by 1.5% to 7.3 million cattle, be they dairy or beef.  The elephant in the room is that we are not prepared to reduce the size of the national herd.  A commitment that has been pointed out time and again involves the global reduction of methane emissions by 30%, yet here at home the reduction will be by only 10%.  The Minister listed a number of ways of achieving the reduction but does not dare touch the herd.  That is pretty shameful.  I would like him to comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#F00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith. The announcement yesterday was to reduce the cost of public transport.  For the first time, it allowed for a 90-minute ticket.  The one ticket allows a passenger to go from the DART to a bus to the Luas and back to a bus, for example.  It was all about increasing usage and reducing the cost.  It is about achieving good connectivity and encouraging people onto public transport.  I believe the new arrangement will encourage them.  This initiative, combined, in particular, with the 50% reduction we will introduce next year for people under 24, is an example of how we need public transport that is affordable in addition to being reliable and frequent.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the exact breakdown for the modelling, but the key point is that it is a matter of switching fuels, shifting modal split and reduction.  Modelling for ten years into the future is an inexact science.  In my mind, I expect we will over-deliver in that regard.  To give my personal view, sometimes in our modelling of what happens when good-quality infrastructure, particularly active travel infrastructure, is provided, we do not quite know how to measure.  I will give an example.  When the cycle route along the Grand Canal, which was of better quality than anything built previously, was introduced, there was an almost immediate 50% jump in cycling journeys on the route.  I will give another example.  When we recently introduced regular bus services around the Dingle peninsula and something similar in Leitrim, using these areas as testers for the new rural public transport system, there was an immediate response, or an almost immediate doubling in passenger numbers.  The Irish public has shown consistently that when high-quality public transport and a safe environment for walking and cycling are provided, they switch.  Who wants to be stuck in traffic?<\/p> <p>  Considering that transport is the hardest aspect to address because of the difficulties with freight and haulage, we may be able to make gains in respect of the shift to active and public transport.  People like it.  They like being able to be online on a bus.  They like the exercise they get and the speed and reliability of cycling and walking.  If we can make this form of transport safe and move away from a system that has been dominated for decades by supporting private vehicle transport, we may be surprised about the upside.<\/p><p> I have a thought on electric vehicles.  Last week I met the New Zealand Minister.  The country is the same size as us with between 5 million and 5.5 million people.  New Zealand has 4.5 million cars.  While we a large car fleet at over 2 million, we are not as bad as some other countries.  I am not sure whether any members were in Glasgow but the city is so road-dominated it would make you weep if you were interested in creating a safe and good local environment.  We are not starting from an impossible base.  The figure of 1 million EVs is just a very ambitious target effectively to switch the fleet.  I think it is possible.  It is possible because they are better cars.  Within two or three years they will be cheaper in the life-cycle assessment and the maintenance cost especially is only a fraction of that of standard vehicles.  I see that coming but do not see it as the be-all and end-all of our decarbonisation of transport.  The shift and the reduction are equally important.<\/p><p> The last point was on the national herd.  This is a narrative that, as I said, both environmentalists and farmers would be better off moving away from as the only narrative people ever talk about when it comes to decarbonisation of agriculture.  We must focus on emissions reductions as a key metric.  We must focus on incomes in Irish farming as a key metric.  I think that is possible.  Going back to what I said earlier, the diversification will come when we pay farmers for rewetting land and restoring peatlands, introducing agroforestry, developing microgeneration and anaerobic digestion and switching to horticulture and to organic farming where you have fewer animals but also less costs because you are not spending so much on incredibly expensive fertiliser.  Again, this is the moment for us to strike because the cost of oil and gas being so high has seen the cost of nitrogen fossil-fuel based fertilisers go through the roof.  They are incredibly expensive now.  This is a moment where we can make that switch.  The key thing is to both reduce emissions and increase income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#F00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The age-old narrative of farmers at war with environmentalists has to stop.  Going back to what I said earlier about the craftspeople working on retrofitting being the frontline heroes, farmers will be the same because they will have to help us adapt to climate change as well as store some of the carbon in our soil.  That is absolutely doable.  We must pay them for it.  I will make a final point on this that I think the Deputy, given her political perspective, will agree on.  The large companies, namely, the large multinational food companies and retailers, are going to have to account for their scope 3 emissions in an evolving climate change accounting world.  They will have to be responsible for their suppliers' emissions.  That gives us an opportunity for them to pay the primary producers, like small Irish family farms, better for the really high quality products they produce.  This is an instance where corporate interests are going to have to acknowledge they have a climate responsibility and help their farmers and their suppliers make this switch.

It is so much easier to get people out of cars in not just big cities but big towns like Dundalk, where I am from.  It is easy to do that, but how do we move that into more rural areas around the country?  How do we do that modal shift?  Is it basically just through trying to get people into electric vehicles and providing better bus routes or are there other multifaceted approaches we need to take to getting the modal shift across the line in rural Ireland?

The first principle is every place matters and every person matters.  This has to be inclusive.  In rural areas, electric vehicles will play a much more significant role for a variety of reasons.  First, they will be cheaper.  If someone is doing long-distance commuting, there will be a significant advantage and benefit in being able to make the switch.  EVs will also be easier to charge.  In certain urban areas, where there might be a terraced row of houses or apartments, there is a difficulty in getting a plug-in home charger whereas houses in rural areas will have less difficulty in that regard.  There will not be a problem with parking on the street, for example.  That will play a significant role.  The critical thing, as I said, is we must have alternatives in rural Ireland as well.  That is why we have the connecting Ireland rural bus service reform.  Further reforms in the school bus system and other rural innovations around providing shared public transport are going to be key.  Furthermore, every single schoolchild and citizen should have a safe environment to allow them to walk or cycle to school.  I know that is not as easy in rural Ireland as there are often roads where speeds are relatively high and footpaths are not as available or as good.  However, we should not abandon rural Ireland and say children there should not have a safe route to school.  That might include a review of speed limits and looking at road networks to create safe routes to schools.  I do not see why we in Ireland should accept that children are not free to be able to cycle to school.  We should be radical in looking at mechanisms to make it safer on our roads.<\/p> <p>  On the SEAI and the national retrofit scheme, it is, as the Senator said, ready to go.  We expect to launch early in the new year.  The SEAI has been given significantly increased resources.  It has got an additional 70 staff, I think, this year and another 50 planned for next year.<\/p><p>Central to making the scheme take off will be the one-stop-shop approach and the new loan facilities.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland will provide a guarantee for the first quarter of a loan for retrofitting.  The work that these loans cover is not cheap, going from &euro;20,000 to &euro;60,000 in some cases.  We have to bring the costs down to make the numbers add up.  One way to do that is to guarantee the first quarter of the loan, which effectively lowers the risk of a default on that loan or on a portfolio of loans.  That allows other banks to come in and lend some of the remaining loans that are needed at a much lower interest rate.  We think that we can almost halve the market interest rates while still involving participants.  There is a figure of &euro;125 million for investment in the climate action plan, the vast majority of which is private investment, which we need.  The scale of change will require the &euro;35 billion in transport investment and &euro;12.9 billion in the national development plan for climate, which is mostly retrofitting-related.  Even with that, we will need further private financing for private houses and commercial businesses.<\/p><p> I met the vice president of the European Central Bank the week before last.

It is inevitable that it is coming.  Not a single country at COP26 said that it did not want to help with the 1.5&deg; C target.  That means halving emissions this decade and reaching net zero by 2050, straight down the middle.  This is incredibly ambitious and has never been done before, but it is the right thing to do economically.  The budgets and the sectoral targets will steer us in that direction.<\/p> <p>  A question for the committee to consider is whether the balance is right between the first half and the second half; I think it is.  There is some flexibility in the 4 million tonnes that we have put in as being unallocated on page 14.  Those will accrue in the second half of the decade, since it is then that land use rules will change to allow us to use some of that.  This is complicated.  My initial and ongoing assessment is that the broad budget approach is correct.  We will have to agree that, then agree the sectoral targets, which will be a challenge.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the scale of ambition for offshore wind, there is no doubt that the UK is ahead of us and most other countries.  It is interesting to see that similar countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark, are probably four or five years ahead of us, but we developed and delivered an onshore renewable system that is world leading.  Our integration of renewable energy is probably the most advanced.  EirGrid manages a large part of our onshore wind energy and it is truly groundbreaking.  We are ahead of the game and other countries with that.  We had to do land-based generation first because offshore generation was expensive.  The price has decreased in the past four or five years.  We can now expect it to be truly economic and to have it at scale.<\/p><p>We needed to do land-based wind first because offshore wind was very expensive.  It has come down in price in the past four to five years.  Now we can expect it to be truly economic and we have it at scale.<\/p><p> I would not limit ourselves to 5 GW of offshore wind.  If we can find that flowing offshore develops quicker than people think - it could well do that - and we find ourselves delivering the first phase and the second phase, I see no reason in the third phase that we should not scale up.  The overall target is for 35 GW of offshore wind.  That is a huge amount.  That is six or seven times our current demand.  There is no shortage of ambition.  There is no restriction on the development, other than environmental ones and also sharing and using it.  There is no point in generating wind if we are just spilling it all the time.<\/p><p> We must build the North-South interconnector.  The committee knows that will come soon.  More critically, we will build the interconnector with the UK - the Greenlink project - by 2023, I understand, coming into Wexford.  It looks as though, going well, the French interconnector will be coming in in 2025 or 2026.  We are engaging in talks with a number of European countries and the UK about further grid interconnection with a view to us being able to balance our system to share some of this very significant power resource we have.  There is no shortage of ambition.  It will scale up as fast as we can do so but we have to get the first steps right.  We need to get the projects on the east coast built, and that will not be easy.  There will be real planning issues.  I am quite certain on that but we will have to approach that and trust in the independence of the planning system to make the calls.  Then, as I said, within this decade, it will be moving into southern waters and western waters.  There is no shortage.<\/p><p> With regard to finance flows, in answer to the third question, the other significant thing coming out of Glasgow is that the financial industry has given a clear signal that it will be switching out of fossil fuels and all financial flows now will be measured for their carbon performance.  There was significant development in the proposed reform of the multilateral development banks - the World Bank and the IMF - and also the use of assets such as special drawing rights which will be significant, particularly for developing countries.  In our own environment, it is more likely to be the issuing of green bonds because that is where we would be able to get the lowest cost finance.  The scale of the investment by EirGrid to fund offshore wind and offshore grid will be very large.  It is an extra &euro;1 billion to meet the 2023 plan, according to their estimate, but there will also be significant investment from the ESB on the distribution grid.  A large part of that will be funded effectively by green bonds because they are regulated assets and because EirGrid and the ESB are seen as professional highly-skilled delivery companies.  That is a significant part of that &euro;165 billion national development plan.  \"Yes\" is the answer.  We will be using green bonds in a variety of different ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#H00600","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#J00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I would mention the European Investment Bank, EIB, also.

The former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, said something similarly where she said, \"You can't negotiate with science.\"  That last-minute change in the wording about shutting down coal was politically gut-wrenching, as I said at the time.<\/p> <p>  I would make two or three points.  First, every single country in the earlier session had said that we had to go for 1.5&deg;C.  For those countries, India and China, we had something of a ringside seat for what was a fairly eventful three hours of haggling because our seat was right beside China's.  We saw the president of the COP, Mr. Sharma MP, and the Americans and everyone coming backwards and forwards.  China and India are at risk more than any other countries from climate change.  Years ago, I went to the Potsdam Institute to see the 4&deg;C world, which was an assessment by the institute which was brilliant on climate meteorology.  You could see that the centre of India was not habitable in a 4&deg;C world.<\/p><p>They will have to switch from using coal.  The only question is when.  While it was deeply disappointing and took much of the shine off the final agreement, it should not take from what has been a step change in the recognition across the world that we need to do this.  Saudi Arabia and Russia said nothing.  There may have been 500 fossil fuel campaigners at the conference, but everyone agrees increasingly that fossil fuels will have to be history.  It is just a matter of how quickly we can make the switch.  It is just to give people some hope.  That wording was in the political part of the text, not in the legal structures the Paris Agreement has to deliver.<\/p><p> The Chinese and Indian approach is because they are under a similar perspective in that they have to, as they see it, protect and provide for their populations.  They are not doing it the right way by continuing with coal, but we have to be careful about depicting other countries in some ways.  We need to look at our own switch-off from coal and deliver that first and foremost.<\/p><p> With regard to the just transition here, the Deputy is right that the vast majority of people on low incomes cannot afford to buy electric vehicles.

In the context of our foreign affairs, we would work with many countries in Africa that might be producers of those minerals.  We do not look at our development aid through a climate lens alone; we have to look at the bigger picture.  I will be honest.  We have to look at the volume of cobalt and copper that will be needed.  One of the ways of bringing down the cost of cars would be to push innovative and new car-sharing arrangements.  Most cars are parked 95% of the time.  One of the ways of bringing down the cost of cars is to promote car-sharing systems where everyone can get access to a car and where the copper and cobalt in those vehicles is efficiently used all the time, rather than just 5% of the time.  The scale of the change and transition we make will evolve; it will not just replicate the current system.  That is one very good way of bringing down the cost.<\/p> <p>  My original role was in transport campaigning.  The basic and obvious thing I learned was that in Dublin city, my city, half of the households did not own cars.  It was as if the entire transport system was all about the other half who did have cars.  The switch to public transport investment and active travel by walking and cycling is a social justice issue as much as a transport and climate issue.  It is recognising that many families cannot afford a car.  If we invest 2:1 in buses and the public transport system, versus roads, it is not just good for climate, it is good for social policy.  That is not to say that someone who is driving a car is bad.  It is just recognising the reality.  Large numbers, approximately 45%, of Dublin city householders do not own a car.  They were forgotten about for decades in terms of where the priorities and investment should be.  That is part of the social justice agenda, as we deliver a just transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#K00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The Minister opened by mentioning the question of the carbon budgets.  We should be front-loading more action into the first carbon budget.  We do not have the balance right.  For any of us in politics, the moment we are there in a room and able to act is the moment to do so.  On page 23 of the action plan, there is a reference to the sequestration potential of trees.  The latter will only come to fruition after 2030.  I am concerned because the language seems to suggest they may be counted earlier.  There is a reference that double-counting or counting them later will be avoided.  The key thing is that our carbon budgets need to be real and they need to be real to the period to which they apply.  There is also reference to future technology.  The Minister will recall that it is a specific recommendation of this committee that future potential removal technologies in respect of emissions would not be counted within a period.  If they deliver dividends for the 2030-35 budget, so be it, but let us deal with it then.  I am concerned that there is a blurring of the lines, especially in the context of how land-use and land-change emissions and the technology are being approached.  I would like to have clarity on that in the plan.  That will be important.<\/p> <p>  Another reason we should be front-loading action is because right now we have access to extremely low-cost, 0% loans at EU level.  We have also been given funding from the recovery and resilience fund.  That is one part of it.  There are very low-cost loans available at present and the fiscal rules have been suspended.  That is why I am really concerned that the narrative of putting things off-balance sheet and so forth is still in the mix.  Those are the old rules.  We need to be very clear that a financialised approach whereby we add private profit into what we do on climate change will be a problem.  That does seem to be the approach.  We should not be trying to mobilise private finance.  It needs to be mobilised, but we have sticks to do that, as well as carrots.<\/p> <p>  Will Ireland actively advocate for a loss-and-damage facility and press the EU to support it at COP27?

However, the recommendation is the right thing to do in the context of recognising that forestry is very complicated in terms of the sequestration of carbon.  There is often a decade delay between planting and seeing carbon being sequestered.  To manage and increase the early flows of funding into that, the recommendation was that it would be measured over a three-decade period, including in this first decade.  We will make sure that it is not a double-counting, but the Climate Change Advisory Council felt the timing of the counting in that way would see a significant increase in the level of forestation.  We need to go from 2,500 ha to the sort of figures of up to 20,000 ha we were doing in the 1990s.  We need a different form of forestry.  It needs to be switched away from a clearfell monoculture-type system, which does not have as good of storage characteristics and other biodiversity consequences, to massively scale up new agroforestry, such as close to nature, continuous cover and other forestry systems.  The Climate Change Advisory Council advice on this is good and we will look to follow it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to financialisation, I do not intend that at all, but we need private as well as public finance.

The key objective is bringing that down.<\/p> <p>  I want to move on, because the one part of the Senator's question that I particularly want to address is the loss and damage issue.  It was central to the negotiations in Glasgow.  Going back to what I said earlier, I believe we have a good story to tell, because firstly, we are already meeting the target which was agreed in Glasgow that half of our climate finance should be spent on adaptation.  Also, the real strength we have is that our climate finance is not tied.  It is grant-based, not loan-based, so we have a really good story to tell.  We committed to increase it by 140% over the next five years.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of loss and damage, coming out of Glasgow, it was agreed that a dialogue would have to start.  One of the proposals I made, within the negotiations, is that Ireland would be willing to support and help developing countries in hosting such a dialogue to enable us to address the issue in a real and meaningful way.  It was critical that the wording around that was clarified.  We started off with wording around whether we would have a workshop.  The developing countries rightly said that was not good enough.  What I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, who was also in Glasgow, said was that we would step up and use our resources to help such a dialogue to deliver a programme of loss and damage supports.<\/p> <p>  Beyond that, there is also the Santiago Network, which came out of a previous COP, to start delivering on some of the loss and damage issues.  In Glasgow, we committed an additional &euro;5 million, along with Germany, Denmark and Luxembourg, to allow the operation of that network to deliver on loss and damage commitments.  It is not easy.  Other countries that were party to the negotiations that I was privileged to be involved in are very reluctant and feel that the commitments breach their political red lines.  However, in respect of the role of Ireland in this, I think the nature and quality of our aid programme, our development aid work and our connections to developing countries places us well to try to advance the understanding of what the needs are and how to deliver support for loss and damage and adaptation.  They are very much connected in the developing world.  We agreed that we will come back to the COP in Egypt next year with a very real programme of work done.

In one of his earlier responses, he mentioned that transport is the hardest sector in which to achieve the emissions cuts that we need to achieve by 2030.  In another answer, the Minister mentioned the modelling around the various strategies that are underway at the moment.  The transport strategy for the greater Dublin area was published by the NTA in the last week.  The Minister mentioned that the modelling is perhaps not sophisticated enough.  I am taking from that that the Minister agrees with me that it is a blunt instrument.  He expressed the belief that we can go further than the percentage modal shift that is set out in the greater Dublin area strategy.  Certainly, I would like to see a much greater modal shift outlined in the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy.  When we see the figures of 4% mode share for cycling by 2040, never mind 2030, it does impact of the confidence of people in the cities.  The Minister rightly pointed out that it is just modelling, but should our transport strategies not have strategic targets separate to the modelling?  I think that would be important to drive more sophisticated modelling and ambition.  Currently, when we look at the transport strategies, it does not seem that they are aligned with the climate ambition that we have or the vision that we have set out in transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#L01200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>First, that modelling is very sophisticated.  Some of our best people are working on it, and really good computing power and detailed data are going into it.  It is not lacking sophistication.  The point I was making earlier is that the assumptions around modal shift, in my mind, sometimes underestimate what is actually possible and what people will do when safe conditions are created.  When the safety impediment of the current environment is removed or when the quality of the service of public transport is improved, in my experience, I have never seen the public response err on the lower side.  That is the point I was making.<\/p> <p>  The other point I wish to make is that while we can always focus on the modellers or the plan, and so on, the reality is that this will be decided at a local political level.  Last week, the Oireachtas debated, on Second Stage, the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021.  I believe Second Stage is concluding this Thursday.  I will make my own contribution in the closing comments.  To a certain extent, it is up to the local authorities and councillors to make some of the decisions.  The national policy will be framed in the new sustainable mobility plan that we are developing.  To make it work, to deliver BusConnects for Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Dublin, to connect rural Ireland to bus services and give the bus primacy through our towns, requires a political commitment at a local level and that is very hard to model.  It is based on how much public support we have for the scale of the transition we need to make.  It is difficult to model how much vision we have, collectively, to make the change.  My sense is that across all parties, that is changing and there is increased understanding that the towns that can create a beautiful public realm and a safe space around schools and can support new bus services are the towns that people are going to want to live in.  They are the places that are really attractive and will attract jobs.  They are the places that will get us into a virtuous cycle.  I do not think we are far away from that in towns and cities right across this country.  That is what I am saying.  It is very hard to model how the virtuous circle works, but when it does work, it can deliver more significant changes than people expect.<\/p> <p>  The Danes and the Dutch are not different from the Irish.<\/p><p>Copenhagen and Amsterdam are actually wetter, colder and darker than Dublin.  They were not always cycling; they changed because of political decisions in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  Those cities are aiming for a 50% split in terms of active travel.  I do not see why we should be any different.  We are just starting a bit later.  That is why I was saying the modelling might not quite pick it up, but first and foremost we need the political commitment to make it happen.  That is something no one can model.  That is in our hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#L01300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The Minister will be aware of the concern about the ranges and the fact that the upper end of the ranges only barely add up to the 51%.

Farmer income is key and protecting the Irish family farm is key.  My input in supporting loans for that industry was to ensure we apply conditionality on all such loans and supports.  Those companies need to play their part in the decarbonisation including: scope 1, what the consumption of the product involves; scope 2, what their production system involves; and scope 3, what their suppliers are engaged in.  Going on memory, the conditionality on loans relates to their own production process and the requirement for any such grant support to be based on their investing in their heat systems and environmental performance indicators.  They have a role to play.  They need to go green.  If they are trading on an origin green brand, they need to be origin green in everything they do.  Regarding that lending, my recollection is that our central involvement was in ensuring that those environmental criteria were stitched into any supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#M00800","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>There was a question from Senator Higgins on the ranges adding up to 51%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021111600002#M00900","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>That is the sort of detail I would love to get from the committee in getting recommendations for the carbon budgets.

Safetynet Primary Care is a medical charity providing primary care and health screening to marginalised groups within society.  We work to address the gaps between what vulnerable groups need healthwise and what is provided by mainstream services.  The gap is a reflection of priorities in society and is ever changing.<\/p> <p> The emphasis of our work has changed from almost exclusively providing care to people who experience homelessness to a new position whereby half of our work is being targeted at who we call the global homeless.  In a globalising world, where the arbitrary borders defining countries are not proving as effective at containing destitution and persecution as they were in the past, migrants are increasingly becoming a part of Ireland&rsquo;s present and future and, therefore, need to be included in our health and social service planning.  However, where migrants are made vulnerable because of structural barriers imposed through systems and services designed for and by the non-migrant population they can and do suffer.  In this way, we as a host country miss an opportunity to reap the economic and social gain.  This is where we are at now.<\/p> <p>  The category of migrants Safetynet encounters, who have high needs and low service levels, include the Roma, protection applicants, who are asylum seekers, and those who end up in homeless services.  The situation is complicated when there is no eligibility to social protection or housing, no access to GPs even with eligibility and no interpreting services are available.  Pre-migration experiences can leave people with a complete distrust of authority and a lack of confidence in health systems.  Navigating health services can be very difficult without literacy or digital literacy.  The medical card application process is extremely labour intensive and bureaucratic.  It requires people to be taken on by a GP before they can apply for a medical card.  Transient addresses and people moving around and being moved around means follow-up medical care is not possible.<\/p> <p>  Our recommendations involve reversing the structural barriers.  Protection applicants should have access to medical care and assessment immediately on claiming asylum.  The Roma specifically are very disadvantaged.  My colleague, Dr. Skuce, will speak more about them.  The systems for engagement with State bodies, health and social services are outdated.  They have been designed or have evolved to cater for the needs of a homogenous population born and bred in Ireland, who speak English and who are culturally similar.  Access to interpreting so that engagement with State bodies is possible should be mandatory.  Our systems and services require future-proofing for the multicultural society we are fast becoming.  Largely, people come to Ireland to make a better life, to work and to be healthy and happy.  Structural barriers make them vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair, clerk and members of the committee for inviting us here today.  We have often fought very hard to be included in spaces where decisions are being made for us and on behalf of us so it is a really big achievement for us to be here and present today.  My name is Yara.  I am a board member of, and volunteer with, Amal Association.  I am joined by Ms Nor Nasib, the treasurer and secretary of the organisation.<\/p> <p>  I will explain who we are and what we do.  Amal means \"hope\" in Arabic, and very simply that is what we aim to espouse  We give hope to women by supporting them and providing direction and guidance to meet their needs.  We are a women-led organisation.  We provide front-line services to Muslim women and women with a connection to the Muslim community nationwide, including ethnic migrant women and refugees.  Our mission is to create a community support network that bring hope to Muslim women across Ireland.  Our vision is for an Ireland where all women can live free from violence, poverty, racism, discrimination and stigma.  We believe in the cultural and religious rights of women and their families to access the services that meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  Every year, we help hundreds of Muslim and migrant women with a range of issues and challenges.  In particular, we help women experiencing gender-based violence and support those accessing health and mental health services.  We support families dealing with State services, including housing, immigration and social or domestic problems.  We are often the first port of call for these women and families and we then provide a support and referral service.<\/p> <p>  I will give a background on some of the research and investigative work we have been doing.  We recently conducted and launched our A Mother is Born Too research, led by Dr. Camilla Fitzsimons from Maynooth University and supported by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It explored Muslim women&rsquo;s experiences in maternity care settings in Ireland.<\/p><p>The research also included healthcare workers and their experience in caring for Muslim women.  Before I discuss the findings, I will preface it by saying that Muslim and non-Muslim women have positive experiences in Irish hospitals, with individual acts of kindness that have made a huge difference in their lives.  This is especially so for first-time mothers who do not have family to support them during what is one of the most significant and challenging times of their lives.  I pay my respect and great gratitude to the healthcare workers who show heavenly care and patience, both during COVID and in ordinary times.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the findings of the research allude to a more systematic issue.  One of the very concerning findings that came out of this research was that 4% of the participants when pregnant presented to the hospital, for the first time during their maternity, when they were in labour.  This signals the barriers preventing expectant mothers from receiving the necessary medical attention and support they need before and post labour.  Other findings found that many women experienced microaggressions in the form of general negative attitudes towards them.  There were also incidents of macroaggressions, mostly verbal abuse, with women reporting being shouted at, told to remove their head scarves and hostile attitudes towards their need to remain as modest as possible in their clothing.  Hospitals also frequently fell short in their obligations to provide an appropriate diet and effective interpretation services.<\/p><p> There are massive discrepancies in the State healthcare system when it comes to accommodating and providing culturally appropriate healthcare.  Findings from engagement with healthcare workers signalled 31% of healthcare workers witnessing racism and discrimination towards Muslim women by other healthcare workers, 74% of healthcare workers were unaware of any policies in respect of providing quality, culturally specific care for Muslim women and one in five healthcare workers acknowledged shortcomings in their practice, referencing a gap in their knowledge relating to Muslim culture and a lack of confidence in their capacity to deliver appropriate care.  As such, we need to remove the impediments for undocumented migrants, establish greater community support, educate healthcare workers in consultation with educators and experts as modelled by the UK&rsquo;s cultural competence programme and ensure clear anti-racism policies in healthcare settings.<\/p><p> To end, I wish to mention some of the many services we have established and some we hope to develop, which like all other grassroots initiatives rely on stable and continual State funding streams.  The cultural advocacy and mediation project, CAMP, addresses the difficulties faced by Muslim women and women with connections to the Muslim community.  CAMP provides peer-led accompaniment and mediation services to Muslim and migrant women, empowering them with access to public services.  The Amal Association court accompaniment service provides culturally appropriate and emotional support for Muslim women required to attend court.  This includes practical support such as legal terminology translations and clarifications and guiding the court user on follow-up procedures.  We aim to establish a bespoke migrant women&rsquo;s refuge centre.<\/p><p> We have a yellow sticker initiative which was created against the backdrop of a very concerning increase in hate crime incidents against the migrant community.  The objective of the initiative is that victims of hate crime and racist attacks could enter a space at the nearest point to the incident.  That would include a retailer, local business or supermarket and a brief training would be given to the agreed parties about their role as a helper in such an incident.  The victim could then access relevant support, assistance and the authorities in the meantime.  We have our ongoing essential services and packages to asylum seekers in direct provision centres.  Every Ramadan and Eid, we provide packs to families and individuals to ensure their basic needs are being met.  This includes non-perishable foods, clothing, sanitary packs and toys and gifts for children.<\/p><p> Ms Nor Nasib and I are happy to take any questions the members may have.

I am accompanied by Ms Sancha Magat, who is the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, drop-in centre co-ordinator.<\/p> <p>  For 20 years, MRCI has been working with migrant workers in precarious and low-wage sectors of the labour market, across agrifood, fisheries, home care, domestic work, car washes, entertainment, cleaning and restaurants.  In 2020, we provided information, support and advocacy in 3,442 cases.  One third of the people who come to our services are undocumented.  How a person enters the country and the person's corresponding immigration status determine the person's rights and entitlements in the State and mediate the person's experiences.  This includes how people experience State and social services and receive supports.  Many people who access our services are in situations of vulnerability due to their immigration status, the type of employment permit they hold, poor conditions of employment, their housing situation and their family and personal circumstances.  These are compounded by delays in immigration processing, problems changing employer, delays renewing employment permits, the habitual residence condition, limits to family reunion, being a victim of trafficking for labour exploitation, domestic violence, lack of access to State supports including sick pay and housing and homelessness support, isolation and numerous other issues including discrimination and racism.<\/p> <p>  I will set out a number of priorities.  It is not an exhaustive list because it is a far-reaching topic.  We are happy to take questions on this.  Through our experience with workers in the agrifood and meat processing sectors we found there is massive experience of exploitation, bullying, harassment, discrimination and health and safety issues.  This is compounded by low levels of training by employers, lack of access to information and supports, vulnerability of being on employment permits and language limitations.  Injuries at work go unreported due to the lack of sick pay schemes or State supports.  People simply cannot afford to be sick and therefore do not engage with the State.  In one's first year in this country one is not entitled to sick pay, so for the first year there is no engagement with the State, particularly for people from non-EEA countries.  Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic there were very difficult circumstances, especially for meat factory workers.  There were problems with contact tracing and following up in a language people could understand, so there were more outbreaks than necessary.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the employment permit system, there is currently a renewed demand for essential workers on employment permits.  A number of jobs have been removed from the ineligible list in healthcare and construction and there are new quotas in meat processing and horticulture.   The system limits mobility and people are afraid to speak out for fear of bullying and harassment.  They continue to be tied to one employer.  Putting rights in the hands of workers, which allows people to have control over their lives, is something we would like this committee to support, particularly the Employment Permits (Consolidation and Amendment) Bill 2020 to give gradual mobility to workers after two years, an immediate right to family reunion and the right to work for spouses and dependants, similar to the rights of critical skills workers.<\/p> <p>  As regards undocumented children, being undocumented impacts on people's ability to access child benefit due to the habitual residence condition.  There are also long-term impacts on children in terms of accessing school and education and on their long-term needs.  It is important to recognise and welcome the incoming regularisation scheme due to be announced shortly.  However, we believe it is vital that as many children of undocumented families as possible are included in this.  It is something we will be asking the committee to support.<\/p> <p>  During the pandemic there was an approach where firewalls were introduced between Departments so that no data were shared if an undocumented person came forward.  It was a very welcome development between Departments.  It meant it gave confidence to people to access services.  We would like to see this retained and then expanded to the labour inspectorate and across all State services.  Undocumented people do not have access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  This is a real infringement on workers' rights.  The legislation must be amended to ensure all workers have access to these bodies.<\/p> <p>  With regard to victims of domestic violence, our service sees many people who continue to face barriers in accessing services.<\/p><p>Recently, the Department of Justice introduced measures allowing people to retain their status, but those are only applicable to spouses registered as dependants and only under certain conditions.  Undocumented people who are victims of domestic violence have little access to shelters, refuges or emergency accommodation.  There is a lack of comprehensive policy or legislation in this area.<\/p><p> There is a lack of quality interpretation and translation services across all State services.  Currently, there is no accredited training course for interpreters, no accreditation system to establish whether interpreters are competent and no system of control to monitor interpreting.  In industries where migrant workers have limited language proficiency and they account for the majority of the labour force, State inspections are often carried out with no language provision.  This means that Health and Safety Authority or labour inspectors go into a workplace but no one is able to interpret or understand what is happening.  In addition, there is inadequate implementation of language provision across public services.  This approach has resulted in people who are victims of crime or who have experienced exploitation finding public sector workers such as garda&iacute;, healthcare workers and community workers as cold, indifferent or disrespectful, which further marginalises people.  Obviously, public service workers do their best in very limited circumstances, which can be frustrating for them all.<\/p><p> We would make a number of recommendations.  We urge the committee to write to the Minister for Justice urgently to ensure that the upcoming regularisation scheme is broad and inclusive and reduces some of the qualifying criteria for children and families to access it.  The scheme is imminent in the next week or so.  We urge the committee to write to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in support of giving mobility to workers after two years and to ask him to consider the upcoming sick pay legislation in order to enable workers to benefit from it effectively.  As matters stand, it is not clear that people will.  We recommend the introduction and maintenance of firewalls and that all front-line staff be provided with the tools to deliver quality services, including access to quality interpretation, and training on bias and anti-racism.  We recommend that delays in renewals of immigration status be addressed, that independent status for all victims of domestic violence be ensured, that State accreditation and a quality control system for interpreters be developed and that resources be provided to organisations like the ones at this meeting so as to ensure that their services are quality and can deliver for people.<\/p><p> We welcome members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGinley.

I have a question for Ms Alagha.  I was struck by the \"A Mother is Born Too\" research and Ms Alagha's comment about some \"individual acts of kindness\".  That statement says a great deal about our system, namely, that kindness, decency and respect are not the default.  I found much in what she said shocking and upsetting, but I found that especially upsetting as a mother who has gone through our maternity services.  We have a national maternity strategy.  I looked it up just now - \"diverse\" is only mentioned once or twice, as is \"inclusion\".  In reviewing the strategy, how best can we work to amend it in order to ensure that, when women present to our maternity services, they feel welcome and comfortable and are looked after during one of the scariest and most special times of their lives?<\/p> <p>  My second question is for Ms McGinley.  I have heard an incredible number of stories of exploitation from undocumented people living in this country.  They are incredibly frightened.  They are living in substandard conditions.  They are tied to their employers, as Ms McGinley said, and marginalised from society.  Ms McGinley set out a large number of recommendations.  I have been working on trying to push measures with the Minister for Justice, so I am glad for Ms McGinley's highlighting of a number of extra ones.  Do we know how many undocumented workers there are in the country?  They and their families are working and living in this country but the are being treated disgracefully.  Some deeply upsetting stories have come across my desk of families being put into terrible conditions and treated badly.  We are awaiting legislation.  Do we know how many undocumented workers there are in this country?  What is the best advice that I can give to someone who comes to my office looking for help?  I am trying and am working with the system.  Does Ms McGinley believe that these migrant workers feel free to present to the MRCI?  I often believe it is seen as officialdom even though it is separate to officialdom and that any sort of authority is seen as a threat.  Is there a barrier to putting a hand up to even an open door like the MRCI?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#C00300","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  The national maternity strategy was Ireland's first ever maternity strategy to be developed.  It came about because of recommendations from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and was commissioned after the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar.  While it is meant to be an inclusive strategy in light of that context, it fails to address specifically the absence of culturally appropriate services within maternity care.  The HSE also has the national intercultural health strategy, which promises an integrated approach to healthcare for users from diverse and ethnic backgrounds who may face health inequalities, but it contains very basic information on religious and cultural contexts.<\/p> <p>  In the review of the strategy, we need to consider more comprehensive guidelines and best practice guidance similar to those adopted by the NHS in the UK, which deals with best practice from the moment a child is born and maternity care to elderly care and end-of-life care.  At every point, we need to ensure that a person's dignity is preserved and faith is respected.  We can all agree on that, but the question is how to do a better job.  While our research covered a small proportion of people from one faith, I am sure that much could be said about research done on people of different faiths and their experiences of engaging in healthcare and other State care settings.  The extent to which these strategies are implemented and met remains uncertain because we do not have the necessary disaggregated data.  We will never know until we have the relevant research.  Our research highlights that perhaps these strategies are either not being implemented or are not enough.  This matter needs to be investigated, starting with reviews of the guidelines.  Are they working in practice?  Do they need to be strengthened?  Do they need to be better enforced?  Do healthcare workers need to be better informed and how do we go about doing that?  For example, would it be through mandatory training sessions?  These are all questions that the Department of Health, in conjunction with the Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, needs to be looking into.  We in the Amal Association would love to see this matter being hashed out further and discussed in committee and by the relevant Ministers.  I hope that answers the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Yara Alagha"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Does Ms McGinley wish to answer the other question briefly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#C00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

We are conscious the scheme is imminent.  A push from a committee such as this one would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  The barriers faced by those who come to us are isolation, exploitation in particular sectors, language limitations and, perhaps, a lack of knowledge of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland as an entity.  Another key aspect if people are to take action or combat exploitation is that they need to be able to take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.

The research is excellent.  It is horrifying to hear of the experiences and discrepancies she described, as well as the macroaggressions and microaggressions.  I can only imagine just how invasive, difficult and challenging that is, particularly in maternity, but also across all health services.  It is very important.  I am a little shocked that no training in cultural and religious sensitivities is available at this stage, given that having a fantastic multicultural society is not a new thing in Ireland.  It has been the case for pretty much my entire adult life, which is, unfortunately, a longer period than I care to accept.  There is no excuse at this point for that need not to foreseeable and taken on board.

Outside the Houses, I am an employment lawyer by profession and have been approached for advice on many occasions through the years by undocumented people.  I have had to explain to them that if one does not have the right to work, one does not have a right to the protections in place for workers, and that is unfortunate.  However, it is a criminal offence for an employer to employ an undocumented person, so there is leverage.  I have tended to use that leverage when negotiating with and pushing back on an employer, on a <i>pro bono<\/i>and unofficial basis, in such cases.<\/p><p>It is problematic that employment permits are attached to employers.  It gives them too much say and control and, invariably, that is at the root of bullying, control and coercion of people in many instances.  Arising from the issues relating to the meat processing industry during Covid, I spent a long time thinking about how to get employment rights into the hands of people.  Even if there were an information campaign on national radio or in newspapers, it would probably be in English.  There is a need to meet people in their communities.  For example, I started thinking about whether the church on High Street is a Polish church and whether that area is frequented by the Polish community.  We need to consider where people gather and whether we could get information to them in those sites.  I would be interested in any ideas our guests have to empower people to know how and to where they can reach out.  For example, they should know that going to the WRC should not cost money.  Having those rights of access is important.

Dr. Skuce is our medical director and general practitioner, GP.  She works across many of our services and will be able to relate how people come to meet her as a doctor in those services.  Safetynet Primary Care provides homeless services to homeless populations and people in homeless hostels.  We also have outreach services, such as mobile GP and nursing services, that meet rough sleepers and bring healthcare there.<\/p><p>We also have a number of clinics for people who find it particularly difficult to access healthcare.  We have a GP clinic in Summerhill in the HSE inclusion health hub.  That area has a lot of migrants living in it who have no access to primary healthcare.  The clinic is a safety net for them and it provides daily GP clinics.  The Roma population is very marginalised and has quite poor health.  Dr. Skuce will tell the committee about the Cappuchin centre where she runs a GP clinic and we have another clinic out in Tallaght for Roma people.  We have been asked by the HSE to provide a mobile clinic in Carrickmacross.<\/p><p> Our work with asylum seekers and refugees comes under our mobile health and screening unit.  In 2017 when Ireland was taking in Syrian refugees it was recognised by the HSE's social inclusion unit that there were lots of emergency reception and orientation centres, EROCs, around the country in small places like Ballaghderreen where local GP services did not have the capacity to take in a big number of Syrian refugees.  We we did assessments whereby we sat with people for an hour, with interpreters, and packaged their healthcare needs and then passed them on for further care to the GPs.  Now the GPs are doing that as a matter of course.  That model actually works well.  As there is no room now in the national reception centres, a lot of asylum seekers are in emergency accommodation in hotels around the city with no medical cards and no access to healthcare.  Our teams are going in and providing clinics once or twice a week but this is not adequate.  I will let Dr. Skuce follow up on the question about how the people we engage with get to our clinics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The clinics that we have are easy to access, especially for migrants.  They are based in areas or organisations where those people tend to be anyway.  We go to where people congregate.  The Cappuchin clinic is based in the Cappuchin day centre which is mainly a dinner hall for people in need.  Years ago that centre identified a need for healthcare so we started a small GP clinic there.  More and more Roma people who were living in homeless accommodation, in squats in the inner city or in very poor quality private rental accommodation came to the clinic and the service grew out of that.  We realised that we needed an interpreter, for example.  Now we have a big clinic and we see between 70 and 100 people per week.  The Tallaght clinic started in response to demand in Tallaght hospital.  There were Roma people living in Tallaght who did not have GPs and they were using the hospital's emergency department as their GP service which was not appropriate for them or for the hospital.  The HSE provided funding for a clinic which we run in Tallaght once a week in a building quite near the hospital.  It is supported by the Tallaght Roma integration project and volunteers from the local Roma community come and act as intermediaries.  People can just turn up at both of those clinics.  They are open-access, walk-in clinics and people find out about them through word of mouth.  In the Cappuchin clinic, we used to get people coming in from Carrickmacross because they had friends or relatives in Dublin who told them about it.  People come to the clinics from the local community.<\/p> <p>  We have very strong links with local community organisations like Pavee Point.  There is also a national Roma Covid information line that was set up in response to the pandemic because we realised that Roma people who do not speak English could not seek healthcare when they had Covid-19 or symptoms of Covid.  We get referrals through that information line.  We also have links with organisations like Mendicity which works a lot with people from eastern Europe and with people who have addiction and homelessness problems.  Mendicity refers people to us.  We also have very strong links with the local hospitals.<\/p> <p>  In reference to the maternity hospitals, there is a really good recent initiative involving the three Dublin maternity hospitals which have created a new post of inclusion health social worker.  We have met the three of them in the last few weeks and they are our direct line in and out for people who are vulnerable for many reasons including being homeless, having addiction issues, not being able to speak English, being undocumented and so on.  We had a problem recently where one of the maternity hospitals, in a drive to modernise and become more efficient and user-friendly, had developed an online registration form for pregnant women.  In one of the maternity hospitals now people do not need a GP referral but can just refer themselves but they must do so by filling in an online registration form in English and uploading documents.  We can now bypass that system by emailing the inclusion health social worker and she will make the appointment.  At the other end, when people have had a baby and are leaving hospital, they may want long-acting contraception because their family is complete or they want to delay another pregnancy but if they do not have a medical card, they do not have access to that.  The inclusion health social workers can refer them directly to one of our clinics, we can book an interpreter and get that sorted.  That works really well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Angela Skuce"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#E00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>We will now move on to Deputy Bacik.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#E00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Does the Chairman want us to answer the questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I will come back to Ms McGinley after Deputy Bacik has spoken because we are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#E00600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for their very useful presentations.

I am really glad that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is working very constructively with us and that we will see reform of our immigration law.  I note that the Migrant Rights Centre in its recommendations asks this committee to write to the Minister for Justice to ensure that the scheme that is forthcoming to regularise people living here is as broad and inclusive as possible.

Finally, on the supports that the witnesses mentioned, things like the yellow sticker initiative is such an interesting and practical idea or the bystander initiative to support bystanders in intervening where they see a hate crime being carried out.  Do the witnesses have any further thoughts on that?  I am also interested in the interpreting service, particularly the Roma Covid information line that Dr. Skuce described.

As I said, the factors are language and fear.  It is not easy to change employers and most employees do not know how to do it.  There is a lot of information.

We know that general practice is busy and practices are full.  The GP whose practice is full is the gatekeeper to all health services for people who are supposedly entitled, but it is not an entitlement.  I will ask Dr. Skuce to address the interpreting issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about the Roma Covid information line, which is a very good example of the issue.  We knew when Covid hit that people who could not speak English would not be able to access anything, including testing, registering for vaccines or anything like that.  Very early on in the pandemic, the HSE gave funding to Cairde, which is an organisation that helps people from other countries to access their healthcare entitlements.  It operates a mobile phone number that, for a long time, seems to have run 24-7, though officially it runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  That line is manned by a member of the Roma community who is trilingual and speaks Roma languages, Romanian and English.  As he works for Cairde, he can help people to get PPS numbers, medical cards and so on.  He also serves as a link for people who do not speak English and also tend to have a great distrust and fear of state services.  He has had hundreds of phone calls over the past year and a half from people who were at home with symptoms of Covid, some of whom were very ill, and were afraid to come forward.  They were afraid that if testers arrived at their house, their neighbours would realise, their house would be burned or they would be evicted.  They were afraid that if they called a doctor, they would be deported or if they went to hospital in an ambulance, they would be given an injection that would kill them and they would die.  They had very deep-seated fears, in addition to the barrier of interpreting.<\/p> <p>  Even though the Capuchin clinic has been working with this community for approximately 15 years, Roma still did not trust us when it came to Covid.  The Covid information line acted as a first point of contact for people who did not speak English and as a trust link.  People would ring up and trust that information line.  The person manning it trusts us and the other services we work with.  Through that information line, he was able to refer people to us for testing and to the self-isolation facility for vulnerable groups.  He was able to link people in with GP services and food delivery services, if they were self-isolating at home.<\/p> <p>  I believe very strongly that interpreting needs to be accessible to the people who need it.  GPs in some areas of the country have access to interpreting services but they have to be booked by the GP.  People cannot make an appointment in the first place if they cannot ring up the GP practice.  There is one very good example of an interpreting project in the south east, which is the south-east Roma project.  It has valuable support workers who are freely available in the community.  People who share a language with those support workers can ring them up or contact them.  Those workers will then phone the local hospital or the patient's GP to say that a particular person needs an interpreter and an appointment at this time.<\/p> <p>  While the HSE has very good and meaningful guidelines on the need for interpreting in healthcare, access to it is in the hands of healthcare providers who are not always best placed to decide if somebody needs an interpreter and are not available as a first point of contact.  That is one matter that should be addressed.  When people are ordinarily resident here, they are entitled to healthcare.  It needs to be accessible and meaningful healthcare.  Interpreting is part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Angela Skuce"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their input.

When labour inspectors come into a workplace they should be there to inspect employees' conditions of work, not their immigration status.  If employees see inspectors in their workplace, they may mistrust them as they may think they are immigration police who will deport them.  The inspectors should be there to inspect their conditions of employment.  We want a firewall to be introduced between the immigration service and the labour inspectorate.<\/p> <p>  We also want the firewalls that have been established in healthcare and social protection to be continued to ensure people have a floor of decency, can access services and overcome some of their fears.

The expansion of the firewall model would be good for society from a crime prevention perspective and for the economy in terms of rooting out exploitation.  It is good for our healthcare system because people need to have access to healthcare for their long-term health.  The same applies to schools and all sectors of society.  If people are asked for a personal public service number and do not have it, they will not engage with the service in question again unless they have supports and people to help them to navigate the service.

I gained some experience from my work on the Safetynet helpline throughout Covid.  I am aware of the work Safetynet does across direct provision and different counties, including in Summerhill and in the hubs.  It spans a wide area.

We have spoken a little about the fear of particular communities and the lack of translators.  What is the human cost of that?  What is the impact of it?  Safetynet deals with a large community.  Is a large part of the Roma community completely underground because of the experience of Roma people in terms of them receiving no healthcare?  What is the impact of not having a translator for those who fear being deported? <\/p><p> Maternity services were mentioned a number of times.  Are Roma women and girls giving birth at home and, as such, living completely under the radar even at that stage?

I will comment on the inadequate service provision and what, owing to capacity, we can or cannot do.  I will ask Dr. Skuce to comment on the impact of those barriers and transience on the health and welfare of, particularly, the Roma community.  Earlier this morning, I spoke to one of our general practitioners, GPs, who is looking after some asylum seekers in emergency accommodation.  She had just seen a man who is new to the country, having fled persecution.  He has physical ailments as a result of being beaten and tortured, but it is his mental health she is really concerned about.  A couple of weeks ago, she referred him to psychiatry for suicidal ideation and he was admitted.  He is now back in the emergency accommodation.  The hospital recommendation was for GP follow-up care, but she is seeing him in his emergency accommodation.  He has no GP, except her, because, as the committee will be aware, we visit sites.  She will need to see him again in two weeks' time but she does not know where he might be in two weeks' time.  This man does not have a phone or an Irish SIM card.  She put him on whatever medication she could, which would be antidepressants which mean follow-up is required.  She also gave him a contact number for Safetynet so that he could call us because we have no idea where he will be in two weeks' time.  That is just an example of the transience issue.  On the Roma community specifically, as I said, Dr. Skuce, will comment on that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the adequacy of service provision, it is more than just a funding requirement for Safetynet.  What I was talking about in my opening address is the completely different world we are coming into, which we have not recognised yet.  Our health systems are built for an Irish population in the Ireland of 50 years ago.  They are built for the local general practitioner who was born in the community and knows everybody in it, including their parents and grandparents.  You cannot even get into services as adults, in particular disability services, because access is reliant on you having grown up here.  We are trying to catch up.  Safetynet is providing emergency primary care, but that is not a system of care that will ever have the capacity to provide primary care for incoming-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>We have lost contact with Dr. O'Reilly.

We all came together and we held teleconferences every two weeks because we knew that they would be very vulnerable to Covid, as they are to every other illness.  Organisations, including the HSE and public health services, went into the local communities and populations of Roma people were identified across the country that previously nobody knew about.  At all levels, some of them were well established and working in mainstream jobs, but many of them for cash-in-hand or on zero hours contracts.  These people are not on anybody's radar because they are bunking in with other people, friends and families who might have tenancies.  Covid revealed this and attempts are now under way to try to map the Roma population across Ireland to identify need, including for services.<\/p> <p>  We started collecting ethnic identifiers for health, especially in regard to Covid.  That revealed two things.  Prior to the vaccination coming on stream, we reckoned that Roma people were ten times more likely to die from Covid than the background population in Ireland.  That is, probably, a reflection of their general health and the circumstances they live in, the social determinants of health more than anything.  Now that we have such good vaccination rates, Roma people are approximately 50 times more likely to die from Covid because they have enormous vaccine hesitancy.  They see the vaccine as an instrument of State control.  They have such distrust in the health service, they think it is going to do them harm.  It has proven very difficult to get any significant vaccine uptake with the Roma community.  <\/p> <p>  On the health in general of the Roma community, they suffer the same health problems as everybody else but their conditions tend to be worse, to occur at higher frequency and to be less well looked after.  They have higher rates of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis, TB.  They tend to have lower childhood vaccination rates and, as such, they might have greater incidence of measles and so on.  They are things that GPs and hospital can manage and the kinds of things that we are used to.  They tend to have large families, starting at a very early age.  That has health and social implications going forward.  When they are able to access good healthcare, good maternity care and appropriate contraception, they do access it.  That improves the outlook for the families as well.  <\/p> <p>  On transiency, it is a huge problem.<\/p><p>Our waiting times for hospitals are long and the bureaucratic processes onerous.  If I refer people to a hospital for something, they might get a validation letter six months' later to ask if they still want to be on the list, because they have moved and missed an appointment.  Those people then come in to tell me that they have moved, and I have to re-refer them to the hospital in the area where they live now, which means that they are back at the bottom of the waiting list.  It is especially striking in cases involving children with special needs because the waiting times in those services are years' long.  There are many instances of children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, or learning disabilities who have moved only a few miles each time, but on each occasion they go back to the bottom of the waiting lists.  Children have got to secondary school age without ever having been assessed.  If we could have a provision where it would be possible for people to go in on the same place on the waiting list as they were at when they were at their last address, that would really help people.  <\/p><p> We have had one good example of how an integrated system and of organisations working together can help.  Early in the pandemic, the HSE funded a self-isolation facility for people who could not access any other such facility.  In the end, as we suspected, most of the people who came through that facility were Roma people.  Many of them were people newly arrived in Ireland, or newly arrived back in Ireland, and who did not have anywhere to quarantine.  It was a nurse-led facility, so everybody coming in got health assessments and their initial applications completed.  They were linked with the health services then and that meant that once they left the facility they were able to continue on in those services.  People presented in labour in that facility and babies were almost born there, but at least there was a nurse on-site who was able to get them into the right place.  However, that facility closed recently.  <\/p><p> Team members have been following up with those who have come through City West, which is closing.  Yesterday, they visited one family in homeless accommodation.  When the family arrived, I think the dad had a job in the waste recycling industry.  They could not afford accommodation, so they applied for Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, homelessness accommodation.  They were eligible, and they were placed in a bed and breakfast in private emergency accommodation.  Unfortunately, there was a problem with domestic violence, and the dad had to leave the facility because his behaviour was unacceptable.  The mum and the five children are now living there.  They are provided with a room to sleep in, bathroom facilities and breakfast every day.  It turns out, however, that the mum's only income is from the children's allowance payments for her four children.  She has no other income, so she is feeding her children for the rest of the day on approximately &euro;500 a month, as well as buying school uniforms and schoolbooks etc.  As a result, the 14-year-old in the family is wearing shoes that are two sizes too small.  All that family needs is an intermediary who can help them to apply for what they are entitled to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Angela Skuce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Skuce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#J00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I could go on, but I will not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Angela Skuce"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Skuce and Senator Ruane.

I am concerned by the point they made about migrant women continuing to encounter barriers in exiting situations of domestic violence, accessing support services and retaining their immigration status.  Most disturbing of all is that our immigration system actually facilitates domestic violence and coercion, in that people' status is linked to that of their partners' and there is no entitlement to retain immigration status following a separation.

Do the witnesses have suggestions for what measures need to be put in place to address that issue?

The issue here is that the Department of Justice has a policy in this area, but it does not include undocumented people.  This policy is highly dependent on the spouse, that is the person who is a kind of guarantor in respect of immigration issues.  People, mainly women, in this type of domestic violence situation are afraid to lose their immigration status.  Without that status, they will not have rights and entitlements.  Even if they wish to access women&rsquo;s refuges, they will have a limited time in that regard.  They will also not be entitled to any social welfare.  There will be issues with child benefit, for example, which might be stopped.  That is why people in these situations are afraid to raise these issues, especially undocumented people.  Therefore, it is probably time for the Government to renew the policy for domestic violence in use in the Department of Justice and to include people who are undocumented in its scope.

I know it is hard with everything that is happening now, but something like that arrangement is one of the suggestions for improvements that I think it would be great to have.<\/p><p>As Ms Alagha has mentioned, the language barrier is very difficult and sometimes they do not really understand what the doctor or the midwife is saying.  Perhaps there could be training for the midwife and the doctors, just to make sure that the migrant or the woman they cater for really understand what they are being asked at the time.  The research tells us that the woman may not understand but she will just nod because she does not want to lose face.  She may then ask her husband or the immediate family what did the doctor talk about as she did not really understand.<\/p><p> I also wish to mention that this research does not cater for some migrants.  We would appreciate it if we could continue the research to get better service, not just for Muslims, but for all migrants in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nor Nasib","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Was that all of Deputy Cairn's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#K00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>How are we for time?

We have a Romanian interpreter in the Capuchin clinic and we are hanging on to her with our fingernails because we know that she is really good.  I have worked with a lot of interpreters when she goes on holidays, and other interpreters in different languages.  The standard is wildly variable.  I have had to ask some interpreters to leave because they were having conversations with the clients and I did not know what they are talking about.  It would be really important that we have standards.  Different countries have accepted standards for interpreting and methods of accreditation.  It would not be difficult for Ireland to do.<br\/><br\/>Certainly, in general practice there is not nearly enough access to interpreting.  We have a special funding stream for that but most of the GPs that I know do not know how to access an interpreter and do not even know that the service exists.  It seems to be dependent on which part of the country one lives in.  Even with the GPs who do have access, it is often difficult to access.  We need a lot more interpreters.  It need not be expensive. There are different models of providing interpreting that can be very cost effective.  Years ago, I worked in London and there are lots of different languages spoken in the area in which I lived.  The local GP practices informally divided up the populations between them.  For example, three practices would do Portuguese, where those practices would have all of the Portuguese and Brazilian community and a full-time interpreter between the three practices so there an interpreter was available every day.  The practice down the road might do Somali and so on.  If a practice employs an interpreter on site all day, he or she can interpret for up 30 different people.  I believe that it worked out at something like &euro;5 per head.  If it is being done in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way, however, through booking an interpreter for somebody for a particular appointment that can work out at &euro;30 per head.  There are lots of very established ways of providing high-quality and cost-efficient interpreting that we could just copy from other countries. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021111600002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Angela Skuce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>To follow up on that point, right now we feel that it is a form of institutional racism.  We do not provide the services that people need.  Equally, it would not be that difficult to introduce a State accreditation system.  People train for years to be interpreters.  It is a very skilled job to interpret professionally for people.  That needs to be recognised.  There are so many very important services that people use such as health, the judicial system or taking a case to the Workplace Relations Commission.  These are very important things that people must navigate.  We do need that system.  Such a skills and accreditation system could probably come under the role of the Department of Education and that ministerial competency.  It could be part of the qualifications framework that we have.  It is important that people have a particular qualification or experience in the area.<\/p> <p>  I believe that Senator Keogan's question referred to unaccompanied minors rather than undocumented children.  The Migrants Rights Centre Ireland works predominantly with children who are born to parents who are undocumented or who came with their parents who are not undocumented.  We do not necessarily work with unaccompanied minors, so I do not have figures for those numbers, unless somebody else may have them.  I understand that if those children are unaccompanied and under the age of 18, they go into the care of Tusla.

I have worked through interpreters in the past, face to face and over the phone.  There are times when the person you are working with talks for five minutes and the interpreter gives a one-word answer.  It is not always the best.  An accreditation scheme would be excellent.  One question I wanted to ask that has been pre-empted is whether any other countries are doing accreditation right.  Dr. Skuce mentioned England.  I agree with Senator Seery Kearney that this is not a new issue for us in terms of multiculturalism but as we are coming to it after other countries, surely we can learn lessons from them.  Can our guests point to other examples of positive things?<\/p> <p>  I am curious about structural issues with interpreters.  Do we have enough interpreters in this country?  Do we have enough people who can speak the right languages?  I have worked with interpreters over the phone and it not the best but it is not the worst and it is certainly better than not having interpreters.  Can we not use a pool of interpreters sitting in the UK, Brexit notwithstanding, or in France?  Perhaps these are questions I should be asking the Department.  I would like an insight into the structural issues around the set-up of the interpreting services.  Are there other places we can learn from in terms of accreditation?  Do we have enough interpreters speaking the right languages?<\/p> <p>  Where a parent does not have any English and his or her child has better English, the child can often be pulled in as an informal interpreter, which can be unfair and problematic as it can be an inappropriate level of responsibility for the child.  There can also be implications relating to the privacy of the parent.<\/p> <p>  Ms Alagha mentioned policy relating to multicultural sensitivity and awareness within the HSE.  I missed the name of the policy, if she would give it again.  I am curious as to what that policy looks like.  Is it aimed at the hospital at large?  If it is, it is probably gathering dust in the office of the hospital administrator or manager.  Is there something on the ward?  Nurses and doctors have all sorts of reference books to which they can turn for correct administration of medication and things like that.  Surely it would be easy to require them to have a folder which tells them about basic cultural awareness.  I appreciate that basic cultural awareness, by definition, is basic and will not meet everyone's needs but it is certainly better than nothing.

There are some very good examples of positive things.  In the Capuchin clinic, we are lucky to have a specialist diabetes clinic.  The Roma population tends to have a high incidence of metabolic syndrome, which includes diabetes, and all the complications that come with it if it is not managed.  We are lucky enough to have a consultant diabetologist, who volunteers and runs a clinic once a month with an outreach nurse and with our interpreter.  Almost all of her patients are non-English speaking Roma people and that clinic has been running for a few years.  Its figures are better than the national average.  These are people living in very poor circumstances, who do not have medical cards, do not speak English and do not have much money to buy great food and that kind of thing.  Their parameters for everything, including eye tests, foot care, blood tests and everything, are better than the national average.  That is because we have a good, familiar and trusted interpreter who has worked with that team for a long time.  That costs a certain amount of money but saves enormous amounts of money, down the line, because if diabetes is poorly controlled, people end up in hospital with lots of complications.  They can be on dialysis for years.  The cost savings for the health service and for disability benefits are enormous.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right about using interpreters from abroad.  We used to have access to a multinational interpreting agency.  We probably have enough interpreters for the more common languages but every now and then, somebody who speaks Mongolian or a language we have little demand for will come in.  When we have that demand, we need interpreters.  We used to be able to access interpreters in the UK through an agency that has offices in Ireland so we would get an interpreter on the phone straight away.

As I briefly mentioned, the mobile health and screening unit is another positive.  It is funded and provided through the HSE social inclusion services, and applies for migrants in the Irish refugee protection programme when we know they are coming over and Ireland has accepted them.  It is designed to ensure they all get a proper 45-minute or one-hour consultation with a doctor and a nurse to unpack their medical problems, any issues with their documentation or the medical history that have come over with them, or assessments that have come from the refugee camps they have been in.  An interpreter for whatever language is required can be booked to be available on-site.  The children's vaccinations record is looked at because they may have missed a load of vaccinations, having been in refugee camps for a number of months or years.  All of that can be packaged and provided to their primary care doctor whose list they will be put on.

If those two issues were delinked, whereby there would be a health card that allowed people to get a certain number of services but not a GP, given that there might not be a GP who had room on his or her list to take more people, they would still be able to go to the dentist, the optician or the hospital if necessary.<\/p> <p>  The other potential solution in respect of medical cards, although this is only in the policy or structural areas, relates to the fact our GPs operate private practices.  They are self-employed.  As a charity, Safetynet is funded.  If more practices or GPs were funded by the State, there would not be that barrier.

There is different vocabulary for different settings.  A lot of that was carried out by the old F&Aacute;S and these programmes have been cut over the years.  They are important.  How do people acquire good language skills and how is that supported by the State and employers?<\/p> <p>  Many people talked about transparency in recruitment and promotion processes internally and addressing discrimination more broadly in accessing the labour market and while in it.

I should make clear in the context of our recommendations and requests that Amal Association, Safetynet and MRCI are not born out of the desire for migrants to have extra rights or more provisions granted to them through growth needs.  The migrant community is still at a level of securing its existence.  Amal Women's Association was established on that basis and is meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged communities.  In the absence of necessary State provisions for migrants, Amal Association fills those gaps and does the work of the State.  For example, there are our yearly Ramadan and Eid campaigns during the most important and holiest month and festivities for Muslims during which they engage in day-long fasts for 30 days.  Amal Association visits direct provision centres and low-income households with packs containing food items that can be consumed when they break their fasts, which in most cases is outside the food-serving hours in direct provision centres.  We also provide essential items such as sanitary packs and try to incorporate a festive feeling for the children with toys and activities during our visit.  They would otherwise be stuck within the four walls of the rooms in the direct provision centre.  We provide basic human necessities to allow a migrant to live a dignified life.

There is little contestation in respect of assessment practice in senior cycle.  Building on the experience of junior cycle, most teachers in senior cycle use a wide variety of assessment methods and give good feedback to students.  Students get a chance to work in groups and they provide feedback to each other on these collaborative tasks.  All of these practices are underpinned by strong research evidence.<\/p> <p>  However, the closer a student gets to the end of senior cycle and the leaving certificate examination, the more likely it is that this rich, rewarding and evidence-based assessment gets displaced by practice for examinations, completion of pieces of coursework and extensive revision with a view to recall under time constraints.  The research on this kind of assessment is less compelling.  Although summative tests with stakes can act as a motivator for some groups of students, most students - and most adults - find them stressful to some degree, with some students being more negatively impacted than others.  In fact, the completion of public examinations such as the leaving certificate run counter to most of the research we know in respect of assessment that supports student learning.<\/p> <p>  Why is this the case? It is because public examinations, including the leaving certificate, are less artefacts of assessment and more artefacts of culture.  Examinations persist because they are social rather than assessment processes.  We still have the leaving certificate not because it reflects best practice in assessment, but because it is culturally embedded.  Despite an annual liturgy of hand-wringing and head-wagging about inequalities in class and gender, concerns for student well-being and pernicious impact on the kind of learning and lives we want for young people, it persists because it has become part of Irish social and cultural life.  For this reason, at the end of the annual liturgy of hand-wringing, the procession of critics, including me, moves back into the sanctuary of the academy or commentariat and concludes that, in the end, sure what else would we do, and sure look at the mess they have made everywhere else, and let us go in peace and do it all again next year.<\/p> <p>  The Canadian philosopher, Charles Taylor, uses the phrase \"social imaginary\" to describe how people imagine their social existence.  He says that social imaginaries exist in the minds of ordinary people - in images, stories, legends and mythologies.  Ireland has a very particular imaginary of public education.  Despite many current debates about the value of vocational knowledge and skills, our imaginary places greater emphasis on theoretical knowledge, one of the consequences of developing an exam system based on paper and pencil tests.  Another defining feature of our imaginary is a conviction that participation in tertiary education is a measure of personal, familial and system success.  An often unspoken of feature is that, ultimately, the leaving certificate does a reasonable job of sorting people into those who have earned and deserve success and those who have not earned it or do not deserve it, a view that is often summed up in one of my favourite phrases: \"It may be brutal, but it is fair\".<\/p> <p>  I will move to the end of my statement in deference to the time constraints.  I am something of a veteran of leaving certificate reform.  I have been the proponent of the slow and steady change.  I led the introduction of coursework and helped design a revised system of grades and points and yet here we are again, on the same themes, identifying the same challenges, ready to embark on a series of changes that will be the result of extensive consultation and probably have broad support, although I expect that students may be more vocal critics than heretofore.  We will design an assessment system that will have a balance between validity, reliability and manageability and that will settle on a series of bearable trade-offs listed in my written submission.<\/p> <p>  UNESCO recently published the report of the International Commission on the Futures of Education.  The report pulls few punches on the crises now faced by the human race and the planet, of which the ongoing pandemic is just the smallest.  The report proposes a new social contract &ndash; a new imaginary - that will deliver on the promise of quality education for all.  One of the most interesting propositions is that, in the future, education is going to have to concern itself not just with learning, but with unlearning.  Looking to the future, the report suggests education will need to support us in our need to unlearn human exceptionalism and possessive individualism.  If we were to make a similar proposition for education in Ireland, particularly in senior cycle as we consider the leaving certificate, what might we want to unlearn?  What behaviours and attitudes does our current examination teach that may be contributing to the crises we now face and stopping our ability to solve them?  There is hyper-competitiveness, possessive individualism and compliance at the expense of creativity.  We could think of others.  According to UNESCO, the new social contract will be built on pedagogies that learn in and with the world, founded on collaboration, co-operation and solidarity.  What might a new educational imaginary for Ireland be founded on?<\/p> <p>  Given where we find ourselves, before we move on to the next edition of the leaving certificate that will further embed our current educational imaginary, should we give time to considering whether this imaginary is the one we want and need to get us through what are going to be the most challenging decades in human history?  Addressing this question and at least putting our current educational imaginary itself through some form of examination, whether through the Citizens' Assembly on education as proposed by the current Government or through another deliberative process, has never been more urgent for us.  If we do not at least question the current educational imaginary, then we are confirming for generations past and to come that it really is all about the points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Looney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I wish to focus my comments on the issue of assessment options for senior cycle.  There is broad consensus in the research literature that high-quality educational assessments are underpinned by several key principles.  The first is that all assessments should be designed to support accurate, consistent and fair decision-making in respect of the progress and achievement of all learners.  The principle that all assessments contain measurement error means that single assessments are a poor basis for making high-stakes decisions about learners.<\/p><p>Think about that.  That is a fundamental principle of assessment.  In addition, while assessment systems provide information to many stakeholders, including policymakers like the committee, learners are the most important users of assessment information.  For this reason a balance needs to be struck between assessments that support learning and those that measure it.  The positive consequences, negative consequences, or both, that derive from the use of an individual assessment or an assessment system mean we must always consider the fallout or what happens when we implement these assessments.  We need to make judgments about quality.<\/p><p> These principles underpin the arguments outlined in my submission and in what I am about to say and why I think the certification of achievement at the end of senior cycle needs to be based on the outcomes of a broad range of assessment approaches.  I offer four proposals for consideration.  The first is exams spread out over fifth and sixth year with reduced content that, in time, move from paper-based to computer-based so that the power of digital technology can be leveraged to broaden the scope of what can be assessed with exams.  The second is continuous assessments that involve a combination of tasks externally set and marked by say, the State Examinations Commission, SEC, but also tasks assessed by the student&rsquo;s own teacher.  The third is the collective judgment of in-school teams of teachers about the achievement of students across the key skills framework for senior cycle.  That must count for something.  It cannot be on one side of a certification page that does not count the same as physics and maths.  My fourth proposal is perhaps the most radical thing I am going to say today.  It consists of an element of student self-assessment contributing to decisions around the grading of some assignments and, in particular, competences associated with the key skills framework.  Data from all four modes of assessment would support a more balanced system of certifying achievement at the end of post-primary education in Ireland.<\/p><p> However, there are obstacles.  There is no magic bullet with assessment.  It is a difficult thing.  The potential for over-assessment and increased workloads and stress for students and teachers is a threat that needs to be considered when evaluating the proposals I have written about.  My last point has been said many times.  The current relationship between the leaving certificate examination and the CAO points system poses a formidable barrier not just to what I am proposing but to what many others are proposing as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me to make this submission.  The brief I have had from the clerk since last February has been focusing on the curriculum-assessment relationship as it is.  Unlike the previous two presentations, that is the focus it will have.<\/p> <p>  The good working relationship between the Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the SEC facilitates the development of assessment standards.  While the NCCA is currently replacing its subject syllabuses with curriculum specifications, 29 of the 37 leaving certificate subjects remain in syllabus form.  Due to the paucity or indeed absence of curriculum objectives in subject syllabuses, the development of performance standards therefore depends mainly on inference.  The clear focus of curriculum specifications on the other hand is on higher- and lower-order student learning outcomes stated in behavioural terms.  While this facilitates the development of performance standards, the move away from content is a cause of concern to teachers.  The specific specifications also include information about assessment modes and criteria.  The relationship between these curriculum documents and classroom implementation can be rather distant due to the complex nature of assessment and the backwash effect of examinations.  It is noteworthy that senior cycle is now the only sector where students take terminal examinations after two years&rsquo; work.<\/p> <p>  When the joint Oxford University and Queen&rsquo;s University research team analysed six leaving certificate subject exams in detail, it found three of them to be problematically predictable.  Students also felt the exams were predictable while teachers did not.  The predominance of lower-order outcomes emerges when you see that many students believe the exams are over-reliant on recall while teachers believe the content-heavy subject syllabuses we have encourage teaching to the test and the textbook.  Draft marking schemes are prepared in conjunction with exam papers.  However, since our grade parameters are fixed, when grade distribution problems arise the only option is to adjust the marking schemes.  The SEC believes these problems are indicative of issues with the examination rather than the student cohort, so using expert judgments and statistics, that is, attainment referencing, it compares the attainment of the cohort in question with previous years' cohorts and candidates are then graded on their overall attainment rather than the performance standards for that subject.<\/p> <p>  Other than their value in CAO points, the meanings of particular grades are not capable of definition.  In the interests of their relationships with students, teachers see their role in assessment as being advocates rather than judges.  This is not necessarily an either-or dilemma but change can only happen under certain preconditions and where the authenticity of student responses is assured.  That is a really important point.  Ethical aspects of assessing one&rsquo;s own students for national certification are of direct relevance to the Teaching Council&rsquo;s code of professional conduct and the whole issue of teacher professionalism.  There are obviously important lessons to be learned from the assessment arrangements used during the pandemic, from the implementation of the junior cycle framework and from the leaving certificate applied, LCA.  For valid curriculum reasons the LCA was ring-fenced in 1995.  In my opinion and with some experience in this field, one would need good reasons to change that arrangement.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, might I say to the committee that when confronted with NCCA proposals for reform in 1995, the political establishment at that time demurred?  The ball is in the committee&rsquo;s court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jim Gleeson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I am going focus briefly on two issues, namely, the reform of the leaving certificate and the current specifications for the revision of subjects.  In reforming the leaving certificate, I strongly favour additional forms of assessment for every subject that could be carried out during, and not at the end of, the two-year senior cycle, so that by May or June of the final year, students would already have completed at least 50% of leaving certificate assessments.  Assessments undertaken during the school year could be done under teacher supervision and sent to the SEC for assessment.  This could, for example, include English and Irish essays as well as some of the questions on unseen aspects of the leaving certificate in other subjects.  The subject syllabuses, or specifications as they are now called, could be modularised, as is now the norm in most higher education courses, with assessment carried out at the end of each module.  Third level students have found this considerably less stressful than everything being examined at the end of the final year.  Some assessments could take place at the end of fifth year and others could take place around the time of the Christmas tests in sixth year or at other times during the final year.  There should be plenty of choice on the exam papers and not the narrow focus, and guessing game, that currently exists for many subjects.  In my view, external assessment should be the norm.  A student's own teacher should not normally be asked to assess his or her students for certification purposes.  To conclude on that aspect of it, while we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, we need to seriously rethink how the leaving certificate assesses, examines and certifies.<\/p> <p>  I have other points in my submission but I will move on to the final point on the current specifications.<\/p><p>Even though the Minister has not yet announced whether there will be the leaving certificate as we know it, the NCCA is going ahead with revising subjects in a new way and introducing new syllabi or specification, as has been mentioned.  For example, the recently introduced specification for Irish at junior cycle is problematic and I have written about it previously.  Some members may have read that.  The proposal has been strongly criticised and opposed by Irish language organisations and Irish teachers.  Even though the Minister has not announced her proposals, the NCCA is proceeding with revising the individual subject syllabi.  There is considerable concern among subject organisations and teachers about the format or template being used by the NCCA to design the new subject specifications.  While the design template may be suitable for school-based programmes or courses that are not externally assessed, it is not suitable for a programme or course that is externally assessed and a high-stakes examination such as the leaving certificate.  The specifications are skeletal and lack clarity.  They contain only themes and learning outcomes with no detail on the material to be taught, teaching approaches, literature, texts or assessment.  There is no information about how the course content will be aligned with assessment to ensure national consistency and coherence. Under the Education Act 1998, the role of the council is to advise the Minister on both curriculum and assessment so I would argue that any change in curriculum should be accompanied by very clear guidelines and explanations of how it will be assessed.  This current revision is an opportunity for the council to go back to the drawing board and look at assessment in light of the points I have made.  <\/p><p> If we are talking about international evidence and best practice, I have examined the syllabi of 12 countries and jurisdictions, including the International Baccalaureate, to see if any other country provides such a skeletal outline for its individual subjects and have not found a single country where we are talking about a public examination externally assessed.  I would argue that the NCCA should adopt international best practice and provide full information for teachers, students and, where appropriate, textbook producers, well in advance of the new specifications being introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I now invite Professor Collins to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#F00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>My first point is that I do not think it is possible to have a discussion about assessment reform without discussing curricular reform.  The two cannot be decoupled but assessment is the tail that wags the curricular dog.  The task of reform then begins with decisions regarding assessment.  As has been observed by Professor Looney, as the two-year senior cycle comes to a close, all involved in the cycle become consumed by the looming examination.  It seems to me that the assessment debate might begin with the question of what it is hoped to achieve in the senior cycle, what needs to be given currency in the assessment process and what can be ignored for the purposes of assessment. but it should be borne in mind that what is ignored in assessment in upper second level comes also to be ignored as a serious curricular endeavour.  This may be worth referring to discussion in a deliberative process such as Professor Looney referred to.  The assessment debate, therefore, begins with questions concerning what the student needs to know on completion of upper second level, what the student should be able to do and how the student should \"be\" in terms of sense of self and as a member of the wider society.  The learning agenda, therefore, might be summarised as one concerned with knowing, one concerned with doing and one concerned with being.<\/p> <p>  It is true that the traditional upper second-level focus has greatly emphasised knowing, has placed much less emphasis on doing and has offered little on the issue of being.  This was reflected in, and reinforced by, the assessment approach, which relied largely on a written, terminal and summative exam that rewarded rote learning, cognitive intelligence, application to study and compliance.  This assessment approach has usually ignored the usually formative dimensions of the extracurricular, whether in sport, artistic pursuits such as drama and music, which can consume a school in its transition year activities, for example, or other social activism by the student, all of which provide immensely formative opportunities for those students who participate.  The fact that this activity is outside of the scope of assessment has meant that its potential contribution to realising the wider goals of the upper second-level experience has been greatly diminished.  <\/p> <p>  However, there are other problems with this approach to assessment.  The odds are stacked against poorer students and less well-resourced schools in this apparently fair process.  The appearance of fairness legitimates the outcomes; the winners feel they deserve their results and the losers likewise feel they got their just desserts so those who come out on top are under no obligation to reflect on the starting-out advantages they had in the academic race and those who come out on the bottom are unaware that they were hamstrung from the outset.  An intergenerational stasis emerges here where, even in a context of all boats rising, the small boats still stay small.  <\/p> <p>  This becomes all the more problematic when leaving certificate results are used as the basis for progression to higher education.  It is this role that now underpins the \"high-stakes\" nature of the leaving certificate - a characteristic it once had by virtue of the fact that most people finished their formal education at this point.  However, most people now progress to higher or further education, which means that the programme of study and outcomes there now become much more important in allocating employment and career opportunities displacing the leaving certificate role in this regard.  The points system, therefore, has a number of important implications for upper second level.  First, it means that the programme is conducted with one eye on third level such that the developmental needs of the child at this stage in their education are subordinated to the requirements of third-level entry.  Second, it crystallises the inequities that underpin second-level outcomes in third-level opportunities.  In this way, it reproduces existing categories of winners and losers from the parental generation and transforms inherited status into achieved status whether that is achieved success or achieved failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I must ask Professor Collins to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#F00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Finally, the better-off who fail to hit their desired points level are increasingly able to circumvent this hurdle.

It draws on my recent research report for the OECD on a comparative review of the Scottish senior secondary examinations.  Ireland was one of the assessment systems reviewed in this.<\/p> <p>  The value of a comparative approach is as a reminder that there are many ways to assess senior secondary students.  One of the problems of being embedded within a historic system is that we think that is the only way it can be done.  It is a case of \"you've got to do it this way\".  One of the key variables in this is the relative trust placed in teachers by society and the willingness of teachers to play a part in assessment.  Ireland is very distinctive in this respect in the lack of teacher contribution to senior secondary assessment in terms of certification.<\/p><p>As Dr. Looney pointed out, exam systems reflect the history and culture of the societies in which they occur.  When historically embedded, as the Irish system has been for a century, and where the English and Scottish systems have been going since the 19th century without much change in the architecture, they are difficult to change radically.  When parents and their parents have been through the same system, there is a resistance to change.<br\/><br\/>An educational system's curriculum may see more radical reform as it responds to social change, as we may have seen across the world.  Most changes reflect a broadening of the knowledge and skills that 21st century education requires.  As we speak, France, New Zealand and Norway are all introducing new curricula to address the wider range of skills now required.  We can change the curriculum but we find it much harder to change the assessment.  As more students continue in education, the senior secondary cohort becomes more diverse and requires a wider range of assessment approaches.  In many systems, including the Irish system, there is an increased role for vocational education.  In France, we have the <i>Baccalaur&eacute;at professionnel<\/i>, and in Norway, 50% of students take a vocational strand.<br\/><br\/>The Irish leaving certificate can be located within the British historical tradition, as opposed to the American, French and other traditions.  The emphasis in this is on national subject-based external examinations at 16 years and 18 years.  Most other cultures only examine at 18 years now.  The exam system is nationalised and central, and it is based on unseen papers which have not been pretested, which we can contrast with the more psychometric approaches such as that of America.  The system requires open-ended responses marked by trained examiners, and these are very distinctive to this British tradition.  Ireland is unique within this system for having fixed-grade boundaries, with grades always against a certain mark.  Elsewhere, these may shift according to the perceived difficulty of the paper.  However, this fixed boundary is not unusual in other systems, such as those of France and North America.<br\/><br\/>Teacher assessment contributing to the final grade plays a limited role in the British system or no role in Ireland&rsquo;s case, I understand.  In other systems it plays a central role, and in Norway 80% of the marks are determined by the teacher.  Even in the <i>Baccalaur&eacute;at professionnel<\/i>, the French teacher contributes with marks derived from continuous assessment.  Information technology currently plays a limited role in examinations yet offers the potential for broader and more imaginative assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Gordon Stobart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I ask Professor Stobart to conclude his remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#G00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Yes, I am just finishing.

It is hard to know where to start every week because all of us feel quite strongly about this matter.  As has been said, if the odds are stacked against the poorer students, one would feel like setting fire to the whole thing immediately.  Who wants it to stay as it is?  We cannot find anybody willing to come in front of the committee to tell us that this should remain absolutely unchanged, so I am trying to think who would such people be.  The grinds schools want the system to remain absolutely as it is because there is money to be made.  There are the schools that like to present themselves as being academically superior and high on school league tables.  There is an appalling journalistic insistence on throwing out completely untested data on schools; even the Department of Education does not like it and will not produce it under freedom of information.  So who is the system benefiting?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in what the witnesses said about teacher involvement and how it is more usual across Europe.  A number of years ago, we tried to change the junior certificate and there was massive resistance.  There was the use of terms like \"banning history\".  The leaving certificate does not just strangle young people; it also strangles subjects, as people who care about history might know.  My understanding is 54,000 students every year do junior certificate geography and history, 23,000 do leaving certificate geography but only 11,000 do leaving certificate history.  That is because students are afraid of the exam because it is a heavy and arduous written exam.<\/p> <p>  How do we get from where we are to what we want to achieve?  In all this, there is a scenario of certain schools not offering certain subjects at certain levels.  I gave statistics last week indicating there are 31 schools in the Republic of Ireland where no student does higher-level Irish for the leaving certificate and 39 schools where no student does higher level maths.  I may have my subjects mixed up but there are approximately 30 or 40 schools at second level where not a single student does honours or higher-level English, Irish or maths.  The process is stacked against poorer students.<\/p> <p>  With the assessed grades system over the past two years, we have learned that we can have proactive teacher involvement in assessment, with agreement.  It was not perfect and it was done as a firefighting measure because of the pandemic but surely within it there is potential for changing our mindset.  How do we learn from what has happened over the past two years and how do we make a difference now?  The witnesses are absolutely right in saying there is an intergenerational attachment to the exam because anybody from middle Ireland who has successfully negotiated second and third level feel there is nothing wrong because it was fine for them.  They want their children to be protected by the system that was successful for them.  If people have not been successful through it, they will not have as strong a voice.<\/p> <p>  How do we learn from the past two years and the matters raised by the assessed grades model, imperfect and all as it is?  Is this our one opportunity?  If we miss it, we may be another 20 or 30 years before we have this discussion again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#G00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises the fundamental question regarding how to bring about change.  I offer this as something to think about.  In 2017 there was the presentation of a notion that teachers are vehemently against being involved in the certification of their own students.  That idea was in the ether and we saw placards that spoke about fairness and so on.  People in newspaper articles argue that teachers abhor the notion of being involved.<\/p><p>I want to counter that by giving the committee some data from a piece of research we did in DCU.  We asked an agreement question based around \"strongly agree\" and so on.  It asked: \"As a result of having been involved in the calculated grades process in 2020, in my school I feel more positively disposed to being involved directly in assessing my students for certification purposes.\"  Of those surveyed, 30% of teachers agreed with that statement.  I do not believe those voices have been heard.  I do not hear them but they are there some place.<\/p><p> While I must add the caveat that this was a relatively small study of some 750 voluntary samples, there was a group of teachers who agreed with that statement.  Of the remainder, 62% of teachers disagreed with the statement and 9% were undecided.  If we add the undecided 9% to the 30% who agreed with the statement, we have a 60:40 split.  That 60:40 split was also the evident in the responses to the statement:  \"I believe that teachers' involvement in assessment for certification purposes would lead to fairer outcomes for the students in my school.\"  Perhaps the Deputy is referring to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Of the respondents, 36% agreed with that statement, 48% disagreed and 16% were undecided.<\/p><p> I just want to put those findings out there to show that it is not all negative.  We will, I hope, do a follow-up study on the accredited grades.  We want to check on those data because it was a surprise to me to find that one in three teachers were saying that this had changed their minds about being involved in certifying their own students.  I do not believe any teacher wants to be solely involved in that process - that is not what they are saying - but something certainly happened in 2020 and again in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>There is a basis for the beginning of a conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#H00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Yes, the beginning of a conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Does anyone else wish to comment on Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#H00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The real risk is that we will find a balance - as my colleague referred to - between the various trade-offs that must be made in all public examinations, agree on them and then move on.

Professor Stobart mentioned the cultural embeddedness and that we have an historical system that was borne out of the British system we inherited.  We can tweak around the edges and definitely improve it, but the fundamental issues that arise will not go away unless we have a bigger debate.  Even if we do add pieces of continuous assessment and modularisation, they will be colonised by people who will sell a deal to get students a better mark in the continuous assessment if they attend a two-day course for &euro;100.<\/p> <p>  We must address some of those issues and, as a society, say that this is not good enough for our children or our teachers because it puts them under undue pressure.

What was achieved by students in Ireland around examinations during Covid-19 is gaining international attention.  In other parts of the world students persuaded politicians to make changes.  For example, the question of whether school-related data could be counted in exams was quite a big issue in Scotland.  In Ireland, the mobilisation of students through the Irish Second-Level Students' Union and a student petition presented the Government with a clear alternative proposal around offering students a choice.  They got that and it was not tenable for that to be set back.  Students have tasted victory and know now that the student voice is not a token voice and they expect to be a voice at the table.  They showed that they were right and offered something positive to the system.<\/p> <p>  Students have an expectation this time that they will be active partners at the table when it comes to discussions about where we go.  They will expect their voice to be heard.  When we listen to students, they strongly promote the idea of an assessment system that matches 21st century learning needs.  It will be interesting to see whether that student voice is positioned as more conservative or more radical because students are not an homogenous group.  Nonetheless, they expect to be heard.  They are the new kid on the block.  That is what will be different this time.  We have the Irish Second-Level Students' Union.  To be fair, the Government has engaged quite strongly with students in those deliberative processes, which is important.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of political will, if we listen to the body politic, for the first time, post-Covid, people are talking about the knowing, being and doing balance that Professor Collins mentioned.  They are talking more about doing and being, as well as knowing.  UNESCO is talking about being, collaboration, solidarity and the ability to develop resilience.  All of these kinds of personal attributes are featuring much more significantly, even in how parents talk about their own children and how children and young people talk about themselves.  Those two aspects are very significant.  Most committee members, who are in leadership roles and are close to their communities, are picking that up also.

I just wanted to get that into the conversation.  I suspect that it would be very difficult for any democrat to argue that the students should not have some say in their own certification.  Students are well able to self-assess.  They would have to be given certain skills to self-assess better.  There are also areas of the curriculum, which Professor Collins highlighted, that involve those skills that are just not easily assessed through exams or even assignments.  I am thinking about things like collaborative problem solving and about how important that notion is.  \"Working with others\" is listed as a key skill.  The point I was trying to make in my submission is that teachers and students have a role to play here and that students should have some say.  I am not saying the students should give themselves a grade for working with others, but they certainly could be involved in determining what the grade will be by providing the evidence and having a debate with their teachers.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that groups of teachers, not single teachers, should make those decisions.  That would get away from the idea of a single teacher being responsible for the grade.  Certain skills in schools are cross-curricular.  The history teacher, the geography teacher, the maths teacher, the physics teacher, all the language teachers and all the science teachers see the students working with others and communicating.  Let us say a student is doing six subjects in the leaving certificate.  The teachers of those six subjects might sit down and make a collective judgment on that ability to work with others.  I am also saying that that has to count for something.  It cannot just be a token.  It has to count for progression to third level, where working with others is a key skill people look for.  I am not entirely sure about the exact detail of how this would play out but I wanted to present it as an idea for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

There are many stakeholders.  \"Trust\" is a word we are using a lot.  Another word I wish to use is \"fair\".  Fairness is very important.  The committee had a submission last week from people who spoke about areas of disadvantage where 26% or 27%, I believe, of students would go on to higher education.  I come from Ballinasloe, in east Galway and Roscommon, and from an area Pobal designates as deprived.  That means there are many single-parent families and many children there who may not go on to further and higher education for a myriad of different reasons.  Is the leaving certificate fair?  I have my own very strong opinions on that.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to hear that Professor O'Leary compiled the study to which he referred.  I am very happy to hear about the engagement of teachers.  I understand that the study involved a sample of about 750.

Would Professor O'Leary like to speak a little more about that accurate, consistent and fair decision-making in the process?  Could he point to one or two lessons we have learnt from accredited grades?<\/p> <p>  I thank Professor Stobart for his contribution.  I was very interested to hear about France, New Zealand and Norway introducing new curricula.  Professor Stobart talked about how we have to adapt to a digital future.  He talked also about the high numbers taking vocational courses in Norway and said that 80% of marks there and in France are determined by teachers.  How did Norway bring that system into place?  Here in Ireland we are trying to promote the apprenticeship programme and the opportunities for further and higher education.  We currently have a way lower bar in respect of apprenticeships.  We have 60 apprenticeship courses, with another 18 to come on stream.<\/p> <p>  I wish to pose a question to Professor Looney as well.

Why not take the best of what we have brought with us historically through the leaving certificate but also adapt it to make sure it is a fairer system and has the trust of everyone around us.

I go back to the point of us being embedded in a particular system.  Going back to Norway, it was the teachers who wrested the exam system from the universities back in the 19th century.  They wanted to be the centre of assessment.  That tradition has carried through, so they are central.  The related element is the vocational.  Again, that is traditional in that the introduction of exams in England in the 19th century came off the professional examinations.  Because written subjects and written exams were valued in the high-status professions, the education system took over and the vocational has always been treated as second fiddle to that.  There is the idea that if you can do it, you should do it through the academic route.  How we change that is an issue of making vocational tracks attractive and recognition in higher education and the like.  Ireland has gone a long way with that with the vocational programme, but the status of that is problematic.  If we can have apprenticeships and good destinations for vocational qualifications, that is well worthy of support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Gordon Stobart"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Stobart.

He is right.  What needs to be done regarding protecting the examination has all the trappings of fairness, but it looks very different to learners in Roscommon, for example, than it does to those in Rathmines or Rathgar.  It is not only the case because some students might enter the examination halls with some economic advantage, social capital or having had the benefit of grinds, it also involves all the messaging about consequences.  Some students have heard messaging about the consequences involved not just in the run-up to examinations, but since they were ten years old.  They have heard from their families and communities about what success and successful learning looks like and what kinds of learning we value as a society.  Therefore, the examination itself is fair, in its own narrow context, but the situation starts to look very different when we broaden our perspective.  To reiterate, it is not only about the messaging that happens on the way into the examination hall, but also the messaging which happens earlier in life.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the subject of specific trade-offs, it is a good question about what kind of balance we want to have.  We have high retention rates in upper secondary education.  Our students stay on until the end of the cycle.  This is part of our social imagination, in that we are really committed to education as a country.  It is probably our downfall in some ways, because taxi drivers and supermarket workers talk about what poetry questions came up in the leaving certificate examinations.  It is a national conversation.  We put a high value on education, therefore, but in senior cycle there are opportunities for more vocational education which would mean that we could move towards parity of esteem.  I have overheard conversations where parents have been advising their children not to study certain subjects because it is harder to get a certain mark or because a subject is not as well regarded.  Inevitably, those are the arts and vocational subjects, those subjects that students really enjoy and can engage with.  Regarding some of these trade-offs, then, I think we could get a better balance with some of these subjects if we had a better quality of conversation in this area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Looney"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Looney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#K00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I will allow Dr. Gleeson to come in and then we will move to the next member of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#K00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I concur with what has been said by Professor O'Leary and Dr. Looney, but we must be realistic about the limitations of examinations.

The standards are not published, which again highlights the complexity of this issue.  Questions underlie the use of attainment referencing, where the fundamental premise is that the issue is with the examination rather than the students.  That, however, ignores other possibilities, such as teaching practices in schools, for example, which could be influential.  Therefore, the issue here need not, necessarily, be the examination alone.  My last point is that our marking schemes are only published after the event and that, in turn, only leads to more teaching to the test the next year.

There are many questions I could ask.  Before I start, however, I looked up \"Promethean\" and it is probably no bad thing, because it refers to \"being rebelliously creative and innovative\".  Maybe it was the end that Prometheus came to that was on my mind earlier.<\/p> <p>  However, there is possibly something rebellious, creative and innovative about the suggestion that students could be involved in assessment.  I would like to know what the other witnesses think about that proposal.  At one level, it seems to make a great deal of sense because part of teaching people to understand would surely involve helping them to assess that aspect, including looking at concepts such as objectivity, checking for bias etc.  We do, however, rub up against human nature in these situations as well.  People are inclined to seek to advantage for themselves, inevitably.  The question then is whether the suggestion put forward is doable.  The proposer believes it is, and I will be interested to hear whether the other witnesses think it is necessary and possible.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect that I would like to ask the witnesses about, and I am happy to throw it open for whomever wishes to take this point up, is whether one of the biggest issues, if not the biggest issue, in this regard is that third level colleges are burdening the second level education system with the task of preparing people for CAO selection.  Do the third level institutions not have enough resources themselves to undertake that job and should they not be tasked with doing it?  That could include, if necessary, even postponing the beginning of the first academic year until the following new year.  Does it not seem obvious, when we think of the amount of money that people spend on going to college and the amount of money the State spends funding them, that the least we would expect would be that people would have to be interviewed and assessed to see if they are suitable for the courses they are applying for?  Would doing that not free up energies and possibilities for the leaving certificate examinations?<\/p> <p>  The whole narrative that we have been hearing today has been about the system being broken.  I do not necessarily disagree with that perspective but again I wonder, to some degree, if we are dealing with the inevitable reality of human affairs.  Is a perfect system possible?  Are we demonstrably worse than all other countries in this regard?  Is it just that we have problems that we must solve in this area, just as those other countries have problems they need to solve as well?<\/p> <p>  Turning to what Professor Hyland, in particular, mentioned regarding the NCCA's reform of syllabuses, I gather there is a particular concern in the area of science, such as in physics, chemistry and biology.  Mention was also made of Irish and agricultural science.  What I have heard from people involved is that experts in teaching and the science people in the universities and at second level are pointing out problems with a vague prescription of learning outcomes, but that the NCCA is moving on regardless.  Why is this happening?  How does that situation connect with the agenda that we are here to discuss?  Is this a problem connected with the problem we are talking about, which is enhancing student accomplishments and the outcomes in their lives?  I thank the witnesses, and I am sorry that it is a long list of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#K00700","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I call Professor Hyland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#K00800","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I am happy to come in on those questions.  On the question of students self-assessing, they do it already in the primary schools.  Anyone here who has children or grandchildren at that level, will know that the primary schools always ask them to self-assess.  It is on the report card and I always read it with interest.  How that kind of assessment would be incorporated would be different beyond that level.  I have used that method in group work at third level.  It is tricky to do, and not easy to incorporate into a final mark.  It can be done, though, where there are smallish groups and it is possible to engage with them.  It would, though, be more difficult to do it in a national public examination.<\/p> <p>  Turning to third level education, I chaired the points commission and 22 years ago we made a recommendation, very similar to what Senator Mullen suggested, that there should be much less granularisation in first year.  In other words, the suggestion was that students should apply in a more macro sense to macro courses.  If that happened, the points would not be as they are now, in the sense of being so competitive.  I do not want to go into explaining that aspect, but that recommendation was made 22 years ago.  It was not picked up.  It is for the higher education institutions themselves to decide on entry under legislation, of course.  It is not a matter for the Government, surprising as that might seem.  Under the Universities Act 1997, decisions on selection are entirely a matter for the higher education institutions.  <\/p> <p>  I come from the generation where matriculation examinations were run by the National University of Ireland, NUI, and Trinity College Dublin, TCD.  I would hate to go back to that situation because it meant that leaving certificate students then had to prepare themselves for three separate examinations: the leaving certificate, NUI matriculation and TCD matriculation.  To be honest, the NUI and TCD matriculation examinations were totally arbitrary.  There were no syllabuses and the professors used whatever they wanted.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I imagine there was nothing about interviews either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#L00100","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Exactly.  I am afraid that interviews would disadvantage those who are already disadvantaged much more.  The points commission report from 1999, which is a long time ago, addressed many of those issues in detail and looked at the positives and negatives.  There was also widespread consultation.  As Professor Looney mentioned, Ireland was not ready for change at that time.  Nor was it ready in 2005 when Professor Looney came up with her proposals for a revised leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  There is no perfect system.  Ireland differs from some other countries because education has always been so high on the agenda and it has always been a social lifter.  Most of us would came from rural and small farm backgrounds two or three generations ago, and over the generations the leaving certificate and education generally were what brought us to where we are.  Whether that is good or bad, that is how it is perceived and that is why Irish people have such a respect for the education system and the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  I am equally puzzled as to why the NCCA is going ahead with revising syllabi while the Minister is looking at the proposals of the NCCA for an overall reform of senior cycle education.  It may well be that the Minister and all of the decision makers, including those on the committee, will decide that there should be a better balance between the vocational and the academic, which we do not have.  There are a lot of decisions implicit in the review and reform of senior cycle education.  The NCCA should hold back.  I am impressed by the teachers in subject associations.  They have no other agenda and are willing to embrace change, but they do not know that there is little or no content in these new specifications.  They are almost without content and there is no information on how they will be assessed.  I am fully supportive of the Irish Science Teachers Association, the Irish Agricultural Science Teachers Association and the 12 different Irish language groups that are engaging in the consultation process on the revision of senior cycle Irish.  Their concerns need to be listened to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>On the Senator's first question, it is useful to distinguish between formative and summative assessment.  It is highly desirable that children, right up to leaving certificate level, would self-assess and peer-assess.  Feedback from peers is a key part of the formative processes of assessment.  Even learning how to manage feedback is itself an important part of that process.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked a question about third level education which I addressed in my opening statement.  Third level entry overwhelms second level and the senior cycle.  I will go back to the earlier question of whether the process is fair.  It is conducted fairly but we need to distinguish between the fair management of a process, on the one hand, and the outcomes, on the other.  If we can predict the outcomes years before the examinations happen, which we can on the basis of socioeconomic background, then we know that the outcomes are not fair.  That assumes a huge significance if those outcomes determine entry into third level education.  It is not just gaining access that is at issue; it is also about gaining access to prestige courses, high earning programmes and the most desirable professional opportunities.  For instance, if second level examination outcome is determining those routes, it means that entire geographic areas may well be disproportionately denied access to professions like medicine, law and veterinary.  Entry into these professions is highly competitive but if the D&aacute;il constituencies were to be reviewed and if it was found that the proportion of those doing medicine varied significantly from one constituency to another based on the socioeconomic structure of that constituency, then the Senator is answering his own question as to whether it is fair.<\/p> <p>  We need to find a different method for third level entry other than the second level exam.  If we do not find that different method, then the possibilities for change in upper second level education and for change to the exam become hugely constrained.  Michael Sandel, a professor of philosophy at Harvard University, wrote about this recently.  He favours the notion of a lottery because he says that every other system will be gamed by the better off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I have to stop Professor Collins there and bring in Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#L00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I wonder if Prometheus is the wrong person from Greek mythology to mention or if are we more like Sisyphus rolling the rock up the hill again.  Camus said \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy\", so let us undertake that with gusto.  I found the presentations extremely informative.  I wish the format was looser because there were so many points at which I would have liked to stop the witnesses and have asked them to explain particular points but the number of people involved would not allow that.  I am particularly struck by Professor Looney's idea of a social imaginary.  I was thinking back to when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, appeared on the \"Late Late Show\" when he was Taoiseach during one of the first Covid lockdowns.  There was moral panic when he took a piece of paper from his pocket because our social imaginary is that we must know these things by rote.  The idea is that you answer a question on Shakespeare but if the quote is not in your head you are not allowed to look at the text.  That is a bizarre thing to ask a person to do.  What kind of a measure is that?  There is also a social imaginary that we have a meritocracy whereas in fact it is as Professor Collins said; it crystallises inequalities.  Even though it is fair in some senses, it is not fair in so many other senses.<\/p> <p>  There are a huge number of things I would like to unpack but time will not allow me to do so.  In the broadest sense, I wonder if we should look at the idea of splitting the summative part of the leaving certificate, if indeed it is summative because I think it only effectively quantifies that knowing element and that it does not touch the sides of either doing or being, and the matriculation element of it.  Those are two separate purposes and we concentrate unduly on the matriculation element and it becomes extremely competitive.  In medicine, veterinary or whatever else you need to be at a minimum standard in your academic capabilities but that may not be the best determinant of what kind of a doctor you will be, for example.  We have all met doctors who might have been good with the scalpel but not fantastic in terms of their bedside manner, for example.  On the other side of the coin, there are courses, which might not be as highly trafficked, for which the points intake is lower than the level of academic achievement that would be appropriate for the course.<\/p> <p>  If we decoupled the summative and matriculation elements, would we be able to state what the minimum academic standard is and that we would look at a students' other abilities in the meantime?  For example, we could look at students' ability to engage in group work or to problem solve using social skills, which is incredibly important in a range of professions.  Would that allow teachers to contribute in a better way?  One of the things suggested in Professor O'Leary's paper was that there could be a senior certificate.  Perhaps there could be a teachers' assessment in that.  On the train up to Dublin, I was reading about a toolmaker and the idea of the person who is gifted with his or her hands and who is thinking about things in a particular way.<\/p><p>I am not sure how that could be measured in the leaving certificate, whereas a teacher could tell you the student is a toolmaker and will be exceptional at it.  I do not know if I have asked a question yet.<\/p><p> I want to give Professor Stobart the opportunity to expand on something he mentioned in his opening statement.  In one sentence he stated that Ireland is very distinctive in terms of not involving teachers in the assessment process.  I want to afford him the opportunity to expand on that, because he wants to free us a little from our own context.  That would be welcome.  I ask the other witnesses to comment on the idea of decoupling the summative from the matriculation element.<\/p><p> I also want to give Professor Hyland the opportunity to expand on the idea of modularisation with a view to moving towards continuous assessment across the two-year cycle.

They are on the side of the students and want to teach their students, but they feel somebody else should examine them.  I wonder if that needs some more investigation, partly because the teachers may then go off and examine other people's children.  The notion that we separate teaching from assessment in that way may need some more investigation.  Most cultures see a place for allowing teachers to make judgments.  I think that feeds into that matriculation decoupling.  If you have, as we do as part of the historic tradition, single subject examinations, it is very hard to introduce ideas like self-assessment or group contribution.  Other systems have a much wider range.  They are not reliant on single subject exams.  The International Baccalaureate is one such example.  There is a component of that that is about creativity, activity and service.  It allows contributions in those areas to contribute to the certificate at the end.  The same is true in the American system.  You do not get into university simply on the basis of your points.  You have to put in a lot more about your contributions, what you have done elsewhere, your teacher report and your grade point average from continuous assessment.  That idea of broadening what is required to move on to tertiary education and the like allows these wider key skills to be brought into play.

That is why I am disappointed the NCCA did not look at anything that was different.  A certain approach was assumed and it is beginning to revise all of the syllabi along an assumed traditional approach.  There has been no thinking outside of the box and trying to think of a new way of doing it.  We had to do it in the university sector as part of the Bologna process.  I was very involved in training the teachers in my own university in Cork over the past 20 years in revising the syllabi to ensure they were modularised and semesterised.  It was an extraordinarily positive experience in which we all had to look at our own work, what we were teaching, how we would reorganise the courses into six- or 12-week modules and examine them at the end.<\/p> <p>  One would do the same thing with the leaving certificate.  In some of the subjects, it would work; in some subjects, it might be more difficult.  However, many of the subjects would, in fact, lend themselves to that.

I am assuming a lot of that marking would be done externally.  I take the point Professor Stobart has made, but as I said, I have worked in the system for forty-odd years.  I have waited to see if the teachers would change their attitude.  I was one of the first members of the curriculum examiner board 40 years ago.  We were all in favour of having the teachers assess their own students for certification.  It has not happened.  I am much more pragmatic at this stage.

I had to step out, but I was listening in my office.  I thank them for their contributions.  First, to Professor Collins, the argument about the education system is that its very function is to maintain social order and to control the social order.  This offers us the opportunity to look at what social order we want and, therefore, what part education plays in that.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  I have guest lectured in pedagogy for several years.  I see the students who come out of school and the narrow-mindedness of some of them.  Others really want to explore things.  The education system has worked for some, but the people on either margin are the ones who suffer.  I told the Minister, Deputy Harris, last week that I do not think it is only about vocational skills and apprenticeships.  I strongly feel people who are very gifted academically are also fundamentally failed by the system.  That must be addressed.  It is too easy to look at this as a question of developing apprenticeships or developing an education system around what our economy needs.  That is not what education should be about; it should be about thinking.  I enjoyed what Dr. Gleeson said about knowing, doing and being, from that perspective, because we do not know what the future holds.<\/p> <p>  A few questions came up about what others are doing and whether there is anything better out there.  If COP26 has taught us anything, it is not to look at the lowest common denominator.  We now have a chance.  The programme for Government provides for a citizens' assembly on education.  This committee, the NCCA - faults and all that I recognise - and the Department are all doing work.  There is a moment now where we could leap forward.  We could be leaders and we could look at all of the problems.  As Professor Looney has stated, when you think about the context we are in at the moment and the massive challenges nobody predicted, now is the opportunity to make these massive changes.<\/p> <p>  Professors Stobart and Hyland both made an interesting point on the willingness of teachers to move ahead with a different way of doing things.  We have seen, during the pandemic, how the leaving certificate has changed.  Students changed it, if you ask me.  They had not done that before.  There was a certain amount of that kind of difference in approach to assessment.  Perhaps there is an opportunity there that we have not seen for the past 40 years.<\/p><p>We should not forget that by being overly practical.  While all of us, as thinkers and policymakers, want to be practical and have a practical route, we might also want a quite imaginative route.  Those are my few thoughts on the matter.  We are now having a fairly broad discussion.  I would welcome further thoughts from the delegates.  I have been very concerned about siloing generally since I entered politics.  While I am concerned about different Departments doing different things, I believe the amount of siloing within one Department is incredible, as is evident when we look at the work of the NCCA.  As has been pointed out, that its work is being done at the same time as the kind of work we are doing makes absolutely no sense.  How can we be persuasive?  Since everything the delegates are saying will go on the record, how can they persuade people that it is critical that we break down the barriers, remove the opaqueness, stop infantilising individuals who are almost adults, regard teaching as mentorship rather than instruction, and assess what adults have managed to instruct almost-adults on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#M00700","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am happy that Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the issue of high achievers.

On high achievers, the Senator has raised a really interesting point.<\/p> <p>  In the Centre for Assessment Research, Policy and Practice in Education, CARPE, in DCU, we carried out research in which we examined some of the reasons why Ireland, in studies such as PISA, is listed as having a lower proportion of students at the highest level of achievement than other countries that, on average, achieve the same as Ireland.  We have fewer people than are predicted for us at the highest level of achievement.  Part of the story comprises what we do with our 15-year-olds in school, the tasks and the nature of the learning we ask them to engage in.  These are difficult to disentangle but I strongly suspect that what we do at the end of post-primary education has a big impact, even at 15 years of age, on not getting high achievers to the point where they should be.

The Senator mentioned the full continuum of achievement and ability in an inclusive system.  An aspiration of our system is to be more inclusive.<\/p> <p>  Let me outline something of note in thinking about the transition from second level to higher education.  Apropos of something Senator Mullen said, I work in the higher education space and, as such, am programmed to say we do not have enough resources to do everything we need to do; however, the emergence in Ireland of the tertiary sector, the changes coming in further education and training, the emergence of the new technological universities, and some changes in the way universities are working, driven by the human capital initiative, mean there is quite a shake-up in the range of offerings in tertiary education and pathways into it.  DCU is home to Ireland's largest access programme and it also has students who enter through further education and training programmes and based on mature-entry criteria.  We focus so much on the race for a small number of programmes in one or two institutions that get coverage in one or two newspapers that people believe there is a race.  The vast majority of students get the course they want or list as second.  They are very happy and do not end up changing.  I include the cohort who did not do a leaving certificate examination, in respect of whom we are led to believe the world will stop revolving.  Their first-year examination results were pretty much the same as they would have got had they done the leaving certificate examinations.  Therefore, there are changes happening here that would give me cause for optimism.<\/p> <p>  Our system is the subject of considerable international interest.  We are inundated with educational tourists who want to know how we are doing so much so well, why our students stay in the system and why they are broadly happy with it.  In all of the conversations, the educational tourists end up scratching their heads over the leaving certificate examination.  Although they say we are doing so much to work with students and change our system regarding inclusiveness and that we have a high-quality teaching profession, they end up almost aghast at the leaving certificate examination, as if to ask why we have not managed to address it yet.  I am certainly with the Senator in asking whether this is the time for breaking down some silos and leading on it.

Some of the assessment requirements are so tied in to such high stakes, that being access to third level.

While it may be true that the competitive element only applies in some sectors of higher education, we should not underestimate the importance of the formation of ambition, which begins when a child is very young.

I am more concerned to see something happening rather having what I have seen over the past 40 years or so.<\/p> <p>  I would have some concerns about a full decoupling of the leaving certificate from higher education.  I have experience of the University of California system as I have two grandchildren in that university.  They had to submit 14 separate pieces of evidence in their applications.  We talk about stress but the leaving certificate is nothing compared to that.  They had to submit all kinds of things like a video of their last football match or a tape recording of a music performance.  There are so many pieces being taken into account.  It is well-intentioned as it is an attempt to see the full child in a holistic way but it is very stressful for the students and totally difficult for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  That is my reservation.<\/p> <p>  At the time of the points commission there were a group of us who fully favoured what has been mentioned here today, namely, the lottery system.  In other words, students would need to meet a certain minimum requirement for the programme that they are applying for and then all those names would go into a hat and there would be a lottery.  We got no national or political support for that idea.  The national lottery system did not wash.  There is a section about it in that report because it would solve many of the problems we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  As many of us have mentioned, there are really only a relatively small number of courses in third level that are driving the stress and are the high points courses, as they are now referred to.  We looked at that and made suggestions that some of those could become graduate courses, rather than undergraduate courses, as is the case in some other countries.  For example, that could apply to medicine and law and so on and all the students would go into a much more generic first year courses.  We would then be close enough to the French system.  However, the French system is a bit different because they have selection at the end of first and second year.  The question is whether we are happy that our professors, who may have a vested interest, are selecting at that point.  There is another issue there.

I have mentioned here the fact that under the new proposals from the national council there would be a distinction between schools - it is not clear whether it is schools or students but let us say it is schools - which are call L1 schools, in other words, schools teaching through the medium of Irish, such as Gaeltacht schools and other schools, and that there will be two separate syllabi, each at ordinary and higher level, in other words, there will be four new syllabi, but that the current foundation level programme will be abolished.  That is a source of great concern for Irish teachers because the foundation level programme has been a very important programme for those who are not the high achievers - not the students we are concerned about when we are talking about higher education entry.  At the other end of the spectrum, the concern is that in some Gaeltacht schools, for example, if they were required to teach the L1 curriculum, the higher curriculum, some of their students might not be able for it and that there would be problems there.  The Irish language teachers, both those in Gaeltacht and Gaelscoileanna, are concerned, and the teachers in non-Irish language schools are concerned as well.<br\/><br\/>The proposal that we have suggested back to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is that it look again at the whole structure of what it is proposing, do not tie it necessarily into L1 and L2 schools, bring back the foundation course but add a fourth level or what we would call &quot;the s&aacute;rleibh&eacute;al&quot; - the highest, higher than the higher level.  That would be one option.  Alternatively, we suggest it have a separate, much more advanced subject.  We have talked earlier here today about the high achievers and those who have very high ambitions in a subject.  There are a number of proposals being put forward by the Irish language groups.  Unusually, all 12 organisations have come together.  Because I come from an Irish-speaking background, I was working with them on this.  We came up with this suggestion and they have all agreed to it.

The other concern I would have is that almost 50% of children and young people from backgrounds that are disadvantaged do not attend DEIS schools.<\/p> <p>  DEIS schools are very much in clusters.  As the Deputy will be aware, one will have a school that will get the designation because it has X% of students above a certain level who are coming from socially-disadvantaged backgrounds.  Apart from that there are individual students, possibly, for example, Traveller children, who are not close to a designated DEIS school and are attending ordinary non-designated schools.  There are no additional resources as such available for them.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is they often miss out on some of the special access programmes that are additionally funded in higher education.  Many of the access programmes are targeted specifically to DEIS schools, which is a good thing, but then young people who are from disadvantaged backgrounds but are not in a DEIS school are not eligible for some of those.

We have to look separately at them.  To some extent, some of the new access programmes have done that.  For example, in UCC, which is the one I am familiar with, up to 15% of our places, and on some courses 25% of places, are set aside for early school leavers or students who have not done the leaving certificate, much less done well enough in the leaving certificate.  They can bypass the CAO system.  That is why I emphasised at the beginning that it is a matter for each university.  They have the freedom to do that, for example, the programme that qualified Don O'Leary, that is, the youth and community work programme in UCC.  Maynooth had something similar.  Some 50% of the places on that programme were allocated for students who did not get the points in the leaving certificate.  They either were early school leavers or mature students, or they had come through further education courses.  There is much potential flexibility in the higher education system if they would use it to its full advantage.  I do not know if that helps.<\/p> <p>  In fact, as Professor Looney stated earlier, on a lot of these issues it is worth looking at what is happening already.  There is a lot happening already, sometimes on a small scale and sometimes not in the very competitive courses.  Where we would have, say, 50% of places in youth and community available, there might be only 5% in medicine because it is difficult to get them to agree, for various reasons, to give more of their places.<\/p> <p>  Some of that has been going on for a long time but it is happening more and more now.  Overall, between all the various categories of students, for example, students with special needs, students from educational disadvantage and students coming from further education, I reckon that approximately 20% of all higher education places are going to those students.  Possibly, only 70% or so of all first-year places, or maybe even less, are available through the CAO.  It varies a lot and there is a lot of flexibility there if institutions want to use it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#P01200","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Looney to comment on my original question and also the next one.

We frighten the bejesus out of an awful lot of students in the two months leading to the leaving certificate.  From the minute they get up in the morning they are exposed to it.  When they come home in the evening it is on the radio.  It is in the print media and social media.  It is everywhere.  On the introduction of continuous assessment, as I said to Professor Hyland a significant number of students do not have confidence.  They can come from the most well-off of backgrounds.  Due to that lack of confidence, their real potential is not realised.  It is caused by the cultural obsession, the points race in the CAO and issues likes that.  It is a mad, crazy situation.

What is the role of assessment in helping them to connect?  Certainly, it is within assessment processes that give students multiple opportunities to achieve such as if students were told that their piece of work would count towards their exam and that they would have three attempts at it.  On their first attempt, they would receive feedback and then they could work on it again and again.  That could build a student's confidence rather than the once-off exam in a clinical hall where they get a result but do not understand how they got it.  That could be a positive motivator for students.<\/p> <p>  In the context of where we now live, as I said earlier there is a risk that in introducing continuous assessment, each one could become like a mini examination.  Just as the teacher is sitting down with a student providing feedback, someone else is doing a Saturday course offered by a company.  We would have to deal with the cultural obsession issues.  I certainly believe it would be more motivating.  If one wants a sense of the cultural obsession - with due respect to my colleague, Professor Hyland, and Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - one can consider the conversation about Irish.  At the same time, we are talking about the cultural obsession, we think a way to promote Irish is to tell some students that there are four levels of Irish and they will be doing the bottom level.  I guarantee that the kids who will be doing the bottom level will be the kids the Chairman are talking about.  Therefore, the whole philosophy of a common level and a wider pathway at junior cycle was about not messaging and not putting students in boxes too early and giving them multiple opportunities to succeed.  Equally, the issuing of bonus points is a very blunt instrument.  Our cultural obsession is to reward the ones who work really hard and do higher level and give them a few bonus points because that is our currency for success.  Changing our mode of assessment can change the way we engage with students around assessment.  I am not preparing them for the test; I am working with them to help them achieve in a piece of continuous assessment.  That could be a big motivator.  A distracting argument people often make is that students will do the project at home and that will obviously involve bringing in some social capital.  It needs to be an in-classroom discussion with learners.  It needs to happen in schools.  There are some really good examples of that happening in schools already but teachers feel they have to stop doing them when they enter the examination season.  Therefore, it is a question of how do we strike that balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Looney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I want to make two quick points.

Not that many students do it but it speaks to a lot of what we are talking about in terms of reform.  The second point is there is some anecdotal evidence from the involvement of teachers in certifying their own students from 2020 that a higher percentage of students from disadvantaged schools progressed into higher education.  A couple of really good examples of that were picked up by the press.  People said that they graduated 70% of their students into further and higher education for the first time in their history.

There is a large number of people doing transition year and there is a significant amount of positivity about it.  An awful lot of students call it \"the doss year\" but I think it is far from a doss year because they learn a huge amount of common sense during it.  If one wants to learn common sense, that is the year in which to learn it.  Students go on work placement and gain experience and there is a huge amount they can learn in those 12 months.  If we are to have leaving certificate reform and to have some form of continuous assessment - although I do not believe it is the be all and end all either - can we work the transition year into a final year assessment?

It was formerly a problem - I am not sure of the current figures - that disadvantaged children were less likely to do it than the better-off children.  Notwithstanding that, a lot of the work has been done on transition year.  Dr. Gerry Jeffers, in Maynooth, for instance has done a major evaluation and has given a positive assessment of it.  The risk with tying it into the leaving certificate is that it would kill all of that.  That is the real risk to the possibilities for creativity and wandering outside of narrow instrumental purposes.  If that is assessed, unless it is through the formative method we talked about earlier, it might change the character of the programme somewhat.  I am interested in the concept of portfolios.  Students can come out of transition year with a portfolio of achievement.  That is something they can take with them to various places and is something they can look back on as a composite statement about themselves.  I do not at all doubt the educational value of what the programme is doing.  If it is used for summative assessment in the way we have approached summative assessment to date, I would be afraid that the entire aesthetic of the programme would be sacrificed in the context of the assessment protocols.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I agree with much of what Professor Collins has said.

Having said that, many schools have domesticated transition year to a state where it is not recognisable as against what it was originally intended, and that is the nature of things.  Arguably, the same situation has happened with the leaving certificate applied.  My fundamental answer to the Deputy's question is that both transition year and the leaving certificate applied, LCA, in different ways, share a very different culture to the traditional leaving certificate establishment culture that Dr. Anne Looney and others have been talking about.  We need to be very careful about interfering with those cultures because we could end up the poorer for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jim Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>In the context of the breadth of subjects available in the leaving certificate, does Professor Stobart consider there to be too many subjects available to students in the Irish system?

On the Irish language, my personal opinion is that until the Minister gives us her views and decisions on the NCCA report on the overall reform of senior cycle, which I assume will look at leaving certificate applied and so on, the individual syllabi should be changed.  There will be major changes.  I suggest that the NCCA freeze everything and hold back until it knows.  Given what we have heard this morning, we might be optimistic that there may be some very exciting - I do not want to use the word radical - change.  In that context, we might be looking at subjects in quite a different way.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mullen raised a point about competitiveness.  Industry is represented on some of the NCCA committees, so its voice is heard.  Some of the skills in the framework for senior cycle, with which the Senator may be familiar, take account of the voice of industry.  We must keep reminding ourselves when people are critical about undue rote learning and so on that international employers are satisfied that the Irish people whom they recruit, both locally and internationally, do in fact have many of the skills and competitiveness that industry needs.  Young people are quite competitive.  While some may find the leaving certificate quite stressful, others quite enjoy the element of competition that is engaged.  It is a very difficult balance and I take the point on how to satisfy everyone across the spectrum.<\/p> <p>  On the lottery, I do not know what there is halfway.  We could be at a point of change now.  The universities and higher education institutions can choose to have some courses chosen by lottery and others not chosen that way.  Much of it is a case of logistics.  The sheer numbers coming through, 60,000 annually, means that adding something extra is a challenge.  The CAO is done entirely by computer.  There is no personal intervention between the marks and the places that are offered.  Much of what we have discussed this morning would require personal intervention which, with 60,000 new entrants, is quite difficult.  I know from interviewing in the very long distant past when we interviewed all students applying for teacher education that it was hugely demanding on time.

It is interesting to see the discourse around what companies, industry and employers need now coalesce so much with what we talk about in education, namely, resilience, inclusiveness and creativity being as important as the ability to handle advanced calculus and algebra.  There is very much a shared agenda in that regard and that is useful.  There is also strong industrial support in Ireland for keeping a wide range of subjects for leaving certificate and keeping that breadth.  That is seen as one of our advantages.  We are one of the few systems where every student studies mathematics until the end of schooling.  That is really important.  <\/p> <p>  I was thinking about Senator O'Reilly's point about the lottery.  I am intrigued by the idea of a qualifying point and that there would be a threshold of points, which would be the qualifications Professor O'Leary indicated we know are needed to succeed, for example, verbal skills, mathematics, etc., and that there could be a blended system where someone might reach a threshold and then enter a lottery for places.

If that role were removed, how would a leaving certificate exam stand in the public imagination and the significance it holds for the curricular experience in second level?  Competitiveness is best served by maximising a successful outcome and successful encounter with school in the general population.  We know that most children are happy in school at second level but about 25% are not.  That 25% is predominantly working class.  Male working class students in particular present a particular challenge.  Subgroups such as Travellers, which Senator O'Reilly mentioned, are massively disadvantaged within the sector.<\/p> <p>  It is useful to think less of disadvantaged areas - around DEIS - than to think of disadvantaged people.<\/p><p>However, it is always difficult to target disadvantaged people.<\/p><p> My final point is that reform in education drips slowly.  It is very difficult.  We were asked earlier who the winners are who are managing to block it.  There are many winning in different ways under the current system, and the combination of those winners will probably make reform difficult, slow and painful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#S00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Will Professor Stobart make a final comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021111600002#T00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>To be brief, I say \"Amen\" to everything Professor Collins has said.

I will provide an overview of ONE and discuss its strategic plan and goals, in particular in the context of veterans' policy.  We will be happy to take questions at the end of the presentation.<br\/><br\/>The organisation was founded in 1951, in the aftermath of the major demobilisation following the Emergency - Second World War.  That demobilisation had a great effect on veterans, leaving many of them homeless and in dire circumstances.  The organisation transitioned in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when veterans were found dead on the streets of Dublin.  The organisation, like IUNVA, believed that should not happen and that these people should be supported, and transitioned the organisation into the charity it is today.  We opened our first home, in Queen Street, Dublin, in 1994 and replaced that home and added two more in 2005 and 2006.  In 2007, we signed a service level agreement with the Department of Defence which, as I have often said, was not important for what was in it but because we now had a service level agreement with the Department.  It gave the organisation official recognition.<br\/><br\/>In 2012, we opened our first veterans support centres, which can be simply explained as a cross between an advice centre and a men's or women's shed.  They are somewhere to go for a cup of tea or, equally, to organise a bed for the night and so on.  The 2015 White Paper on Defence included an embryonic veterans' policy.  We, IUNVA, ARCO and the other associations welcomed that but stressed it was embryonic.  Over the past three years, we have developed a nationwide network of these veterans support, drop-in centres.  Senator Craughwell visited one we opened at Cathal Brugha Barracks the week before last.  These veterans support centres were contained in the programme for Government of June 2020 and we welcomed that.  This year and for the next two years, we are expanding our homelessness capacity nationwide to 60 bedrooms.<br\/><br\/>Today, ONE has 37 branches, 15 veterans support centres and four homes operating, namely: Br&uacute; Chost&uacute;im, Athlone, which has seven bedrooms; the recently opened Br&uacute; na Farraige, Cobh, which has five bedrooms and is receiving the final touches; Br&uacute; na bhFiann, Dublin, our flagship home, which has 35 bedrooms; and Br&uacute; Doire Fe&aacute;, Letterkenny, with seven bedrooms.  We are planning our Cork city branch in co-operation with Cork City Council and will have another meeting with the council next week.  That will give us an additional six bedrooms, bringing the totality to 60 bedrooms nationwide.<br\/><br\/>Veterans support officers have been in place for the past year and a half to two years.  They are counsellors, for want of a better term.  In head office, they work in partnership with the Leopardstown Park Hospital Trust, one of our charity partners.  As members will be aware, the trust was founded initially to look after veterans of the British army but now also supports veterans of the Defence Forces.  At Br&uacute; na bhFiann, we have a full-time counsellor in partnership with the HSE Dublin north community healthcare area and are under discussions - we had a meeting two weeks ago - with the Cork-Kerry community healthcare area to provide a further counsellor in Cork city.  In the greater Cork-Kerry area, there are five branches, two veterans support areas and two houses, and one counsellor covers all of that.<br\/><br\/>We also hold monthly medical clinics.  Deputy Berry, who is a doctor, provides the multi-medical clinic on a voluntary basis in Dublin and another veteran provides a monthly medical clinic at our house in Athlone.  We have about 1,000 members and about 2,100 supporters donate annually.  We have a new website at <i>one-veterans.org<\/i>.  Prior to the opening of the new house in Cork next year or the year after that, we have 54 beds, or about 20,000 bed nights every year.  We have kept about 1,000 veterans safely off the streets and about 90% of those veterans progress to permanent accommodation.<br\/><br\/>If members remember nothing else from this briefing, I ask them to remember four words, namely, support, comradeship, advocacy and remembrance, because that is what ONE does.  On support, members will see the mission statement on the slide, which is registered with the Charities Regulator and is stated in our constitution and our handbook of rules.  It relates to providing accommodation through the houses and other supports through our veteran support centres and our branches.<br\/><br\/>On comradeship, I often say civilians have colleagues, whereas members of the Defence Forces have comrades.  That comradeship comes from a shared experience, a shared set of values and a willingness to serve.  Advocacy relates in part to what we are doing at this meeting, while remembrance includes events such as the Niemba anniversary at Cathal Brugha Barracks last week.<br\/><br\/>If that is the mission, the values, which I do not think will be a stranger to any committee members, comprise commitment, compassion, comradeship, honesty, respect and, principally, service to others.  That relates to helping fellow veterans who may be less fortunate, with no expectation of anything in return.<br\/><br\/>Strategy is all about means, ways and ends.  The ends are the mission and values I just mentioned.  The means include everything, such as ONE and other veterans' associations but Oireachtas committees such as this one as well.  Finally, the ways are our eight strategic goals, which are wrapped around the veteran.  Governance is first and foremost because in a charity, as members will well know as they have all been involved in charities, if the governance aspect is not done right, the rest will collapse.  The other strategic goals comprise: support and awareness; a viable veterans' policy; financial stability; strengthening the organisation; the veterans support centres and the hospital network I mentioned; and a diversity and inclusion policy.  We deliberately included the inclusion policy because there is sometimes a perception veterans' organisations are just for old men, and we as veterans' organisations need to change that and are addressing that actively.  Veterans today leave the Defence Forces earlier than in the past, so we have to look after that coterie of veterans as well as the older veterans and those people who get into trouble.<br\/><br\/>I will now concentrate on one of the goals, that is, the veterans' policy.  It seeks, in union with the other veterans' organisations and the Government, to ensure the continued development of a viable and sustainable Government veterans' policy.  We define the veterans' policy as the declaration of the Government's political activities, plans and intentions relating to veterans of the Defence Forces.  We believe veterans' policy requires a whole-of-government approach because many of the issues affecting veterans, such as housing and healthcare, do not fall within the remit of the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces.  We have three priority areas in the veterans' policy domain, that is, the creation of an office of veterans affairs, research to underpin veterans' policy and a policy imprimatur for the essential work ONE does on behalf of veterans.<br\/><br\/>We formally proposed the creation of an office of veterans affairs in December 2017.  We believe it is the key enabler to get the other work done.  It would operate in a similar manner to the office of emergency planning, located in Agriculture House, and work with all relevant Departments and other key public authorities.<\/p><p>The envisaged role of the veterans association is facilitating and co-ordinating the delivery of a range of services, providing opportunities to veterans to have their service acknowledged, managing the Government's relationship with veterans, advising the Government on veterans' issues and co-ordinating with other Departments and agencies on aspects of policy that relate to veterans.  The main area of concentration is that it is not a Defence Forces or Department of Defence veterans' policy but an all-of-government veterans' policy.<br\/><br\/>Ourselves and IUNVA do much work in support of veterans.  We have much evidence based on experience but we really believe that the veterans' policy should be underpinned by research on the impact of service and the needs of veterans.  Earlier I spoke about 60 rooms for homeless veterans.  We do not know whether there should be 80 or 50 rooms but we believe, based on our experience, that about 60 is right.  We also believe that empirical evidence is required to move that policy in the right direction.  The research would include: family break-up among veterans; the prevalence of homelessness among the veteran community and other housing issues; the extent and impact of post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD; substance misuse; the impact of institutionalisation and other issues impacting on the transition to civilian life; the differing impact of service on male veterans, female veterans, veterans of differing sexual persuasions and orientation, and differing ethnicities; and of course suicide.<br\/><br\/>Earlier I mentioned that our veteran support centres and, indeed, the veteran support centres of IUNVA were included in the programme for Government on 15 June 2020.  That gave policy <i>imprimatur<\/i>for those veteran support centres.  We would like our other key areas to have equal policy <i>imprimatur<\/i>so that is our homes, counsellors and pathway for end-of-life care, which we operate with section 38 hospitals, and basic multi-annual.  I do not think that either organisation is looking for huge money but we need basic multi-annual funding.<br\/><br\/>In summary, I have provided a snapshot of the last 70 years and what we have done in 2021 in ONE.  I spoke about our strategic plan with our ways, means and ends.  I specifically and deliberately spoke about one of our eight strategic goals, which is goal 3 on veterans' policy.We will take questions at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I ask that these slides might be circulated through our secretariat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#C00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>We gave them in last Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Do we have them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#C00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Excellent because they are very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#C00600","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the distinguished members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for the invitation to attend.  The Chairman has introduced all four of the IUNVA delegation and I wish to mention that between us we have completed 35 overseas tours of duty, including Mr. Kerton who has joined remotely.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Defence Forces has a long and distinguished history of supporting the United Nations that stretches back to 1958 when the first peacekeepers were deployed to Lebanon.  Since then many thousands of Irish men and women have made a significant contribution to peace and security in many of the most challenging security environments in the world.  Relative to the size of the Defence Forces the cost of that service has been high as 87 members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann paid the ultimate price in their endeavours to provide a better life for others.<br\/><br\/>Two members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann remain missing in action, namely, Trooper Patrick Mullins from Kilbehenny in Limerick following events in Elizebthville in the Congo in September 1961, and Private Caoimh&iacute;n Seoige, Inis O&iacute;rr, the Aran Islands following an incident near the village of Dyar Ntar in South Lebanon in April 1981.  I mention Trooper Mullins and Private Seoige as this year marks the 60th and 40th anniversary, respectively, of their disappearance.  Today, as we gather in this historic building, it is appropriate that all of us, veterans and elected representatives, remember our fallen UN veterans, and particularly their families who continue to grieve the loss of loved ones to this day. <b><\/b>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam uasal.<br\/><br\/>I will give an overview of Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA, was formed at a meeting on 10 February 1990 when a group of personnel, that was led by Major General Vincent Savino, who is retired and is currently the president of IUNVA, identified a need to look after veterans and their families who had fallen on hard times, and where in some instances the State had failed them.  The constitution of IUNVA was ratified at its first annual general conference in October 1990.  Today, IUNVA is a recognised not-for-profit veterans association that is based on the principle of volunteerism and providing support to others, which is in line with the ethos and values of our veterans.<br\/><br\/>As a registered charity, IUNVA is compliant with all governance structures as per the Charity Regulator.  IUNVA has in place a robust management structure where the executive committee, who are elected at its annual general convention, run the association on a day-to-day basis.  IUNVA is a non-denominational, non-political and non-sectarian association where membership is open to any Irish resident who has successfully completed a tour of duty with a UN force or organisation whether he or she has retired or not.<br\/><br\/>IUNVA, like our colleagues in ONE is organised on a regional basis with 21 posts that are located throughout the country with many within or adjacent to military installations.  IUNVA members affiliated to their local posts gather, provide support to one another and reminisce about completed overseas trips.  Most importantly, it is through this network that the executive committee of IUNVA manage and co-ordinate post activities across the full spectrum.<br\/><br\/>IUNVA remains unique within the veterans' organisations in that among our more than 1,200 members we have both retired and serving members.  The headquarters of IUNVA is located in 1 Post Arbour House where we recently opened a museum that is dedicated to our veterans service overseas.  I hope that Members might get to visit the museum in the future.<br\/><br\/>I will outlined the aims and objectives of IUNVA.  They are: to ensure that the memory of those who gave their lives in the cause of peace on United Nations service is not forgotten; to provide advice and assistance for members and their families; to encourage, help and assist in the treatment of members who have been adversely affected by their service overseas; to establish, maintain and encourage contact with associations similarly constituted in Ireland and other countries; to promote public understanding of the Irish role in the United Nations operations; to promote and protect the interests of its members; to establish a scheme or schemes to benefit members and their dependants; to rent, take or lease or otherwise acquire property for the purposes of the association and invest the funds of the association in such property or in investment accounts; and to publish pamphlets, periodicals and other documents for the purpose of furthering the interests of the association and its members.  Finally, for the purpose of promotion and achievement of the above objectives, to raise money by subscription of its members and-or raise funds by other lawful means that may be necessary from time to time, and to secure repayment of any money in any manner whatsoever.<br\/><br\/>In terms of funding, as a volunteer organisation all funding received is used to run the association in a professional manner and in the best interests of its members.  The Department of Defence makes an annual contribution of &euro;11,000 towards the running of IUNVA, which is small in the context of what we deliver for our members.  A case to increase funding to &euro;50,000 has been with the Minister for some time now and we await a positive outcome.  I wish to acknowledge funding of &euro;88,000 that has been provided by the Department from dormant accounts, of which a significant portion was used to refurbish our newly opened IUNVA museum.<br\/><br\/>IUNVA members, with the assistance of the finance branch of the Department in Galway, pay a monthly subscription of &euro;2, which is a valuable revenue stream.  IUNVA, like our colleagues in ONE,  are indebted to donations that we receive and a recent contribution of &euro;6,000 from the Leopardstown Park Hospital Trust was greatly appreciated.  This funding was used to conduct a much-needed first aid mental health course for post welfare officers who now have the skillset to allow them better support veterans with mental health issues that have resulted from their overseas service.<br\/><br\/>In the context of activities, on a weekly basis IUNVA members are involved in a myriad of activities with the welfare of our members at its core.  Ceremonially, we support the families of veterans at funerals by providing appropriate military honours while the anniversary of veterans who died on overseas service is remembered on an annual basis.<br\/><br\/>First Aid courses that covering <font color=\"#3C4043\">cardiopulmonary resuscitation<\/font>, CPR and-or <font color=\"#3C4043\">defibrillator usage <\/font>are available to our members as required.  IUNVA is actively involved in the provision of food parcels for members in need, particularly at Christmas time, and we are grateful for the support received from various businesses.  IUNVA also provides accommodation for a number of UN veterans in the Curragh and is actively looking at for more opportunities in this area.<br\/><br\/>Support for veterans with mental health and other associated issues remains a priority.  IUNVA participates in all State and local ceremonial events in its distinctive green blazer with the blue beret of the United Nations.  Regardless of affiliation IUNVA will always provide assistance to veterans and their families in need.<br\/><br\/>IUNVA maintains strong relationships with the Defence Forces with some of its members still serving.Liaison officers are available in all military locations to assist IUNVA as the need arises.  IUNVA receives excellent support from brigade and unit commanders in the provision of facilities for our members to conduct meetings and hold functions as required.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces Benevolent Fund provides much-needed funding to IUNVA on a case-by-case basis.  IUNVA continues to have good relationships with the Department of Defence having met the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Secretary General, Jacqui McCrum, in the past 12 months.  In fact, we are having this year's meeting with the Minister tomorrow week.  This interaction is much needed and appreciated.  Funding, in the form of an annual subvention from the Department of Defence which is governed by a service level agreement, remains an issue and our aspiration to appoint a full-time administrator to manage the ever-increasing activities of IUNVA will also depend on financial support from the Department of Defence.  IUNVA continues to get excellent support from the pensions section in the finance branch in Galway.  We continue to have close relationships with our colleagues in the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO, and the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the White Paper and veterans strategy.  My remarks will complement those of Mr. Campbell.  Paragraph 7.7 of the White Paper on Defence published in 2015 states \"there is scope during the currency of the White Paper to further develop supports available to existing personnel and veterans.\"  This translated into project 59 of the White Paper implementation plan, one of 90 such projects identified from the White Paper.  To advance this, on 5 December 2018 the three veteran associations, ARCO, IUNVA and the Organisation of Retired Ex-Service Personnel, submitted a document titled \"Veterans Strategy\" to the then Minister for Defence, the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff.  This strategy includes strategic goals relating to seven areas: interface with Department of Defence and Defence Forces, transition from military to civilian life, accreditation of unique military skills, pensions and ancillary support, medical support, social housing and recognition of military service.  To date, no progress has been made in advancing the aims of this document in a holistic manner despite it continually being an item on the agenda when meeting Department of Defence representatives.  In February of this year, IUNVA was informed that project 59 had been closed.  This decision was very disappointing not least as it was taken without any reference to IUNVA and other veteran organisations.  IUNVA remains hopeful that a veterans strategy will come to fruition in the short to medium term.  This will require the support of many stakeholders, not least our elected representatives. <\/p><p> Notwithstanding the development of this strategy and subsequent policies to support it, IUNVA strongly advocates for the immediate establishment of a joint office for veterans' affairs supported by the veterans associations and resourced by the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence.  Such an office, with the capacity to link into other Government Departments, would provide veterans with a platform through which issues of importance could be addressed by policymakers.  IUNVA considers that the appointment of a commissioner for veterans' affairs, which would be in line with other European countries, would further demonstrate the State&rsquo;s commitments to veterans and the value it places on their outstanding service both on the island and overseas.<\/p><p> I will sum up by saying that IUNVA's mission statement speaks to remembering, honouring and caring.  That sums up the ethos and values of the organisation and its members.  I thank members of the committee for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan and Mr. Campbell.

Obviously, he has some specialist knowledge of this area.  I would be happy to support the call for the introduction of a veterans strategy.  That is important and would acknowledge not only the work of the organisations which their representatives have outlined, but also the work I know they do at constituency level and have done at national level over recent years.  I have seen the importance of this work and I am extremely disappointed to note that the Department of Defence contribution to that work is no more than &euro;11,000.  I, of course, acknowledge the funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund but that tends to be a little less certain and definite in its disbursement.  Although I know the organisations expend every cent to the greatest benefit, that &euro;11,000 is a paltry sum when one considers the work they do, the members they have and the strategy they wish to implement.  I know they will raise that issue in their meeting with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, next week.  We support the putting together of a strategy.  I assure the witnesses of the help and assistance of this committee in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to give the floor to Deputy Brady, who is joining us remotely from his office due to Covid restrictions.  He will be followed by Deputy Clarke and other members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#D00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Campbell and Mr. Brennan for their opening statements and for coming before the committee this afternoon.  The two statements were excellent and very informative but also very disappointing.  I concur with some of the sentiments the Chairperson has expressed with regard to the excellent work the witnesses have done for the State over many years both as serving members of our forces and through their veterans' organisations.  It is disappointing to see how low the level of funding is and that a request for a small increase, up to &euro;50,000, has fallen on deaf ears.  I did not see any specific mention of funding for the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, so I am not sure how much State funding it gets annually.  Perhaps Mr. Campbell could outline that.<\/p> <p>  I also concur with regard to the veterans strategy.  That is key, as is the proposed office of veterans' affairs.  I know that request has been made since 2017.  Will the witnesses outline what engagement has taken place with the Ministers and the Department?  What kind of feedback has there been?<\/p> <p>  I hear what Mr. Campbell is saying.  Obviously, everything needs to be based on evidence.  We need the data and the information.  That is crucial to developing a plan and a strategy.  I hear what he is saying with regard to accommodation for veterans who are homeless.  His organisation estimates that there is a need for 60 beds.  Will he elaborate further on that?  I also note that he said it is hoped to open six additional beds in Cork next year.  Will he give us a little bit more information on that?  When exactly will they be opened?<\/p> <p>  I will home in on the issue of transitional supports.  From my engagement with members of the Defence Forces, I know they feel there is a vacuum in that regard.  The current system is totally inadequate.  It does not enhance or develop the skills members have gained while in the Defence Forces or prepare them for the transition to civilian life.  I have always called for a career guidance position to be created in that regard.  I note that both organisations are calling for transitional supports to be put in place.  Will they paint a picture as to how they see that role and how it would work?  That is it for now.  I may have some supplementary questions.  I commend the work both organisations are doing and thank them both for their continued service to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#D00300","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from both organisations and thank them for the work they are doing.  I was recently at the opening of the ONE centre in Cobh.<\/p><p>It was extraordinarily impressive and there was a large turnout.  It was great to see it occurring there.  I know Mr. Campbell was there as well.  I was at the opening of IUNVA's post 25 in Fermoy a number of years ago.  Again, that is doing great work.<\/p><p> I served as an amateur in the Reserve Defence Force for years so I have some knowledge of what goes on, although obviously not overseas.  I want to ask about what Deputy Brady raised, that is, the transition and preparation for leaving the Defence Forces.  We know there is a lot of support when one is a member of the Defence Forces and the comradeship that was mentioned earlier is hugely important.  When one leaves, unless one has family support or whatever else outside, that can have an impact.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the preparation for retirement or leaving the Defence Forces.  What is in place there?  Is it adequate?  Could it be improved upon in any way?<\/p><p> I am also struck by both organisations' references to mental health, particularly IUNVA and the impact serving abroad has on some members.  Mr. Brennan might expand on that and give us some examples of what is happening and how we can assist and help.  What kind of impact does that have and why does it happen to people?  Can we do more to assist people in that regard?<\/p><p> I also want to comment on the remembrance commemorations that occur across the country.  I recognise the role that both organisations play through their members turning up.  The branch in Cobh in my constituency is particularly active.  It is hugely important that that happens because it happens in public.  We have parades in public, as well as the flag-raising, the trooping of the colours, the speeches and so forth.  That is hugely important and that is something we must continue and the organisations need to be supported.<\/p><p> I join with the Chair in saying I would be very supportive of the Government providing more funding to both organisations.  I am also intrigued by the commission for veterans' affairs that has been mentioned.  I am quite disappointed that project 59 has been closed.  Perhaps we should write to the Minister to see why that happened, what the thinking behind it was and if it can be reactivated.

Mr. Brennan spoke about medical needs.  Is he seeing something in veterans today that is specific to their service?  As we age and go through life we can develop various different medical conditions and medical needs but is there a link between what the veterans are experiencing now and their service in the past?  If that is the case, what supports are in place for those individuals, whether for physical or mental health?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Brennan also mentioned a benevolent fund.  I ask him to give us some more detail on what is behind that and what are the asks with regard to this fund.<\/p> <p>  I have to be honest; I am beyond concerned to hear that food parcels are being handed out to our veterans.  I find that absolutely despicable.  It is a horrendous thing to hear any organisation say of those who have given their service in the past.<\/p> <p>  There was also mention of an advice clinic.  I ask the witnesses to give us a bit more detail about what veterans are looking for advice on.  Is it applications to State agencies for support and assistance, or perhaps passport services?  What exactly are the questions that tend to come forward?<\/p> <p>  I echo what previous contributors have said about the veterans' strategy being way beyond overdue.

Our accounts are online on our website.  I think it was &euro;968,000 last year for non-capital funding but that did not include the costings for Cobh.  We currently get &euro;100,000 from the Department of Defence.  We recently applied for an increase in that but it would be wrong to comment on that as it was only recently.<\/p> <p>  Our Dublin hostel, Br&uacute; na bhFiann in Smithfield, gets partly funded by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive which, as the committee knows, runs the homeless sector on behalf of the four councils in Dublin.  We get approximately &euro;270,000 or &euro;280,000 per annum from it.  One of our counsellors is paid for by the HSE, as I mentioned, so that is &euro;45,000 per annum for that counsellor.  That is the State funding, give or take, and then we raise the rest of it ourselves through fundraising, membership fees and donations.  Our residents all pay for their keep as well.  It is very important to say that because we are preparing our residents to move into permanent accommodation and one of the key things there is to make sure they look after themselves properly, look after the rooms they are given properly and pay for their keep.  They must get used to looking after themselves.  I hope that answers Deputy Brady's question on funding<\/p> <p>  As we said, we believe that the creation of an office of veterans' affairs, similar in construct to the office of emergency planning in Agriculture House, is central to not just creating a veterans' policy but to delivering on whatever that policy is.  As I said earlier, most of the issues that we come up against are not defence-related.  They are issues of housing and health.  Those are the two key issues we come up against all the time.  Mr. O'Connor and I then have to try to find contacts in that regard.  That would be much better done if we had somewhere to go, such as a single point of contact where we could go if we had an issue in health and the person in the office of veterans' affairs would get onto his or her contact in the Department of Health and try to resolve that.  In the last few weeks we have had meetings with the HSE, Cork County Council and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We are not experts in these areas and we have to find those contacts.  They are great once we meet them but it could be better facilitated by having this office of veterans' affairs.  I think we are making progress on it, to answer Deputy Brady's question.  We met with the Secretary General of the Department of Defence quite recently on this matter and we also met with the Commission on the Defence Forces.  We brought up one single issue with it and that was the veterans' policy.  That commission is reporting next month.<\/p><p>I am hopeful it will report favourably in that regard.

It is important because it also would institutionalise veterans as an important part of Irish society.  At present, a veteran leaves the Defence Forces who might go out after a full career, like myself, or alternatively might go into a civilian employment.  They just go back into society.  A veterans&rsquo; association and a veterans' office would be hugely important.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Brady and Stanton spoke about issues in relation to supports available to personnel leaving the Defence Forces.  By way of explanation, in my last appointment in the Defence Forces, one of my key areas of interest was on how can we best support people who leave the Defence Forces either early or at the end of their careers.  We instituted a policy of continuous professional development in the Defence Forces, which I have no doubt is continuing.  It allowed people to develop the skill sets that were easily translatable out in civilian life.  To explain exactly what that means, we linked up with the Institute of Technology Carlow, which allowed for non-commissioned officers and private soldiers to acquire skill sets that were associated with levels of competence in the university sector.  For example, people could have a level 6, level 7 or level 8 degree coming out of Institute of Technology Carlow, which included a recognition of their prior learning, plus associated work that they did in Carlow.  My good colleague who is present, Mr. Murray, is a product of that.  There certainly are supports for people to develop skill sets and have them recognised when they go out into civilian life.  Of course, as people leave the Defence Forces, there is a retirement course conducted which gives them information on how best to deal with some of the issues they will face as they go into civilian life.  As I said, that is where it was up to recently.  I presume that it is still continuing.  Would Mr. Campbell like to add anything to that, because I know he was involved in this process as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor and I spoke to what they called the transition to civilian life course.  It was the pre-retirement course.  The vast majority of people leaving the Defence Forces do not retire anymore.  The word \"retire\" suggests that they are going to a pension, or something like that.  They are going out to civilian life.  If I could mention one thing, it is that there is a huge number of skilled people in the Defence Forces.  It is moving them on to civilian life.  For instance, they could easily transfer to the public sector, Departments and State agencies, but they are probably precluded from doing so now through pension abatement and issues like that.  It is probably something that could be looked at.<\/p> <p>  They get fantastic skills in the Defence Forces, but sometimes those skills are not codified in language that an employer may understand.  If, for example, Mr. Murray was a sergeant major, we all know what a sergeant major means but the prospective employer may not know that.  The sergeant major is in charge of and runs the HR for 400 or 500 people, for instance.  They should put it in that plain, simple language.  We believe that the testimonial, as it is called in the Defence Forces, which is the equivalent of a reference, needs attention as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Campbell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The testimonial, as Mr. Campbell said, is four lines on a small page.  Deputy Stanton asked about mental health first aid.  I will share this with IUNVA.  We have trained in the past year 70 mental health first aiders.  We have two veterans support officers and we have clinicians, as we said earlier to Deputy Berry.  We have another clinician in Athlone.  We find now that particularly the veteran support office who is at the head office, because he reports directly to me, is dealing with everything from suicidal ideation to the payment of an electricity bill.  We can handle the electricity bill through the Defence Forces benevolent fund of which we spoke.  We are very involved with the Defence Forces benevolent fund.  Some of us here are on the executive of the Defence Forces benevolent fund.   If things are done right, we can help veterans.  However, many veterans do not know about the Defence Forces benevolent fund and that is a problem.

The Defence Forces benevolent fund is a fund that is set up within the Defence Forces, where serving members of Defence Forces make a subscription to it.  It is used for various reasons.  The veterans associations have been able to get access to that funding over the last number of years.  As I said, along with colleagues in ONE, we do it on a case-by-case basis.  I will give one example of a recent case that we put forward of an old soldier, who had served in the Army apprentice school in Naas and who died a number of years ago.  His grave in Naas needed refurbishment and it had no headstone.  This was not fitting for an old soldier who served his country well, not just at home but overseas.  Mr. Thompson, who I will ask to speak about mental health issues in a moment, put in a case to the benevolent fund.  We got the funding to put a proper headstone and a proper surround around that veteran&rsquo;s grave.  There was also a small commemoration to remember him.  That just shows the type of value of the Defence Forces benevolent fund, which I commend for supporting the veterans.  All of them will become veterans in due course.<\/p> <p>  On mental health, the Deputy asked a question about the linkage between overseas service and mental health issues at home.  Obviously, I am not a professional so I cannot definitively say, but based on my personal experience of traumas that people have experienced overseas and, indeed, some of my own personal experience, my own personal, private view is that there is a definite link in respect of that.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Thompson, who is our national welfare officer to speak briefly on that particular issue of mental health in respect of IUNVA veterans.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Good afternoon a Chathaoirligh and the committee.  We want to thank you for the opportunity, as both associations said, for giving us a chance to talk.  I would also like to thank the Cathaoirleach as we are two people from the same town of Mountmellick.  We are running CPR courses, defibrillator courses and mental health first aid courses, as Mr. O&rsquo;Connor has mentioned.  As a matter of fact, this Friday we are running another CPR defibrillator course in our drop-in centre in Athlone.  Once we leave the Defence Forces, we cannot have access to the personal support services any longer.   The personal support services are for access by serving personnel who are dealing with mental health problems.  We then have to go ourselves to get help for housing and mental health and all that affects our veterans.  That is the help that we need.  We are not professionals.  For instance, our local post in Portlaoise is in the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, building in Portlaoise.  That is because of the goodness of the Defence Forces.  They are moving to a new building in the next year or two.  We have been told that we will have two rooms in there.  If we did not have the RDF building in Portlaoise, we would have nowhere to meet.<\/p><p>We would not have the money to rent somewhere else.  We are in the local community supporting the local community.  We have all served.  We have drop-in centres throughout the country, in Athlone, Fermoy and Clonmel, but we pay rent on most of those buildings.  We do not pay rent on the one in Portlaoise.  As I said, we are there with the support of the Defence Forces.  Individual veterans have to turn up in the HSE's offices looking for help.  The access we had while serving is gone.  Once we take off that uniform and walk out, we do not have that access.<\/p><p> The other main thing is the Army benevolent fund, of which both IUNVA and ONE are members.  It is a great opportunity for veterans.  We are the eyes and the ears out there for the Defence Forces Benevolent Fund.  We have plots in Bohernabreena, Donegal, Athlone and Mullingar.  Our aim is to make sure that no veteran is left in a pauper's grave.  Earlier this year we buried a veteran in one of our cemeteries in Dublin.  The Defence Forces Benevolent Fund paid for the opening of the plot but he was buried in one of our plots.  We put a plaque on the plot.  He will be remembered.  Just last Saturday, in Portlaoise, in our local post, we brought in the family of one of our colleagues.  We framed his medals and presented that to his family.  That is very important to families.  We are proud to wear the medals we wear and proud to serve, as Mr. Campbell said.  I heard Deputy Stanton talk about the opening of post 25 in Fermoy.  That post has been supporting the Mullins family every year at the mass in Kilbeheny.  Every year IUNVA remembers Patrick Mullins.  Like every other veteran, as members of the two organisations have said, we in the veterans' organisations will not forget him.  We go to the church and run the flags up the church.  The Defence Forces put up a memorial for him in the graveyard in Kilbeheny a few years ago as well.<\/p><p> Mr. Brennan mentioned outside courses.  Even for lower-ranking veterans leaving the Army, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, courses are brilliant to do.  I did one such course.  I left the Army then and went to work in the hospital in Tullamore.  I started off there as a porter.  Through the FETAC course, I ended up going back and becoming a radiographer assistant because I had military training.  For the soldier who is leaving and who may not have completed his leaving certificate, the FETAC courses are brilliant to do.  As Mr. Brennan said, Mr. Murray beside us has done a course in Carlow.<\/p><p> We need more support for our veterans.  We have a house in the Curragh where veterans live.  We have a house in Cavan, in respect of which negotiations are ongoing with the council.  We hope we may be allowed to build onto that house and put a few more veterans in it.  They come in of a Thursday morning for the cup of tea and the chat, as Mr. Campbell said.  We hear what their problems are.  We try to support them in typing up letters and dealing with social services.  That is where the veterans' office comes in.  We need more support.  As I said, if we did not have the post in Portlaoise, where would we meet?  We are based completely on voluntary money.  None of us are getting paid.  Just last weekend, I put in Thursday, Friday and Saturday supporting veterans.  We had a GoFundMe fundraiser set up through the sergeant major in the 27th Battalion to help the people of Lebanon.  We raised something like &euro;2,500 through social media with ex-members of the Defence Forces' support.  We presented a cheque.  A chap who served in Lebanon died and had no headstone.  We in ONE went up there and IUNVA and ONE are supporting the erection of a headstone over that veteran's grave.  He served his country.  He should not be buried without a headstone in a pauper's grave.  That is where our veterans association comes in.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and the Chairman for the opportunity to come in, to talk to the committee and to get our point across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Mr. Brennan, are you done with those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to Deputy Stanton.

Of late, Covid-19 is getting more prevalent and we had a case quite recently.  However, our homes had to become more restrictive.  What was normal in our homes two to three years ago, social interaction and being able to come and go, could not happen.  Many of our residents found it challenging.  There is little doubt about that.  Our veterans support centres and our branches were all but closed, but we met remotely.  What Mr. O'Connor did, and I will ask him to talk about it, was equip our welfare officers with mobile telephones, IT systems and so forth.  He set up WhatsApp groups to keep veterans in contact.  Remember that many of our veterans are quite elderly, but their ability to transition to new platforms is extraordinary.<\/p> <p>  From a financial point of view, it affected our fundraising.  I am looking at the figures in our audited account.  Our collections in 2019 were &euro;142,000.  In 2020, it was &euro;288.  It went from &euro;142,000 to &euro;288.  I must say, on a positive note, the Covid stability funds through Pobal gave us great assistance.<\/p> <p>  What we are looking for is in respect of our future residents, the people who may not be homeless today but who might become homeless tomorrow or the day after.  There is an increase in rental costs after Covid-19.  The costs of purchasing or renting houses are only going one way.  Then there are the social pressures on families because of Covid.  There is an increase in gambling, alcohol abuse and drug abuse.  There is also the stress of Covid on families.  Approximately 50% of our residents, and I am open to correction on that figure, arrive because of family break up.  I believe that is quite standard in the homelessness sector throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  There are impacts on many levels.  On a positive level, we certainly thank the Government for the funding we received through the Pobal scheme.  However, as we transition out of Covid, and I realise the transition is probably going to be a lot longer than we expected, that is where the real challenges will lie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanton has a supplementary question arising out of an earlier discussion.

Can anything be done to assist in growing the membership?  Obviously, if there were more members, the good work the organisations do would be made known to more people and there would be more support from former members as well.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier, I think by IUNVA, that it is a little like the Men's Shed, where people come together.  Is it mainly men who are receiving assistance?  I realise there is an imbalance in the Defence Forces between men and women, but perhaps the witnesses would comment on that.  Would I be correct in saying that many of the people the organisations deal with are single?

All the clubs we remember from when we were young, such as the men's clubs and card clubs, are all gone.  People are looking at their tablets or their televisions.  People who have left the Defence Forces have worn a uniform for all their time in the Defence Forces.  When they join our organisation, and I believe IUNVA might be the same, they do not have to wear a uniform, but they do not really believe that.  That is a problem.<\/p> <p>  As regards women, we are currently developing a diversity and inclusion policy.  For the first time, we have two women directors on the board of directors.  One was co-opted because of her skills and the other was elected by the membership.  We hope to grow our women membership and our membership generally, because we cannot operate without membership.  That is a problem.<\/p> <p>  Regarding something else that was said earlier, the Defence Forces is an institution.  Similar to all institutions, the members' behaviours are modified.  Then they leave.  When I left the Defence Forces, for example, I realised I had to pay for inhalers.  All of that had been done previously.  The cloak that was around the person previously is no longer there.  The vast majority of people who leave the Defence Forces do not have a pension.  It is only those who have served 21 years, as it was in my time, and now it is 30 years since the passing of the single pensions Act.  We have to get over the perception people have that everyone who leaves the Defence Forces has a pension.  People who leave the Defence Forces have the same problems as everyone else in society and they do not always like going to somebody else to try to solve their problems.  They have been problem solvers throughout their career in the Defence Forces, and now it is themselves.  That is where we come in.  It could be for a cup of tea, and a couple of weeks later one finds there is a real problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ollie O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Does that answer your question, Deputy Stanton?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#H00500","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Yes, it does.

However, the younger generation is retiring after 21 years and may have done, perhaps, one or two missions overseas.  When I was overseas there were 760 troops.  There was a great deal of sport and camaraderie over there, but now the young lad is on his iPhone.  The troops do not gel as much or the friendship is not there as much.  They are fairly isolated in their daily jobs compared with what we did, which was more outdoors and more adventurous with more patrols.  The overseas experience now is very contained.

I am sorry I missed a small part of their presentations as I had to attend the Order of Business.  The first matter regarding membership and retaining membership is an issue we encountered during my time in the Teachers Union of Ireland.  Teachers retired after their service, melted away and were lost to the organisation.<\/p><p>The Retired Members Association put in place a pre-retirement programme, part of which involved the association meeting people who were about to leave and encouraging them to join it.  I do not know whether the witnesses' organisations have that facility, but they can address the matter in a few moments.<\/p><p> Three or four years ago, I introduced the Defence (Veterans Lapel Badge) Bill in the Seanad.  It was a simple little Bill and the idea behind it was to give a singular form of branding, as it were, to every veteran who left.  The idea comes from the UK, where every veteran who has at least one year's service and leaves without any blemish on his or her record is entitled to apply for a veteran's pin.  To aid and abet the organisations' memberships, if both of them were in a position to issue a veterans lapel pin were it to come into force, they would have a database of all veterans throughout the country.  It would help the organisations to grow.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on this suggestion.<\/p><p> A number of the witnesses are familiar with Mr. Danny Kinahan from Northern Ireland.  They will be aware that the commissioner's office was not an easy transition and that it took some time to put in place, although the one in Britain came about quite easily.  I would be interested in hearing their views on two matters, the first of which is the importance of a veterans office.  They may have dealt with this idea in my absence.  The second matter is the importance of the role of commissioner and how it might fit into their organisations.<\/p><p> Mr. Brennan mentioned education.  I believe he was a major general when he invited me to Carlow for a graduation ceremony.  It is one of the great innovations of the Defence Forces in modern times that no soldier needs to leave without an academic skill of some sort or other, be it Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, Quality and Qualifications Ireland or whatever.  In Mr. Brennan's service days, was any effort ever made to link up with organisations like Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, Intel and other large companies?  In the UK, there is a veterans programme where some large organisations show a natural bias towards veterans by taking in and training a small number of them each year.  I do not know whether that is something that the Defence Forces has explored, but I would be interested in knowing.<\/p><p> I believe it was 1979 or 1980 when I was walking up a street in Limerick and met a former member of my old battalion, An Ch&eacute;ad Chathl&aacute;n Coisithe.  The man was a vagrant at that stage, had nowhere to go and was in a pitiful state.  Mr. O'Connor made the point that the situation had probably changed now, but many members of my generation who joined the Defence Forces stayed there for their 30 years or more and were institutionalised.  When it came to leaving back in the good old days, people used to be left in the barracks and no one ever took much notice, but that has all changed and it is not allowed now.  Thankfully, ONE has accommodation.  Regarding the resettlement programme, does Mr. O'Connor see a need for further houses in places like Galway and other parts of the country?  Has he spoken to any of the housing agencies to support that?<\/p><p> The issue of pension abatement was referenced a few moments ago.  It has been of great concern to me for a long time.  The skills with which people leave the Defence Forces were mentioned.  First and foremost, we are a disciplined organisation.  Generally speaking, if a soldier or member of the Air Corps or Naval Service leaves the forces, a future employer can be assured that he or she will turn up at 9 a.m., deliver a full day's work and leave in the evening when he or she has to.  That person will always be available if an emergency arises because that is the way we have been trained to work.<\/p><p> We now find that, due to slow recruitment, we need to bring back many of the skills that we lost through retirement.  For example, one will find a number of former Naval Service personnel working in the Naval Service and a number of former Army personnel working in the armouries of the Curragh and various other places around the country.  However, the word coming back to me is that, due to pension abatement, fewer people want to return to the public service because they can retain their pensions while holding jobs in the private sector and reaping the rewards of the service they gave to the State.  I am aware that there is the likelihood of a High Court challenge because there are several examples of a pension being treated as a property right that no one can touch.  Are the witnesses hearing anything from their members about how pension abatement is impacting their lives and, in particular, their career choices?  If we cannot bring back armourers and Naval Service personnel because of it, we are in serious trouble.  There are other ways around the problem, one of which could be a different salary scale, but pensions should never be touched.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#H01000","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I wish the gentlemen a good afternoon and thank them for appearing before the committee.  I also thank for them for their comprehensive opening statements, which I have read in detail.  I thank them for the great service that they provided to the State when they were in uniform and the great service that they continue to provide even in retirement.  It is appreciated.<\/p> <p>  I will single out the fantastic and incredible work that is being done across the country in the vaccination centres and Covid testing facilities.  It is great that the Defence Forces are still in a position to contribute.  From a ceremonial point of view, the splash, colour and class when Army veterans are on parade is of note, as is their charity work.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton rightly pointed out that there were approximately 13,000 military pensioners.  However, I suspect there are infinitely more people who left before reaching 21 or 31 years of service.  Does ONE know approximately how many military veterans there are, including veterans of the Reserve Defence Force?  It strikes me that the Defence Forces are Ireland's ultimate network and a professional constituency that is worthy of respect, if the witnesses understand what I am saying.  How many veterans are there?  They seem to be in every town and village and up every boreen and byroad in the country.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for IUNVA.  I noted from its opening statement that only &euro;11,000 is provided to it every year, which is peanuts compared to the great service IUNVA provides.  On what does it spend that &euro;11,000?  It has submitted a case for increasing the amount to &euro;50,000.  If the provision was increased to that amount, on what would it spend that money?<\/p> <p>  My final question is on the academic research on veteran-specific issues that ONE is requesting.  Has ONE approached any third level institution's department of psychiatry, psychology, counselling or so on to see whether it would be interested in placing a postdoctoral student with, for example, ONE or IUNVA to examine or explore veteran-specific issues?  If not and a third level institution was listening to the testimony this afternoon, would the witnesses welcome an approach about placing postdoctoral students with them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021111600002#J00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time, but I will add to Senator Craughwell and Deputy Berry's questions by inviting the witnesses to comment on their expectations and hopes following their engagement with the Commission on the Defence Forces.

We get access to all of them.  They are on Zoom now, though, so the personal interaction with the person who is retiring is not there.  Mr. O'Connor and I have attended very many such courses but, as the Senator knows, it really comes down to the business we do before and after the courses, not the talks that we give during them.  I presume IUNVA feels the same that Zoom talks are not as satisfactory.  That is no one's fault, though.<\/p> <p>  We would warmly welcome the Senator's veteran's lapel Bill.  I can only speak for ONE and cannot be any clearer than that.<\/p><p>We would warmly welcome it.  As Mr. Brennan said earlier, It would give Government recognition to those who served.  I would certainly warmly welcome it.<\/p><p> I refer to the office of veterans' affairs and the example of the commissioner in Northern Ireland.  The office of veterans' affairs operates in a similar manner to the Office of Emergency Planning.  It works with all relevant Departments and other key public authorities, in addition to its role as listed in the briefing document, which I will not go through again.  We believe it should be staffed by members of the Defence Forces and civil servants.  I should probably include a senior officer and senior non-commissioned officer, NCO, from the Defence Forces and similar personnel from the Department of Defence or another civil servant.  The commissioner is important in that it is a figure head that is required.  I saw Danny Kinahan at services in the North during the weekend.  Mr. O'Connor and I met him when he was just appointed and then we met him down here two months ago.  He has six personal staff.  We are not looking for anything like that.  We need a basic office to start with and then let us grow it.<\/p><p> Institutionalisation was referred to earlier.  That is exceptionally true for the older veteran.  When we joined the Defence Forces, many of the people with whom we joined came from industrial schools and orphanages and literally went from one institution to another.  For instance, the Defence Forces' school of music was staffed by boys from the then Artane Boys Band.  One can see the impact on the older veterans who came from an institution and joined an institution.  It is no surprise that they would end up with us in one of our residential homes.<\/p><p> The abatement issue we raised earlier.  We would agree with the member in that regard.  It impacts on very good people going into the public sector.  As Deputy Stanton said earlier, the private sector will take them no problem so why would the public sector not take them as well?  They are good, skilled people who are disciplined and turn up for work every single day.

I have been at ceremonies in Carlow over a number of years where men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann have received levels 6, 7 and 8 degrees and some of them had not even completed a leaving certificate.

Deputy Berry asked about the &euro;11,000 grant that we get from the Defence Forces.  That goes out in the form of two cheques, one to our insurer and the other to our accountant.  That is where that money goes.  We asked that the grant be increased because Covid hit all 21 of our posts, which are countrywide and totally self-sufficient in terms of being voluntary.  They depended on their bucket day collections, lottery draws and so on but all of that dried up and they were in the red and in trouble.  We asked for support for them with their rent, heating, transport and other bills.  Our accountant came back to me after doing a survey of all our posts and indicated that we were down by &euro;55,000 for last year.

We may differ on the detail of what that office might be, where it might be located or how it might be resourced but it is important that this committee takes a stance on the issue on behalf of the witnesses.  I ask members to endorse the writing of a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence urging the delivery of a veterans strategy in accordance with statements made previously and the creation of an office of veteran affairs.

It moves the threshold from annual income of &euro;20,687 to &euro;21,295 to ensure that the 2% rate remains the highest rate of USC charged on the income of full-time minimum wage workers.  This has arisen from the 30% increase to the minimum wage that was recommended by the Low Pay Commission.<\/p> <p> I would have huge concerns that this 30 cent increase will not do much for the people who are relying on this minimum wage when inflation is currently running at approximately 5%.  The Minister has raised on many occasions his concern about the rise in inflation.  This 30 cent increase will only bring it up to &euro;10.50.  Putting it in context, we all will be aware, if we look at our local butchers or our local shop, that there are price increases.  This increase will not be enough to offset the cost of inflation that we are witnessing.  According to conservative estimates, there are 135,000 people on the minimum wage and relying on this.  We need to be mindful of the real-life impact when discussing this.  These are not only figures.  They represent people who are relying on this.  We see the huge rise in inflation and the cost of living in energy prices, etc., and the impact that it will have.  The minimum wage is still far lower than the living wage of &euro;12.90.  We need to be quite ambitious in this regard because people are struggling on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the move to extend the reduced rate of USC until the end of 2022 for full medical card holders under 70 years of age whose individual annual income does not exceed &euro;60,000 but, although the Finance Bill can be quite technical and although it can seem removed from society, we need to think of the real-life impact that those people who are on the minimum wage experience due to the increase in inflation and the increased cost of living.

Far be it for me to speak for the Low Pay Commission, but it may very well be that when the commission was considering its recommendation and the data, because there is an evidence-based approach to the recommendation in terms of the setting of the minimum wage, it may not have had the up-to-date information that we have now on the trends in relation to inflation.

A process with an independent group acting on behalf of the State, evaluating information independently of the Government or its view on the matter, is the right process.  It has been a reason this is just one of a series of increases to the minimum wage in recent years.  When we are debating this minimum wage, the context in which it should be seen is not just looking at this as a single move, but as a series of moves that have taken place over recent years, as a response from the State to support those who are earning the least as our economy is growing.  The challenge from a tax policy point of view relates to those who are on a low level of income in the first place.  They tend to pay a lower level of tax.  This is a consequence of having a starting position of a highly progressive tax code.  Any changes that we make at the lower level of income sometimes lead to a change in take-home pay that can be a subject of debate.  Some would say that we are making a change that is only worth a small amount of money to somebody on a low level of income.  That is a consequence of the fact that they are not paying a high level of tax in the first place.  It is a reason why the work of the Low Pay Commission is important.  I have no doubt that, as it continues its independent process into next year and beyond, the kind of trends that are developing in the cost of living will be considered seriously by the Low Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's views, it is important that the committee be aware that changes such as the one I am making to reduce the level of universal social charge that somebody would pay on the minimum wage were not included in Sinn F&eacute;in's proposed budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in has taken the overall view that there should be no changes in personal taxation at a time when the cost of living is increasing for many.  I take a different view.  I believe that targeted changes in our tax code that are inside the parameters agreed by the Government as part of our summer economic statement are appropriate to help those who are under pressure and facing challenges because of an increase in the cost of living.  Some on the Opposition benches take a different view.  While I listen to Deputy Farrell's view on the adequacy of this proposal, it is much more adequate than doing nothing at all, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in proposes.  This is a sensible change.  I accept that one could ask the question as to whether it is enough but it has to be seen in the context of changes made in budgets each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#B00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":421,"content":"<p>We all agree that we want to see an increase in the minimum wage.

We believe that if a business has a net profit exceeding &euro;1.5 million per year, it could shoulder a burden more fairly than people who are on a lower income.  When we talk about lower incomes, we are talking on people on a broad range of incomes.  We are looking at people on incomes of &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000, or less, and at the ever-increasing basic living costs, including for energy, heat, and fuel.  It is unprecedented.  I have been the holder of a high carbon licence for more than 30 years, in other words, selling petrol and diesel, and I have never seen such a spike in costs for the customer as we have seen over the past 12 months.  We are quickly heading to &euro;2 per litre, which is having a significant knock-on effect on the price of everything, because everything in this country comes by wheels.

Let me say that, in spite of whatever allegations the Minister may throw at others, we are consistent in putting forward alternative proposals to raise revenue to provide for our objective to significantly increase expenditure in housing, health, education, and in other key infrastructures and services.  We do so consistently every year.  We have been consistent in saying that the universal social charge, USC, was an unfair austerity tax imposed on workers.  It was particularly unfair, given that the Government trenchantly resists efforts to impose additional taxes, as it did during the austerity period, but it continues to be largely opposed to redistributing the tax burden in a fair way.  The only discussion that ever seems to take place is a discussion about increasing or maybe occasionally slightly reducing the tax burden on the majority.  Never do we talk about what we think is the elephant in the room.  That is the gross inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in Irish society.  If we were to have a policy objective of trying to redistribute income and wealth to move towards a more equal society, then it could be done.  It could produce much revenue and it could result in a fairer society.  In our view, never has that been more justified than in the context of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Working people really demonstrated how important they are.  It was the retail workers, public sector workers, transport workers, health workers, and many others who kept us going when society was shut down.  They showed how important they are.  They are very often the same workers who are hammered by the universal social charge and who are on much lower incomes.  That contrasts with how net household wealth increased substantially in Irish society, even during the Covid-19 period.  However, most of that wealth and income is concentrated in the top 10% or so of our society.  We think that for all of those reasons it is justified to take radical measures to redistribute the tax burden and, through that, to redistribute wealth and income more generally.  That is the logic of what we are doing.

I would like to put this on record, and I said it during the budget.  The total income that comes to PAYE workers, or to the 2.8 million workers who pay tax and USC, is &euro;130 billion.  Their total tax and USC contribution on that &euro;130 billion is &euro;27 billion.  That is from the Department&rsquo;s ready reckoner.  Corporations&rsquo; total income is &euro;203 billion and their total tax contribution is &euro;11 billion.  That is an extraordinary contrast, is it not?  The corporations make &euro;203 billion.  That profit has gone up by approximately 172% in gross declared pre-tax profits since 2012.  Therefore, the corporate sector makes about 70% to 80% more than workers in pre-tax income.  It pays almost three times what 2.8 billion workers pay, who between them earn only &euro;130 billion.  That shows in a stark way that the workers get less and pay much more.  The corporations, whose profits have gone through the roof, earn much more profits and pay much less tax.  That is just unfair in our view and we will continue to highlight this.<\/p> <p>  This particular amendment intersects with a number of other amendments that seek to address that, whether it is through wealth taxes, or a higher earners&rsquo; social charge to replace the universal social charge, which, for the record, we have always said should be abolished completely.  We are for getting rid of the universal social charge completely and replacing it with higher bands of income tax on the highest earners with a higher income social charge.

It is a discussion we need to have in this country, if we want to fund the public services we say that we all want to see.  However, I would be careful about how we should proceed, particularly around income at this sensitive time, considering everything that our economy is experiencing at the moment.  Then again, the focus needs to be on wealth.  Deputy Boyd Barrett will know well that the vast bulk of wealth in this country is not in incomes but in assets.  Many of those are non-productive assets that are often passed from generation to generation, often relatively unmolested by the Revenue Commissioners.  That is where the discussion, I think, needs to be, with respect to what the movers of the amendment wish to achieve.  I would guard against any movement in the direction of focusing imprecisely on taxable income at this stage in the game.  Our focus should be entirely on net assets and how we can tax them in a way that will benefit our society more broadly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#C00600","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their amendments.  There are a considerable number of issues with this amendment.  These include the cost on the Exchequer, the significant erosion of the tax base, and the impact on the competiveness of our tax code.  On Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the universal social charge, it is estimated that this would cost &euro;4.4 billion in a single year.  The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to replace the USC with a high-income social charge of 10% on all earnings &euro;90,000 would yield &euro;1.59 billion in a single year.  Therefore, this would give rise to a shortfall of approximately &euro;2.8 billion for the year.<\/p><p>In fact, it is estimated it would be necessary to place an additional charge of 28% on all earnings over &euro;90,000 in order raise an equivalent level of revenue for the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to be cost neutral to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> With regard to the Rural Independent Group&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the USC for those earning less than &euro;70,000 and replace it with a national solidarity tax on incomes of those earning in excess of &euro;120,000 per year, I note the Deputies have not specified the level of income tax rates that would apply under this proposal.  However, it is estimated the removal of the application of the USC on all incomes below &euro;70,000 would cost in the region of &euro;1.7 billion in a single year.  Assuming no other policy changes to the structure of the charges, it is likely that if the new tax took the form of a new USC rate for those earning over &euro;120,000 it would need to be as high as 14% in order to raise the same level of revenue for the Exchequer and ensure this is a cost neutral proposal.<\/p><p> I note the estimations I provided do not take account of any behavioural change that could result from the significant increase in marginal rates of taxation.  To introduce any higher rate of USC would increase the marginal rate of tax.  High marginal tax rates could cause harm to our international competitiveness.  The considerable progress that has been made in recent years to restore our economy cannot be taken for granted, especially given the challenges in the international arena we confront at present.<\/p><p> Abolishing the USC in its entirety or exempting those earning up to &euro;70,000 per year would considerably erode the tax base.  The current exemption threshold for USC is &euro;13,000 per annum and it is estimated 28% of all income earners will not be liable to USC in 2022.  To further increase this entry threshold to &euro;70,000 would abolish and exempt about 88% of income earners from USC, or 100% if the USC was abolished in its entirety.  This would significantly narrow the income tax base and would expose our economy to significant risk in the event of a future economic downturn.  The USC is an important and sustainable source of revenue for the Exchequer.<\/p><p> I note Deputies have also suggested raising money also from companies whose profits are in excess of &euro;1.5 million per year.  This could have serious consequences for the competitiveness of our corporation tax regime with potentially significant impacts for our overall economy.  Some of the main features of the current corporation tax regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base.  Changing this rate or imposing additional levies on corporate profits would involve increased complexity and this could change the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax offering.  It is impossible to accurately predict the effect changes to the rate would have on the behaviour and decisions of large employers in Ireland.  This uncertainty prevents a reliable estimate being made of any yield that might accrue to the Exchequer.  While it is possible imposing such a levy could lead to theoretical gains, it could also potentially lead to lower levels of economic activity and to companies passing the additional tax burden onto their staff, customers, suppliers and investors.  Therefore, having regard to these issues I do not believe there is a need to carry out any further analysis of the proposal outlined here and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#C00700","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much for that.

Again, I can see it working to the advantage of the person on the lower income but also that of smaller businesses.  Ireland is made up of an awful lot of businesses where there are one, two, three, five or ten employees.  Those businesses are really struggling, as I already outlined, with the extra basic costs on them today.  If it is working in places like Norway and has been proven to work, why not further examine it?  The Minister said it does not merit being further looked at.

Even the Government, as well as members of the Opposition, had to laud the contribution of workers who are often very on very low pay, relative to some of the very high earners in our country.

That is what we propose to increase.  We are not talking about hitting the family home.<\/p><p>We are talking about hitting the additional wealth people have beyond that.  I am not quite sure what Deputy Nash is saying, but I am a bit surprised by it.  Let us put it this way; the contribution of workers through tax and USC went through the roof, relatively speaking, after 2007.  If I remember correctly, workers were paying approximately &euro;13 billion in tax, pre-crash.  It is now up to &euro;27 billion.  The big jump happened as a result of the USC, which has never been rolled back.  We have, in effect, turned an emergency tax into a permanent tax.  Every worker in this country will tell one how angry he or she is to see the little brackets around USC printed on their pay packet and the big lump of money taken out by it.  I do not believe there is ever justification for the USC but, to my mind, there is no justification now given the fact we are out of the emergency used to justify it and workers are, proportionately speaking, making a much larger tax contribution than corporations or people at the very top who are so wealthy they can make money just from having money.  That money continues to grow.<\/p><p> The Minister is correct in his point about our high income social charge only replacing some of the universal social charge but, as I said in my introduction, the proposal we are making intersects with a number of other proposals we will come to in other amendments that will make up the difference.  We are proposing, for example, new bands of income tax for those earning more than &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000, &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000, which would raise approximately &euro;3.8 billion.  We would not only get the money the abolition of the universal social charge would lose us, but more when it is combined with the higher income social charge.  It would probably get to the sort of figures the Minister mentioned when he asked what could be done to make it cost neutral.  The sort of thing one would have to do is significantly increase the income tax contribution of those earning in excess of &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000 and so on.  <\/p><p> By the way, it is again worth saying, and this is a point the Labour Party and others on the left should appreciate, that 20 or 30 years ago it was commonplace to have that level of taxation on higher incomes in the top couple of deciles.  There were Labour Party leaders who talked about things such as taxing the rich until the pips squeaked.  That was commonplace on the left, but it seems we have rowed back from it.  The left should not row back from that, as is clear when one looks at people like Thomas Piketty who has studied these things.  I know the Minister, fair play to him, has read Piketty so he knows how the accumulation and concentration of incomes and wealth have occurred since the onset of neoliberal economic orthodoxies.  To my mind, it is just old-fashioned left-wing politics but it is justified now more than even when one sees the high concentrations of wealth, income and profits at the top compared with the burden working people are suffering from.<\/p><p> When one thinks about our inability to retain and recruit workers across a number of key areas, whether it is in the health service, construction, education and all sorts of sectors, and talks to young people, they will say they are leaving in droves, and are considering leaving, because it is not worth their while living here.  Their after-tax income just cannot allow them to live a decent life here whereas, if they go to Australia, Canada or elsewhere, they can.  The income they will get in those countries will allow them to live a decent-quality life.  We have to address that.  Perhaps Deputy Nash, the Minister or others do not agree with my particular prescription but we need to start to look at this.  That is the point about these amendments.  We need to start to take seriously what is a legitimate and valid argument about wealth redistribution.  I do not think we do that.  We tend to operate on a budget-to-budget basis, tweaking this and reacting to this, that and the other thing, but we are not looking at a more strategic debate about how we redistribute wealth and income on a basis that will allow us to have a sustainable and equitable economy in the future.  I will not delay the meeting any further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#D01100","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>This is not the kind of discussion I thought we would have today, but it is useful and something we should probably take elsewhere.  The discussion will continue because it is a necessary debate to have.  We want to achieve the same things as Deputy Boyd Barrett, but we want to start from a different departure point.  That would be fair to say.  I never like to describe tax as a burden.  That is the language of the right, if I can use that term.  Tax is not a burden.  It is required to contribute to the kind of public services we aspire to have in this country.  That is what the universal social charge system does.  It is the most progressive form of taxation ever introduced in this country and the vast bulk of lower-paid workers do not pay any USC whatsoever.  They also pay very low levels of PRSI and personal tax.<\/p> <p>  I appeal to Deputy Boyd Barrett not to get into the argument about tax cuts and how that can contribute to rising incomes.  We contribute to rising incomes by, for example, empowering our collective bargaining system to ensure workers get a greater share of the pie in terms of their productivity.  We know, and the Deputy knows, that has been falling considerably year-on-year since the 1970s because of the kind of economic system that has been prevalent across the world.  The USC is, by definition, a very progressive tax system and we ought to be very careful about how we approach any adjustments we make to it.<\/p> <p>  The best way of ensuring that working people have a decent standard of living is by providing universal basic public services to a very high standard.  We know that in this country general levels of Government expenditure on public investment, pre-pandemic, were low and need to improve.

He is arguing not just for the reduction of a tax but for its complete abolition below a certain level.

I say this to him with respect, but also with as much sincerity as he offers in making his views known to me.<\/p> <p>  I believe that it is important we ask those who can afford to make a contribution to the cost of public services in our country to do so.  While I accept and understand, to use Deputy Healy-Rae's analogy, that the purse and wallet of many are under real pressure at the moment, we should reacquaint ourselves with the way in which the USC is structured and designed, which is to ask those who earn more to pay more.  The figures speak for themselves.  Somebody in the PAYE sector earning between &euro;12,012 and &euro;21,295 pays 2%.  Someone earning more than &euro;100,000 per year, or &euro;70,044 per year, in the PAYE sector pays four times that or 8%. <\/p> <p>  This is a progressive tax.

I appreciate the constructiveness with which Deputy Healy-Rae has put his argument forward, but if we put into a Finance Bill a report to the effect that we will look at doing something, the rest of the world will look at that and assume it will happen.  That is not a signal that we should be sending at the moment.  One of the reasons I believe that is because of another issue that we will begin to debate as the afternoon goes on, namely, the change in corporate tax policy.<\/p><p> To deal with the point that Deputy Boyd Barrett made regarding trying to find ways in which large companies should pay more, look at what is happening at the moment, namely, a large and historic OECD agreement on this matter into which Ireland has taken an important decision to enter and to make the case for.

To move forward with a further increase in the taxation of any company on top of what we are doing in entering an OECD agreement would be a danger to the jobs and investment in our country.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the figures that Deputy Boyd Barrett cited in making his case to me, he made the point that gross profits amounted to &euro;203.8 billion.  However, the same table concludes that the taxable income of the companies is &euro;106.4 billion.  Given that this is a debate that the Deputy and I have had for years, I know the next line in his argument is that he will describe as mostly tax avoidance the change between &euro;203.8 billion and &euro;106.4 billion.  I would say that it was due to the use of allowances that form a normal part of corporate tax codes all over the world.  If we begin with a starting point of &euro;104.6 billion, then a payment of &euro;10.9 billion in tax over that taxable income is an effective tax rate of 10.2%.  While it is lower than our current 12.5%, it is still closer enough to it than using the larger profit base of &euro;203.8 billion.<\/p> <p>  To indicate at this time that Ireland was going to do more than the OECD agreement in terms of how we tax larger companies would be dangerous for our economy.

We do not believe in taxing the family home because it is not the same as wealth that is additional to that, for example, multiple properties, large landholdings, large holdings of shares, large amounts of cash in the bank, etc.  Those are two different types of wealth, particularly in a country where 70% of people own their own homes.  I suspect that is where our approach to these matters differs from the Labour Party's, but we stand over it and do not believe that people should be punished for managing to own a family home, particularly where the State has failed so badly in the provision of social housing and the fear of homelessness or paying extortionate rents often drives people towards trying to purchase their own homes.  They work hard and struggle to achieve that only to get landed with regressive further taxes on something that they have already paid for using income on which they have already paid a great deal of tax.  That is our view.<\/p> <p>  It is with this in mind that our proposal on a wealth tax comes about.  At the end of the first quarter of 2021, net household wealth - that is after debts, liabilities and so on - was &euro;883 billion, an increase of &euro;89 billion in just one year.  That was an extraordinary increase over 2020, which was the year of the pandemic.  Tying into Deputy Nash's point, the &euro;883 billion includes &euro;400 billion in financial assets.  That is a lot of financial assets.  I do not have the exact figures in front of me, but the bottom 50% have only 1.4% of all the wealth whereas the top 10% have 53% of the wealth.<\/p><p>It is self-evident when we are talking about that amount of wealth, 53%, which is &euro;440 billion, in the hands of about 140,000 people.  Our proposal, just so we are not accused of taxing the family home, is to strip out &euro;1 million for those 140,000 people but we are still left with hundreds of billions of euro concentrated in the hands of that group.  We are proposing a very modest 2% tax on the value of that wealth and assets.  Frankly, they would not feel it but it would generate a lot of revenue.<\/p><p> Wealth taxes are commonplace in many other jurisdictions.  They were more commonplace 20 or 30 years ago and I think it is regressive that countries have moved away from wealth taxes, although some countries still have them and some have actually introduced them in the context of Covid as a sort of solidarity effort to try to redistribute some of the wealth and income.  It is a reasonable thing to do.  Our proposal goes slightly further than other proposals for wealth taxes that groups like the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, have proposed over the years.  Why would we not at least discuss the possibility of a wealth tax when it is done elsewhere?  We can discuss the fairness of it and have a national debate about that inequality in the distribution of wealth and to what extent it could contribute a lot more money to the revenue for the public services that we all agree we need.  I do not see why we would not want to have that debate.  I do not apologise for pressing to have that debate every single year because, eventually, we will have that debate, in my opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#F01200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>On the amendment, I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that we need to have a conversation and a debate in regard to wealth taxes.

Just yesterday, I was knocking on doors in an estate beside my own estate, and one thing that came back clearly from people is that they are seeing their costs rise and rise.  Many people are struggling because they have not seen their income rise in any way, shape or form.  However, there are those who have done better out of the pandemic and who, if asked, would be more than willing to pay more to help because they know there needs to be that element of solidarity.<\/p> <p>  While we would probably look at a broader, more comprehensive report in this regard, it is welcome and, in fact, crucial that we start this conversation in regard to a wealth tax and in regard to those who earn more being able to pay more.

I disagree on the need for a wealth tax.  The reason I disagree with it is that, first, we already have a set of wealth taxes in our country - capital acquisitions tax, CAT, capital gains tax, CGT, and DIRT, and one could argue that the local property tax, LPT, is also a form of wealth of tax.  We already have four taxes that perform many of the functions that tend to be associated with the operation of wealth taxes.  In fact, CGT and CAT are set at a rate of 33%, and many of the different analyses that have been done in comparing those taxes with their equivalent taxes in peer countries suggest Ireland has among the highest capital taxes compared with similar countries.  The reason I do not believe there is a need for a further tax on wealth in Ireland is that we have four different taxes that, in their differing ways, perform that role.<\/p> <p>  For those who would still advocate the case for tax beyond that, it begs the question regarding how it would be implemented.  My understanding is that the other European country that recently looked at the role of a wealth tax is France, and France abandoned the use of that tax because of all of the difficulties it had in its implementation.<\/p> <p>  I cannot help but be struck by the contradiction that those who make the case for a wealth tax also oppose the existence of the local property tax and call for its abolition, which means that those who live in mansions would gain the most from the implementation of their policies.  It is the most regressive tax cut advocated by anybody in the Oireachtas.  To argue, on the one hand, that we need a further wealth tax while arguing also for the abolition of the LPT is inconsistency at best.  In addition to the LPT, as I said, we already have CGT, CAT and DIRT, all of which, in effect, play a role in taxing what approximates wealth at a rate that is very high, 33%.<\/p> <p>  That being said, of course, I utterly respect the fact that other colleagues in this committee take a very different view from me on that matter.  I respect why they are making a case for it but I do not believe the place in which we should indicate the role of that debate is in the Finance Bill.  For that reason, I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#G00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>We have had the discussion and we differ, but it is simply not accurate to say that what we are proposing is regressive.  It is just not accurate.  We are very clear in what our proposal is, namely, this wealth tax will target the wealthiest 5%.  By the way, we do not do year-on-year studies of this distribution but they were done by groups like TASC and, at one point, the CSO, which does not seem to do this on a regular basis, as it should.  They both came up with figures that the top 10% had 53% of the wealth and the top 5% had about 37% of the wealth.  We are proposing to design a wealth tax, or at least have a requirement arising out of this Bill that the Government would look into a serious study on how it could design a tax which would be directed at that group of people, excluding the family home.<\/p> <p>  Is it impractical to do it, as the Minister suggests?  Is it very difficult?  We could answer those questions if we seriously looked at the matter but we do not want to look at the matter.  What I do know is that the Central Bank has managed to produce figures on it, so somebody has some information about where the wealth is.  Somebody has that because every single quarter the Central Bank produces its quarterly report and is able to tell us how much household wealth there is and how many liabilities there are.  Also, at various times, although not constantly enough, in my opinion, we have had the CSO and groups like TASC do actual studies of the distribution of that wealth.<\/p> <p>  By the way, their findings are largely in line with other global studies in the western world.  There is a bit of difference here and there but, largely, that inequality in the distribution of wealth is fairly consistent around the western world.  Piketty did a study of it, as the Minister knows very well because he has read the book.<\/p><p>He knows that it is a very definite pattern of concentration of wealth that has accelerated over the past 20 to 30 years and we think that we should seriously look at it and study it.  Then we can answer the question as to whether it would be too difficult to do it.  I do not believe that.  The argument is always made that it is too difficult to tax the rich but it is really easy to tax the workers and that is what we do.  That is unfair and we should at least try to get the facts on it so that we can have an informed debate.  It is simply inaccurate for the Minister to say that what we are proposing is regressive.  The local property tax raises just over &euro;500 million per year.  What we are proposing would raise a hell of a lot more than that, multiples of it, from the people at the top.  They might benefit by a small amount from the abolition of the property tax but what is the highest amount that multimillionaires in mansions pay in property tax?  What is the highest amount being paid?  It is around &euro;1,000 per year.  They might benefit by that amount but under our proposals, they will pay a hell of a lot more on the other side with a wealth tax, although it is still very affordable from their point of view.  They would also, as per an amendment we will be discussing soon, pay an additional property tax on properties other than their principal private residence.  Just for factual accuracy, we are not proposing something that is regressive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#G00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>It is a missed opportunity not to have this report.  The IMF has said that post-pandemic, we should look at a solidarity tax.  In terms of where the conversation is at for a lot of people, it is a missed opportunity not to prepare this kind of report looking at the possibility of a wealth tax.  In 2016 the ESRI prepared a report entitled Scenarios and Distributional Implications of a Household Wealth Tax in Ireland.  That was five years ago so why not consider an updated report now?  The Minister said that it might be difficult to do but it would be up to the authors of the report to look at that.  The report could tell us whether it is unworkable.

This would be something for the report to look at but the conversation is out there now; it is being argued that we need a wealth tax or a solidarity tax.  The Minister said that amendments calling for reports could be interpreted by the outside world as being a policy change rather than just a report but that should not stop us from undertaking these kinds of reports.  Of course, I would like to see a wealth tax implemented but I do not think that should stop us from doing these kinds of reports.  It is absolutely imperative that we do so and there is an onus on us, as members of this committee, to commission a report to see if such a tax is workable.

It is important to be clear that we live in a country in which the top 1% of taxpayers pay just under one quarter of all of the income tax and USC collected.  That is a progressive tax code in operation.  That is a tax code under which the more income one has, the more tax one pays.  In making his point, Deputy Boyd Barrett referenced a report by the Central Bank.  It is one thing to produce the figures but it is an entirely different matter to look at how a tax can be effectively implemented.  Even with that point in mind, let us look at what the constituents of that wealth could be that are captured in the report to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred.  If that wealth is captured in the value of a home, the individual pays the local property tax.  If it is captured in the value of savings and those savings earn interest, the individual pays DIRT tax.  If it is captured in a financial instrument of some kind, when that financial instrument is sold or is the subject of a transaction, the individual pays tax at that point.  If it is wealth that is inherited from one generation to another, the individual pays tax at that point as well.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons I oppose the policy that is being put forward, as I said in my opening statement, is that in effect we have taxes in place already that perform some of the role of the tax being proposed by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.

This committee has the resources that it needs and it makes good use of same and I am sure it could look at commissioning a report in this area.  Given that Ireland has just made a decision to enter into an OECD agreement that commits us to a minimum effective tax rate, I am not going to include signals in our Finance Bill that indicate that very big changes are coming on the taxation of people and their income which would undermine the competitiveness of our country and undermine our ability to attract and keep wealth and jobs in Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#H00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>We have had the discussion and the Minister is essentially saying that we will scare the horses of investment.

While I never really expected that the Minister would take on board the wealth tax or our more far-reaching proposals on corporate tax, this is one that should be considered.  This amendment seeks to have a report prepared, and ultimately implemented, on getting rid of the tax on the family home and replacing it with a tax on multiple properties.<\/p><p>This amendment makes a distinction, which the Government wilfully refuses to make when we discuss wealth because it wants to collapse the distinction between those who own family homes and people who own two, three, four, five, ten, 15, 20, 30, 50 or 100 properties.  There is a world of difference between those two types of property owners.  The family home, by and large, is not an asset to generate wealth for the people who live in it.  It is a roof to put over their heads when access to housing is a concern for people, particularly when we are in the teeth of a housing crisis, although it always has been a concern for people.  There is a distinction between that and people who rent out properties and profit from doing so.  This amendment proposes a property tax that excludes the family home but imposes a &euro;1,000 tax on a second home, &euro;1,500 per home if one has three to ten homes and &euro;2,500 per home if one has ten or more.<\/p><p> When we consider the enormous rents being charged and the inflation in property values, to which Deputy Nash referred, which is part of the rise in household wealth - although it is also financial, something to which I pointed - that concentration of wealth where it has grown exponentially constitutes serious wealth for people who have two, five, ten, 15 or 20 homes.  Those people are making money by virtue of the fact that they own many properties.  We are proposing a very modest measure to remove the regressive burden on people who may have low incomes and are paying property tax on the value of their principal private residences and to replace it with a tax on second or further homes on an escalating basis depending on how much property one owns.  According to our costing of this proposal based on the ready reckoner the Department provides, if implemented, it would raise the money to cover the loss in revenue on foot of the removal of the current property tax levied on family homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#H00900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I call the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#J00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Apologies, Chairman, I had my hand raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#J00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Apologies, Deputy, please proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#J00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Sometimes it is easier to intervene at this point.

If the Minister&rsquo;s proposals in that regard were to be effective, which I do not believe they will be, that would not be an issue.  In the world that we would want to construct around the rental sector, we would introduce rental controls where that could not happen.  Therefore, landlords would not be able to pass on the cost.  We would reset rents at affordable levels through a rent authority that would set rents at an affordable level.  That particular criticism does not concern us.

One would not end up paying a lot more under our proposal because one would not be paying tax on the principal residence.  One would pay &euro;1,000 in tax on that second property but that is not punitive.  It is fairer.

Yet again, what Deputies Boyd Barrett and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell are proposing is a narrowing of our tax base.  In the circumstances in which this tax is being proposed, three things could happen.  First, the property owner could pay the higher rate of tax on the non-family home the Deputy refers to.  Second, the property owner could pass as much of that as possible on to his or her tenants until he or she hits the cap in rent increases that the Government has in place.  Third, he or she could decide that owning multiple properties is not worth the additional cost and end up exiting the private rental sector.

Leaving those arguments aside for a moment, I would make the point that this is exactly the same as what the Deputy has proposed in looking to get rid of a large chunk of the universal social charge.  It would narrow the tax base, which is exactly the kind of thing we were all warned against doing in the aftermath of the crisis a decade ago.  That is what the Deputies' measures would do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#K00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#K00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#K00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:  \t<b>&ldquo;Employment status determinations<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>3.<\/b>Where, in applying any provision of the Principal Act the question arises as to whether an individual who personally executes any work or service for a person is an employee of that person or is self-employed or is employed by another person:<br \/><br \/>(a) an agreement, decision, transaction, course of action or conduct or arrangement purporting to define or govern the individual&rsquo;s status, or to evidence the belief or intention of the individual or of other persons in relation to that status, is not conclusive;<br \/><br \/>(b) the question&mdash; <blockquote> \t(i) shall be determined by identifying the actual relations between the parties, and the relevant conditions and circumstances attaching to those relations,<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>(ii) shall, if the form of any agreement or arrangement between the parties is inconsistent with the substance of those relations, be based on the substance; <\/blockquote>(c) any perceived advantage or disadvantage to a party or parties arising from the determination, in relation to&mdash; <blockquote> \t(i) liability to tax or to social insurance contributions, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) the applicability of enactments or rules of law for the protection of employees, shall, save to the extent that it may provide a motive for misrepresenting the true nature of the arrangement, be disregarded; <\/blockquote>and<br \/><br \/>(d) the fact that the agreement under which the individual works is made between the person and a third person may, if the functions of the third person in relation to the arrangement are matters of form only and not of substance, be disregarded.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#K00600","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Before Deputy Nash speaks to the amendment I want to point out that I have to rush off to do something but my amendment No. 9 on the special assignee relief programme, SARP, is coming up.

This particular instance was brought to my attention by the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association and I belatedly forwarded the Minister some correspondence on this to give him some context on Revenue's approach to these issues.  Bogus self-employment is alive and well in a number of economic sectors but it is particularly prevalent, according to the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, in aviation.  It estimates that up to 5,000 pilots registered under corporate entities here over the last decade or so have been engaged or are still engaged through what are known as intermediary structures.  The Minister will know what intermediary structures are.<\/p> <p>  The fact of the matter is that a significant number of pilots operating in the Irish market are given a Hobson's choice by the airline that engages them.  One can work with an airline as a pilot but pilots and those in personal services companies have to create company structures to allow them to work for particular airlines.  One must set up a structure to hire oneself to a firm and the firm then has an arm's length relationship with that person.  The pilots themselves would portray all the characteristics of direct employees.  They look after their own tax affairs, including PRSI and so on, even though the airline itself is, for all intents and purposes, the employer.  As I said at the outset, this practice is prevalent in Ireland.  This is one of few countries in the European Union, and maybe the only one, that operates these kinds of structures and where the tax authority does not have the capacity to look through these kinds of arrangements.<\/p> <p>  The almost exclusive purpose of these company structures is to misrepresent or misclassify the employment status of the pilot or the individual employer, regardless of what the sector might be.  However, Revenue says that it has no power to look through these personal services company structures as they are generally described.  This has a significant impact.  The 2018 report from Revenue and the Department of Social Protection shows that these arrangements have a significant impact on reductions in PRSI, in revenue to the Social Insurance Fund and in revenue to the Exchequer more generally through taxes.  It is quite extraordinary that the Revenue Commissioners says it does not have any function in looking through these companies.<\/p> <p>  When one looks under the bonnet of these relationships one sees that they are designed to misrepresent the classification of the employee.  They also deny revenue to the State because of these complicated structures and the masking of the actual and real relationship between the employer and the employee.  These arrangements are matters of form and not substance and it is high time that the Revenue Commissioners had a clear function in determining that relationship and had the power in law to carry out investigations of these kinds of structures.  As the Minister will know, it is a matter for the scope section of the Department of Social Protection to determine employment status.<\/p><p>When so much tax revenue is at stake because of these structures one would imagine that the Revenue Commissioners would have a role in investigating these structures and determining whether they are lawful or not.  It is up to us as a Parliament to define whether these arrangements are lawful or not.  I proposed this particular amendment to give powers to Revenue to investigate these types of structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#K01600","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Far be it from me to try to undertake the role of Chairman, but I think Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell wants to come in at this point.

I am not sure how comfortable I am about moving in on the big screen, but we are where we are.<\/p> <p>  I welcome this amendment.  I commend Deputy Nash on bringing forward this amendment on bogus self-employment, which we know is occurring in many areas.  As highlighted by Deputy Nash, it is happening in the aviation sector, the construction sector, the food delivery sector in terms of the Deliveroo service, the taxi sector and so on.  It was reported to the Committee of Public Accounts recently that up to &euro;1 billion is being lost annually owing to bogus self-employment.  Research by ICTU indicated that the loss could be approximately &euro;600 million.  This is a huge amount of money in the context of the discussions we have had on earlier amendments.  That this amount of money is being lost to the Exchequer is a massive issue.  It is high time we got serious about tackling it.<\/p> <p>  On a related point, we hear often about the pensions timebomb and people being asked or forced to work for longer or until they are older.  If we are losing out on up to &euro;1 billion or, as stated by ICTU, &euro;600 million, we need to tackle this matter.  In my view, addressing bogus self-employment is crucial for fairness for people.  In discussing the pensions timebomb we should be focused on the bogus self-employment issue in terms of bringing in additional finances to deal with demographic changes and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#L00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>While I appreciate the importance of the issue which the Deputies raise, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  The question of employment for self-employment status arises in three different areas, that is, tax where it is determined by Revenue, social welfare where it is determined by the Department of Social Protection and employment rights where the Workplace Relations Commission makes the determination.  <\/p><p>It must be borne in mind that a worker&rsquo;s employment status is not a matter of choice; it depends on the terms and conditions of the job.  While it is usually clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed, it is not always obvious.  However, case law has established tests to determine whether contracts are contracts for service, that is, self-employed contractors or contracts of service, that is, an employee.  These tests need to be applied on a case-by-case basis to the facts of each case.  In July of this year, the three organisations I mentioned earlier, that is, Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Workplace Relations Commission, published a code of practice which now includes legal tests used to determine employment status.  The code states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhile the terms of a contract might be quite clear in saying that a person is engaged as a self-employed contractor, courts and statutory bodies may still conclude that they are, in fact, an employee.  Inspectors and adjudicators will consider any formal contracts, but they will also consider how the work is actually carried out and will assess the relationship between the worker providing the service and the business paying for that service.  They will consider whether the worker, or indeed the employer, had no option but to sign up to the terms dictated by the other party.  The true agreement will often only be understood by analysing in the round all the circumstances and facts of the case. <\/blockquote> <p>The code of practice highlights that there is no single, clear legal definition of &quot;employment&quot; or &quot;self-employment&quot; under EU or Irish law and also emphasises that &quot;the reality behind the contract&quot; is what determines employment status.  It is my understanding that it is that idea of the reality behind the contract that Deputy Nash is referencing where he refers to &quot;a look through&quot;.  The code aims to be of benefit to employers, employees, independent contractors and legal, financial and HR professionals.  It is also aimed at investigators, decision-makers and adjudicators in the Department of Social Protection, the Workplace Relations Commission, Revenue, their respective appeals bodies and the courts. <\/p><p>It is important to ensure that workers are correctly classified in a way that matches the reality of the relationship between the worker and the business.  The choice of business model should not serve to exclude any worker from his or her proper entitlements.  The misclassification of a worker as being self-employed when the terms and conditions mean that in reality he or she is an employee is a matter of concern.  Misclassification reduces contributions to the Social Insurance Fund and excludes workers from their rights and protections.  <\/p><p>I believe, therefore, that the newly developed code of practice achieves what this proposed amendment apparently seeks and I do not consider the amendment necessary for that reason.  In addition, the code is described as a &quot;living document&quot;, which will continue to be updated to reflect future, relevant changes in the labour market, relevant legislation and case law.  This is a better way to ensure that the appropriate tests are applied rather than codifying them in legislation which will inevitably need updating over time and may be more unwieldy to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#L00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I understand why he might not accept the amendment.  The new code of practice is at an early stage in terms of its operation.  There is no doubt about that.  Some of the changes made represent an improvement on the previous code of practice that showed over the past few years that it was no longer worth the paper it was written on.  That is based on the direct experience of workers and trade unions who were using it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister and I will have a difference of opinion on this but we need to move beyond reliance on codes of practice in this space.  In recent years, bogus self-employment, especially in cities, has become a feature of the labour market in this country.  We will end up regretting that in the coming years.  My view, generally speaking, is that employment status should become a matter of law, as is the case in some of the countries against which we like to compare ourselves.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been requested to get involved.  Bid-rigging is a process whereby bidders for public work contracts co-ordinate bids to keep them at artificially high prices.  Bogus self-employment ties into this over-inflated cost for public works in that the larger contractors that engage in bid-rigging are able to submit lower tender bids because they save around 30% in labour costs through the avoidance of PRSI.<\/p><p>It has a knock-on effect on public works being carried out.  I understand that Dublin City Council also expressed concern about the high prices it was having to pay for homes in Dublin city, which could also be attributed to this so it might have a knock-on effect on that too.

Third, Revenue has a dedicated division that now looks at the shadow economy and includes within that issues with relation to the classification of employment contracts.  The Department of Social Protection also now has a dedicated unit which looks at the misclassification of employment contracts.  In Revenue's letter on this matter, it concludes by noting the power available to it to initiate compliance interventions, and we know what that means.

The structure of families has changed and many people choose not to marry and they cohabit with their partner for long periods.<\/p> <p>  I will also mention a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, which was ruled out of order, on the incapacitated child, as it is quite important.  For parents of an incapacitated child, there is a statistical likelihood that the child will not have any or much income from employment over the course of his or her life.  It is likely that such children will depend on the means-tested disability allowance for their whole life and exclusive dependence on that means a life below the poverty line and a high likelihood of enforced deprivation.  Parents will do their very best to supplement that and give them a better quality of life and they want to do everything possible to continue that after they pass away.  If parents do manage to save money to give to their child, and the child simply inherits that, it could result in the child losing their disability allowance.  However, if the inheritance is left to a special needs trust rather than to the child directly, the child will not lose the allowance because he or she does not legally own the asset in the trust.  The problem is that establishing a special needs trust for the child is onerous and costly.  You need to get and pay for both financial and legal advice.  My colleague, Deputy Doherty, spoke to Revenue on this some years ago.  It impressed on him the importance of doing that but it would not give clear and categoric direction on who the trustees could be, that is, how far from the immediate family they must be removed.  It just kept saying that the parents should engage legal and financial expertise themselves.  However, there is huge ambiguity on this point.  We have received conflicting advice from Citizens Information, Revenue, and from financial advisers where there has been a payout resulting from legal claims, such as medical negligence or a car crash where the sums involved can be huge.  The costs of advisers and the trust itself can be negligible relatively speaking.  However, where the parents might themselves be dependent on carer's allowance, putting what they can aside each month, the costs involved in this kind of financial planning, retaining professionals, and the trust itself are a massive problem for people.  I wanted to raise that.  I know that the specific amendment is out of order but it is a really important point because there are a lot of families who are struggling. <\/p> <p>  I support Deputy Nash's amendment, which is interesting and a sign of changing times.

Since they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to another.  As part of the tax strategy group, TSG, process last year, the tax treatment of couples was considered.  The TSG paper on income tax included an overview of the tax treatment of couples and outlined the rationale for the different treatment of married couples and cohabiting couples.<\/p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v<\/i>. Attorney General.  This decision was based on Article 41.3.1&deg; of the Constitution, in which the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  This decision led to the income tax treatment of married couples in operation today.  The constitutional protection of Article 41.3.1&deg; does not extend to non-married couples.<\/p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances, while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.  As such, I note that any changes in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development regarding such couples. <\/p><p>There would be legal issues with regard to so-called connected persons.  To counter tax avoidance, connected persons are frequently defined throughout the various tax Acts.  The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  This could be difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple does not have legal recognition.  There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits.  However, the legal status for married couples has wider consequences, from a tax perspective, both for themselves and persons connected with them. <\/p><p>I also note that the difference in tax treatment for married couples is not confined to income tax and is also a feature of other tax heads, such as capital acquisitions tax.  Any changes, therefore, in the tax treatment could only be considered in the broader context of the tax system and future social and legal policy development, given that the legal status of married couples has wider consequences than from a tax perspective.  That is the reason I am not in a position to accept this amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#N00100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Where non-members of the committee have tabled an amendment, they can call a vote but cannot participate in it.

This section in general deals with the issue of people working from home.  It provides for a formalisation of the tax arrangements for employees who are working from home.  This means that from 1 January 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and internet services income can be claimed, apportioned on the basis of the number of days worked.<\/p> <p>  While I welcome the moves to encourage and facilitate working from home arrangements, I have a few questions and comments on this section.  I want to tease this out a bit because many people who are working from home are dealing with increased costs.  I am not opposing the section; I just want to tease it out.  I am interested to hear the Minister's view on the points I wish to raise.  Some businesses provide equipment to employees to enable home working.  For example, I previously worked in a bank which made laptops available to employees.  The cost to businesses of items such as computers or office furniture qualify for a deduction through the capital allowances regime but in this Bill, there is no provision to allow workers to claim a tax deduction for expenditure on equipment used for remote working purposes.  There is also no provision to extend relief to desk hire in remote working hubs.  I ask the Minister to explain the rationale for this.  I am very interested to hear his view on the matter.  It should also be noted that the process for claiming the deduction can be quite burdensome.  Recent figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that only one in ten remote workers claimed the relief.  I ask the Minister to consider changing the relief to ensure that applications and claims are easier to make.  Of course, it could be the case that many people are not aware of the relief and that raising it here might improve awareness but it does seem that the application process is quite burdensome for many.<\/p> <p>  The cost of this relief is being borne by the taxpayer and the State.  The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council has prepared a report on the potential savings that may arise for employers from remote working.  It finds that a move away from large scale headquarters in expensive city centre locations not only provides cost savings for firms in terms of office rental or acquisition, it also potentially reduces related costs like electricity, lighting, heating, cleaning and catering.  A lot of businesses and companies are moving towards remote working or a hybrid model.  Despite these savings, the State is bearing the cost of remote working.  I am not saying that I am against these provisions but I wish to tease out the issues involved.<\/p> <p>  In Portugal, new laws require employers with more than ten employees to share the cost of remote working.  Does the Minister accept that with this measure we are giving employers a bit of a free pass in view of the fact that in some instances they will benefit financially from the shift to remote working?  It could be argued that workers who cannot work from home, like nurses and other front-line workers, cannot avail of such arrangements and are subsidising, through the tax system, working from home arrangements for those who potentially earn higher incomes.  I also want to raise the fact that there is no tax relief for travelling expenses incurred by workers travelling to their place of work.  Does the Minister accept that there is an issue of equity in terms of enhancing tax relief for workers working from home without addressing the costs incurred by those who do not have that option?  Will he agree to a wider review of travel and subsistence reimbursements in that context, including the costs that should potentially be borne by employers?<\/p> <p>  I did not get the opportunity to speak on amendment No. 9, which relates to SARP, because it was not moved.  I welcome the calls for a report on SARP.  We often hear that the programme is necessary in order to attract top talent or retain existing talent, but the burden of proof is left with the employer that is actually benefiting from this tax subsidy.  Why not give Revenue the opportunity to seek proof from employers and employees or would-be employees that the presence of SARP was the determining factor for employees who also received job offers in other jurisdictions?  I would be quite surprised if that could be demonstrated.  It is unfortunate that amendment No.9 will not be voted on today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#P00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I will deal with the questions the Deputy has put to me about remote working, which is the subject of this section.  Overall, employers should bear the cost of providing the equipment that their employees need to work from home.  The employer would have to provide that equipment and those facilities anyway were the work to be taking place in a work environment, inside an office or a formal workplace.  The issues of equity that the Deputy touched on a moment ago would rise to a far higher level if we ended up in a situation where the taxpayer was subsidising employers for costs that in the pre-pandemic area were borne in their entirety by employers, albeit that they would have been able to claim recognition of them as a business expense.  We have to get the balance right in our tax code in terms of how we recognise all of this.  In situations where work is transitioning from happening in an office to happening at home, it is up to the employer to bear most, if not all, of the costs involved.  We would end up in a situation where there were real issues of equity if taxpayers were to take over responsibility for a whole set of costs that a short while ago they were not bearing at all.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether I believe this raises equity issues for those who are not working at home but are bearing some of the costs of providing support for those who are working from home, we must put the issue into the round.  My officials will give me an exact figure presently, but the total cost associated with this measure is a very low share of all of the tax that we collect.  In that context, the equity issues are not particularly pronounced given that the cost of this scheme overall is not very big.  On the question of whether we should be subsidising travel costs associated with going to and coming from work, we should not do any more beyond the recognition that we currently give through things like benefit-in-kind relief.  In fact, in a world where we are trying to help and encourage those who can travel less to do so, providing additional tax recognition of journey time would not be consistent with that goal.  I think I have addressed all of the issues the Deputy has raised on this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#P00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>For clarity, I am not suggesting that the taxpayer bear the cost of equipment.

The truth is that time will tell.  Time will tell whether enough taxpayers believe that the benefit they can see by registering for this relief is worth the effort.  I hope that even by having this discussion and the prominence it got on budget day, that more taxpayers will be aware of the relief that is available to them.  I note that one way of claiming this that perhaps has so far not gotten the publicity that it might merit, is that the ability is now there to make the client claims in real time.  All that would involve somebody doing is having a look at their utility and broadband bills, taking a photo of the bill and uploading the photo to the receipts tracker app.  This is a well-established way of making claims for, for example, health expenses.  It will not come as much of an inconvenience to any taxpayer who wants to claim this relief. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#Q00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I revert to the point I made about Portugal.

Some employers will be saving huge amounts of money because they will not have to pay the rent etc. for massive office buildings in big city centre locations across Galway, Dublin, Limerick etc.  It would be interesting to see if there is a way of including employers in those large companies who are doing better of out of this working from home situation.

It is better off that this is dealt with on an employer-by-employer basis with those who work with them.  We have gone through many months of mass-scale home working without this issue of who pays what raising its head in a significant way.  That speaks to the common sense that is being used by employers all over the country in working this out.  In hundreds of thousands of cases, employees of companies took their laptops home, changed an arrangement at home and managed to work that out with their employer.  We have managed to get this far into this phase of Covid-19 without those particular kinds of issues becoming difficult for a large number of employers.<\/p> <p>  For what it is worth, without going too far off the Finance Bill, I am not so sure that we will see the mass change in office space that we would have speculated might happen a while ago.  In many cases, employees will still want to go back into the office.  They may want to go back in for considerably less than five days a week.  We are going to see offices move away from where there are many offices and workspaces to where there are meeting rooms and collaborative areas.  That will involve using the same space, but in a different way.  That is already happening.  Employers are looking at how they change existing office space to make it a place where their employees want to come in, and to make it into a genuinely collaborative space, as opposed to a place where an employee comes in to do his or her email.

Trying to bilocate in here can be difficult at times.  The amendment which I had hoped to move related to this section.  It was amendment to look at the special assignee relief programme.  This is one of the most egregious tax breaks that is given to some of the highest earners in this country.  Many people are not aware of it but it really sticks in the craw of any ordinary worker who becomes of aware of the fact that there is a specially designed relief on income tax, which you only get if you earn more than &euro;75,000 per year.  The thought of that is in and of itself to me mind-boggling, that is, that there is a tax relief that you can only get if you earn approximately twice the average industrial wage.  Included in that is the relief for paying fees for private schooling and for trips abroad, or home, in the case of foreign executives who are on these earnings.  It is well worth saying that while the threshold for being eligible for special assignee tax relief is that one has to earn more than &euro;75,000, the recipients of this relief earn, in many cases, a hell of a lot more than that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister sent us some recent figures.  I have figures from a reply to a parliamentary question that I asked earlier.  The Minister might give us the updated figures.  They are quite extraordinary.  In 2016 there were 95 recipients of the relief who earned between &euro;375,000 and &euro;675,000.<\/p><p>There were 26 recipients who earned between &euro;670,000 and &euro;1 million.  For this year, if I remember the figures correctly, 50 people who earn in excess of &euro;1 million will get this relief.  Anybody who hears about this is gobsmacked.  It is lucky for the Government that most people do not know about it.  If they did, they would be enraged.  People need to know about it, which is why I am keen it be highlighted as part of the debate on the Finance Bill.  There should be a review of it and I hope at the end of that we would decide it is unconscionable and unjustifiable.<\/p><p> The Minister will say that this brings executives in and Government policy is at least consistent in being all about executives and owners of some of the wealthiest multinational corporations in the world.  They feel we would do anything for them.  All the policy measures relating to them add up to the feeling that Ireland is a place that will do anything for them, even giving them tax reliefs on extraordinary salaries that no ordinary worker could dream of getting.<\/p><p> This is an interesting contrast with the universal social charge.  The Minister will say they pay that charge.  I accept that they do, but the idea that 30% of their income over &euro;75,000 up to &euro;1 million would not be taxed is remarkable.  Imagine what it would do for a lot of workers if they got relief at a threshold above, say, &euro;20,000, such that 30% of their income would not be taxed.  They would love it but, unfortunately, it is a privilege only given to people earning more than &euro;75,000 or, in many cases, earning &euro;675,000, &euro;1 million or whatever.<\/p><p> I do not think it is justifiable or necessary.  When you are on that kind of money, do you need tax breaks additional to what everyone else is getting in order to come here?  Those who do must be incredibly greedy if they are on that kind of money and want tax breaks additional to what other people get.  It is important to highlight this matter and to appeal again to the Government to reconsider this grossly unjust tax relief for the highest earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#Q00700","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Whatever justification there may have been for SARP at a different point in our economic cycle, I am not certain of the rationale for the scheme at the moment.

If it is done on an administrative basis, can the political will not be there to provide additional relief for those who have clocked up significant bills working from home this year to reflect the fact that energy, fuel, electricity and heating costs have risen by a huge margin?

I will begin by describing the schemes in place in other countries.  France has an inpatriate allowance which offers a reduction of between 30% and 50% of the remuneration of individuals on the scheme.  Malta has a highly qualified persons scheme that offers a 15% flat rate of tax on all employment income.  The Netherlands has a scheme that offers a 30% tax free allowance.  Italy has a scheme, introduced in 2017, that provides 50% relief.  That scheme was strengthened in 2019 to provide regional incentives.  Portugal has a scheme which offers a 30% reduction in income tax rates for relevant individuals.<\/p> <p>  That is the essential context for this argument.  Other countries we compete with for jobs and investment have equivalent schemes.  It comes back to the argument and debate we had on other matters concerning doing things that can raise questions but which we do because they are part of what allows our country to be competitive and play a valuable role in attracting certain senior decision-makers here to particular companies, which is fundamental to the creation and retention of other jobs.  Consider the list I have read out.  If we get rid of this scheme, it makes what we offer uncompetitive versus the offerings that are there.<\/p> <p>  I have no doubt, despite the enviable consistency of Deputy Boyd Barrett's views and for which I have long praised him, that were any job losses to develop in any of those employers, one of the first people to herald this as the collapse of an economic model would be the Deputy and, no doubt, he would criticise me for it.  I hope his consistency of argument would last at that point but I am not willing to take the risk.<\/p> <p>  The scheme can attract understandable criticism, as it has from the Deputy, but my Department and I go to great lengths to publish information about the scheme on or just after budget day every year.  I take the Deputy's point that, when a scheme confers benefits on people who are already very well paid, there is an additional responsibility on me to make sure it is done in an open and transparent way.  That is why, every year, my Department publishes a report on the operation of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy will remember that a couple of Finance Acts ago, I made changes to the operation of the scheme because, even though it plays a role in retaining and attracting certain kinds of jobs, it should not be done with a disregard to any concerns about equity.  I made changes to the scheme at that point because I wanted to deal with some issues I was becoming concerned about and that needed rectification.  The most recent report that was published indicates there were 379 additional employees, compared with 236 in 2018.<\/p><p>The number of employees retained was 483 compared with 348 the year before.  This combined total of 862 SARP-related jobs in 2019 represented a cost of &euro;44,000 per job created or retained, a decrease in cost per job compared with 2018 when there were 584 at an average cost of &euro;73,000 each.  This represents a decrease in cost of over 39%.  I know it can be complex, at times, to make a case for a scheme like this but it does have a role to play in jobs, corporation tax receipts, PAYE receipts and the association of research and development tax credits here in Ireland because of the individuals who are here.  I remind the committee that in 2019 I commissioned an independent review of the scheme.  It said there was a strong policy rationale for the scheme.  One of the main reasons for that is the existence of comparable schemes in other jurisdictions and the role this scheme plays in allowing us to be competitive versus those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#R00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 12 and 165 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#S00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 12, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Tax credit in respect of MUD construction defect levy payments<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>4.<\/b>(1) Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 114:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t<b>&ldquo;114A. <\/b>(1) In this section&mdash; <blockquote> \t&lsquo;owner-occupier&rsquo; means a person who owns and ordinarily resides in a residential unit in an MUD;<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;MUD&rsquo; means a multi-unit development within the meaning of the Multi-Unit Development Act 2011 (the &lsquo;MUD Act&rsquo;);<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;OMC&rsquo; means an owners&rsquo; management company within the meaning of the MUD Act;<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;construction defect&rsquo; means a defect arising from the design, or workmanship or materials used in the construction, of an MUD,<br \/><br \/>affecting all or a substantial number of units in the MUD;<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;construction defect levy payment&rsquo; means a payment made by an owner-occupier to his or her OMC on foot of a levy imposed by the OMC to remedy a construction defect in the MUD concerned.<br \/><br \/>(2) Where in a year of assessment an owner-occupier, having made a claim in that behalf, proves that, during that year or any of the 15 previous years of assessment, he or she made a construction defect levy payment, he or she shall be entitled to claim a tax credit (a &lsquo;Construction Defects Tax Credit&rsquo;) equal to the value of the levy payment, up to a maximum of &euro;7,500 in respect of any one year in which a levy payment was made.<br \/><br \/>(3) On making a claim under this section, a claimant shall provide to the Revenue Commissioners, through such electronic means as the Revenue Commissioners make available, particulars of the relevant expenses, including&mdash; <blockquote> \t(a) confirmation by the OMC that a construction defects levy payment was made by the owner-occupier during the year in respect of which the claim was made, and<br \/><br \/>(b) such other information as may reasonably be required by the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether the requirements of this section are met. <\/blockquote>(4) Where a tax credit is given under this section to an owner-occupier, no relief or deduction under any other provision of the Income Tax Acts shall be given or allowed in respect of those levy payments.<br \/><br \/>(5) This section shall have effect for the year of assessment 2022 and each subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>Am I right in saying the committee is taking a break at 4 p.m.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#S00500","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#S00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I will be brief then.  The amendment is reasonably self-explanatory.  It has to do with providing tax credits or reliefs for many of those who are paying for levies in terms of defects identified in their apartments.  These apartments would have been built during the so-called boom time period when regulation of the industry was not particularly sound, to put it mildly.  We have a situation where those who are in the business of being landlords, institutional investors and others have the opportunity in the course of their business to claim against or write off tax against some of the work they may be required to do to bring apartments up to standard.  The reliefs which may be available to them are not available to ordinary apartment owners.  There is a clear injustice there.  It is estimated up to 92,000 apartments built during the boom could be affected by defects ranging from a lack of fire-stopping material to rotting balconies and collapsing roof canopies.  Some people are facing bills, we are told, of up to &euro;60,000.  This amendment requests the Minister to provide in this Bill for a modest form of relief on levies.  It is fair and reasonable and I hope the committee takes that view also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#S00700","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Just for clarity, I will be speaking on both No. 12 and No. 165.  The latter is the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  We are all acutely aware of the issues with mica and pyrite and how people are affected by them.  We have long argued for the Government to hold those responsible for defects to account and to implement a redress scheme that supports those affected.  It is something my colleagues, Deputy Doherty, and our housing spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, have repeated time and again.  The mission statement of that scheme should be that ordinary owners who purchased in good faith should not be liable for the costs of remediation caused by the incompetence, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others.  That is why a redress scheme for those affected by mica, pyrite and fire safety defects should require a contribution from those responsible, be they developers, construction companies or financial institutions.  That is why amendment No. 165 should be accepted.<\/p><p>I note the provisions of No. 12.  They mirror the proposals by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who, in his book <i>Defects: Living with the Legacy of the Celtic Tiger<\/i>calls for a redress scheme that also provides some form of retrospective relief for owners who have already covered the cost of remediating their homes.  This should be done by allowing these homeowners to write off the capital costs of remediation against their future tax liabilities over a number of years, as is currently the case for landlords.  Amendment No. 12 is prescriptive that we need a scheme that works.  That is why I ask that the Minister, if he does not accept those amendments as he should, report back within six months on the introduction of a redress scheme, including provision for levies to claw back costs from those responsible.  <\/p><p>On the mica and pyrite scandal, I put on record my disappointment at the divisive strategy emanating from some Departments in recent times.  In many ways it is trying to pit those affected against the general population.  We recently learned that under the National Broadband Plan the taxpayer is paying for over 40,000 premises which will already be covered by Eir at a great cost.  We know also of the cost of the sink that is the National Children's Hospital that continues to swallow money.  We know people have been really affected by this.  We need strong soundings from this finance committee and this Finance Bill in support of these people.  That is why amendments Nos. 12 and 165 should be accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#S00800","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I indicate my support for this amendment.  People who were in multi-unit complexes where there were significant defects related to lack of proper compliance with building and fire safety controls, and who have had to pay large sums of money, should absolutely get some retrospective compensation for that fact.  They, along with the people affected by mica and pyrite, are the victims of cowboy builders who were facilitated by the wild west approach to building development that existed in the Celtic tiger period.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to Noel Manning, who was a slightly obsessive character on the issue of fire safety.  He was an expert on it and used to knock down the doors of many Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  He was always contacting us to point out the almost complete lack of proper fire breaks in buildings from that period in particular.  I remember he took me out to I think, Belarmine, or one of those places on the northside to show me the lack of fire breaks.  It was quite shocking when you saw how this stuff was allowed and that there were not proper controls on it or proper inspections.  The people who bought in good faith ended up picking up the bill for it.  It is outrageous and the Government and the authorities of the time, which allowed it to happen and quite consciously pushed a light-touch regulation policy in that area, are responsible.  They should acknowledge that responsibility to people who suffered very significant financial hits as a result.  These fire safety defects are consistent with those other issues of pyrite and mica and all those affected should get 100% redress.

Addressing amendment No. 12 first, the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment proposes the introduction of a new tax credit for those who have paid construction defect levies to their owners&rsquo; management company up to 15 years ago.  The remediation of defects in housing is a complex problem which has caused great anxiety for ordinary homeowners across the country.  It is the Government&rsquo;s firm intention to find solutions.<\/p> <p>  Non-tax-based supports for homeowners and policy in respect of defects in housing generally are matters primarily for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage rather than the Minister for Finance.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has established an independent working group to examine the issue of defective housing.  Officials from my Department participate in this group.  The objectives of the group are to identify the scope of relevant significant defects in housing; to evaluate the scale of housing affected; to propose a means of prioritising defects; to evaluate the cost of remediation; to recommend appropriate mechanisms for resolving defects; and to consider financing options in line with the programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.<\/p> <p>  I understand that this working group has agreed in its terms of reference to establish the nature of significant, widespread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose-built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  It will consider the wide-ranging and complex issues arising, the nature of the issues, a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.  In these circumstances, the intervention proposed in this amendment seem to be premature and, for that reason, I am not in a position to agree with it.<\/p> <p>  Turning to amendment No. 165, on the introduction of levies against certain financial institutions, construction companies and insurance undertakings to partially fund redress schemes with respect to properties affected by defective blocks, fire safety and other such defects, I will confine my comments to the defective blocks issue as I have already touched on the other issue above.  First, the Government is fully aware of seriousness of the matter and the great distress it is causing to those whose homes are blighted by it, as well as the need to come up with a satisfactory solution.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has reviewed the matter in great detail through the working group it established which reported at the end of September.  Second, the Government is currently working at a very high level to develop an effective solution to this matter.  It would not be appropriate for me to give any indication of the proposals in advance of a Government decision.  Third, the Government is also very conscious of the urgency of the matter and the need to deliver a proposal as soon as possible.  In conclusion, while noting the Deputy&rsquo;s idea of a levy to part fund the costs involved in these proposals, I believe at this stage that a report would be premature.  For that reason, I am not supporting the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#W00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Deputy Conway-Walsh has indicated.

Deputy Doherty and I have corresponded with the Minister.  We had this so-called 90% scheme, which the Government now accepts fell short of what homeowners need to rebuild their lives.  They have done nothing wrong, as the Minister knows.  They are being failed by light-touch regulation, self-regulation, and no regulation.  It is an utter failure.<\/p> <p>  In the case of the pyrite resolution scheme, the Government has accepted this to be the case and therefore redress is required.  The 90% scheme turned out to be anything but that, however.  The banks that we understood would make a contribution just disappeared into the ether.  They were looking to benefit from the crisis rather than assist.  Why should the banks contribute?  Right now, most of those sites, and we are talking about thousands of sites, are worth the site value.  The banks still have mortgage holders and the State is rightly proposing to restore those properties to full market value.  That is a massive boon for the banking sector.  In a recent response by the Minister to a parliamentary question, it is still apparent that he has not engaged with the banking sector on this or on the need to contribute.<\/p> <p>  There are other sectors such as insurance and construction as a whole that could make a contribution.  We have said that the State must ensure 100% redress.  My fear is that senior officials in the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are going to make the same massive mistakes they made a few years ago.  We end up with a scheme that is not 100% at all.  Let us be clear.  The leaks about a &euro;400,000 cap are not at all accurate.  There are also reports of an amount of money per square foot up to 1,700 sq. ft and an amount of money for properties that are over 1,700 sq. ft.  The average single home in Donegal, as it is across the State, is around 2,400 sq. ft.  That means they are not getting 100% redress.  The cap of &euro;400,00 does not apply.  The focus is on what someone will get per square foot to rebuild their home and how that relates to the real price they will pay in the real economy.  As the Minister knows, the families have made a submission to the Government that relies on the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland measurement per square foot or square meter that one should expect to pay.  That is a realistic assessment in the real world of what it would cost to rebuild these homes.  I hope the reports are wrong but they are out there, through journalists, suggesting that there are people in the Minister's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are seeking to do this.  It would be absolutely appalling and unacceptable.  <\/p> <p>  I urge the Minister to deliver this time where there was failure two years ago, namely, on a genuine 100% redress scheme.  I call on him to ask the banking, construction and insurance sectors to make a contribution to it.<\/p><p>There are many ways in which that can be done.  The Minister knows.  His colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, other Ministers, and perhaps even the Taoiseach, are on the record as saying that there needs to be a contribution.  I understand that the Attorney General is working on advice in that regard.  I cannot understand why the amendment is not acceptable to the Minister.  I take this opportunity today to appeal directly to him.<\/p><p> My colleague, Deputy Doherty, also asked that the Minister would meet with the campaigning families, in particular the members of the working group.  He will know who I am talking about: Michael Doherty, Eileen Doherty, Paddy Diver and Ann Owens.  They are the four named persons, and there are other families in Mayo that the Minister should meet.  When he meets with them, he will hear that they are very interested in a cost-effective programme that would also be funded down the line by the sectors I talked about.<\/p><p> In terms of cost-effectiveness, if the Housing Agency oversees the scheme that is now operational in Donegal and Mayo from start to finish, and hopefully will soon be available to families in other counties, as it does with the pyrite resolution scheme, there will be economies of scale.  The difficulty right now is that the Minister is asking families to engage with individual contractors on a much reduced amount of money per square foot than it would realistically cost.  I hope the reports in that regard are not correct.  How does it make sense for families to engage one by one with contractors, compared to the Housing Agency taking over the scheme, as it has done in Dublin and Leinster?  It could take 20 houses that have to rebuilt and ask for a price based on the plans.  In another case, it could ask for a price for 20 houses where the outer leaf might have to be replaced.  There is a European Union tender process so the contractors could come from anywhere in the European Union.  That is where the Minister would get value for money.<\/p><p> There is another way to get value for money.  If there are engineers working on behalf of the State who say to families that they believe the replacement of the outer leaf is what is required, on the basis of having done the tests and examined the compressive strength of the blocks, and the amount of deleterious material &ndash; that could be mica, or pyrite in the case of my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh's county of Mayo &ndash; and they argue that what is required is just to remove the outer leaf, not demolish the whole house, why would the Minister be afraid of giving a State guarantee?  It could be the case that half the families in question just need to remove the outer leaf of their home and that is all they need to do to make their home safe for the rest of their days, and for the generations who will live in the house in the future, so why not give a State guarantee?  The Minister will be aware that there are currently engineers who are operating the existing defective concrete blocks grant scheme who have come together &ndash; they are supported by Engineers Ireland - who say that the only solution in every case is to demolish the entire house.  That is a serious problem for the State in terms of costs.  If there are engineers who are under the umbrella of Engineers Ireland and who believe that it is not the case, then they should speak up.  Where are the voices of engineers who say that is not required?<\/p><p> We were led to understand, based on the National Standards Authority of Ireland's protocol, that not every house is to be demolished.  It had engineering experts and specialists who said that not every house would have to be demolished.  Where are they now?  It is a real problem for the State that there are engineers who say that every house has to be demolished.  I am a layperson and I cannot do it, but if there are engineers who can produce the scientific evidence for the basis of the testing and analysis on which it would be okay to remove the outer leaf, we need to hear their voices.  With those voices there needs to be a State guarantee.  If families have a State guarantee and they have engineers giving them assurances, they will go down that road.  There are a number of ways the State can get control of the cost of the scheme.  I take this opportunity to say directly to the Minister what I know Michael Doherty, Eileen Doherty and others would love to say to him, and to reassure him that they can assist with the process of cost control that the Minister wants to achieve.<\/p><p> I wish to add the role of the banks, the insurance industry and the construction industry in this regard.  This is a national emergency, a national disaster.  The Minister knows that.  This is akin to an earthquake happening in slow motion.  The response to that is, as I have stated, similar to what we saw in the United States, in New Orleans when they had the floods and in California when there were wild fires.  This is a national emergency.  People need to be protected and their homes reinstated.  That is the mindset.<\/p><p> I urge the Minister to take time to meet the campaigning families.  As he knows, they have worked with the Housing Agency and they are trying to give him a workable scheme, but to deliver 100% redress in a manageable way.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  I put all that to the Minister.  I appreciate his attention.  I urge him to seriously consider taking an hour out of his schedule in the coming days.  I know it is a busy schedule, but all I ask for is an hour to engage with the families.  It would be helpful to the Minister and possibly to his senior officials too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#W00600","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak specifically to amendment No. 165.  When speaking to the amendment the Minister stated that it would be premature to accept it.  That is very hard for the people in Mayo who have been fighting for ten years to have their houses restored.  It is not premature for them.  As the Minister is aware, they have had ten years of anguish and watching their homes and lives crumble, physically and mentally, around them.  The question is who is responsible and who is accountable.  We all want to find that out.  We cannot have this monumental disaster and nobody is responsible for it.  This amendment gives an opportunity to address the issue in terms of producing a report.  All I ask is for a report to look at the introduction of levies against certain financial institutions, construction companies and insurance undertakings.  We must remember that mortgages are being paid to financial institutions on all of these properties that are worth zero, but the mortgages have not reduced in any way.  A profit is being made by the banks and financial institutions on the back of these crumbling homes, and the amendment seeks to address that.<\/p> <p>  There is also a responsibility on the construction companies and the sources of the materials that were supplied to the innocent people who have become the victims of this scandal.  They must also be accountable.  The insurance companies were quite willing to take in the premiums, as they are for all homes, and then they run for the hills when something goes wrong.  Something has gone drastically wrong here.  All these people are asking for is the restoration of their properties.  My colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, outlined the concerns we have about 100% redress and also the guarantees that must be provided, in addition to the other issues.  I commend the working group for the work it has done, but it did not report back when it was supposed to in September.  We are now six weeks or less from Christmas and these families are still left with uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  I urge the Minister to support the amendment to show that he is on the side of the homeowners and the citizens of this country by accepting it and showing that he is serious about looking for accountability.  I reiterate the calls for the Minister to meet some of the homeowners.  They are very realistic, down-to-earth, normal, ordinary people who are fighting for their homes and families and for redress.  We do not call it compensation because they can never be compensated for what has happened to them through no fault of their own.  We should ask for a contribution.  This has happened before.

It is possible to be on the side of the citizens of our country and not support this amendment.  The reason I do not support it is that the work the two Deputies are calling for is already under way.  That work is in respect of the awful issue that so many are confronting in Donegal and beyond with mica, where they have seen what they hoped to be their homes turn into crumbling buildings.  That work is in the final stages of completion and the Finance Bill is not the place to make reference to this.  The issues the Deputies referred to will be dealt with separately by the Government.  The issue of how we fund this is something I am concerned about and focused on.  I do so in the spirit of recognising the anguish the families are confronting, which has been raised by both Deputies.  I very much appreciate the need to bring this to a conclusion, but the Finance Bill is not the place to do it.  The Finance Bill deals with our tax law for next year and this issue has to be resolved well before then.  I am working on that with other members of the Government.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the non-procedural matters raised by the Deputies, the only thing I will say is that the inclusion of such an amendment in the Finance Bill is premature, given that we have work on mica that is in the final phases, I hope, of yielding a recommendation the Government will accept.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn raised issues regarding the role of the Housing Agency.  I understand the point he made.  I was involved in the pyrite scheme both from a policy point of view and through seeing the effect it had on constituents on the northside of Dublin, a number of whom were in my constituency.  I know that the average harm that is done to a home that has pyrite is of a different scale from that of many of the homes that had to deal with mica.  Excuse me, the other way around is what I mean.  I am sorry.  The average experience of the challenge that many families are now facing due to the effect of mica on their homes is very different from that of those who went through the experience with pyrite.  I take on board what Deputy Mac Lochlainn has said.  Deputy Doherty raised a role for the Housing Agency with me last Thursday on Leaders' Questions.<\/p> <p>  On the point both Deputies made regarding how we fund elements of all this, I am considering that at present.  It is not to diminish for a moment the stress that so many homeowners are going through to acknowledge that the cost of this is very considerable.  It is necessary, as part of looking at how we can fund a better response for those who have been afflicted by this awful experience, to look at ways in which this can be funded.  I listened to what the Deputies said in that regard and, again, it is something I and a number of my colleagues are considering at present.<\/p> <p>  As regards the engineering point raised by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, to be open with the Deputy, I know a little less about that than about some of the other issues he raised.  I hope we can find ways of giving confidence to families if a solution is available that does not involve the total demolition of their home, that we can give confidence in other solutions apart from demolition.  I have met families outside my Department who have been affected by this.  They conducted themselves with dignity and great calmness in the face of a terrible experience.  I imagine some of them, at least, would consider that there could be a benefit in not having to go through a process where a home is knocked down, it goes through a tendering process and is rebuilt, with all the time involved in that.  For some of them, I imagine that other works would be something they are willing to consider.  However, of the different issues that have been raised with me, that is one I need to understand a little more in the coming days.<\/p> <p>  As I said, the core reason for not accepting this amendment is that, particularly in the case of mica, I believe the Government will have moved forward on this issue well before we get to the implementation of tax law for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#Y00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>There are no other contributors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#Y00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I have a query.

The scheme was introduced as a temporary measure in 2016 with an estimated cost of &euro;130 million over two and a half years.  Revenue statistics showed that 23,149 claims for help to buy had been made by the end of 2020 with an estimated cost of &euro;370 million.  This is almost three times the amount originally anticipated.  Of the 23,149 claims successfully made under the help to buy scheme to the end of 2020, at least 41% of claimants already had a deposit of 10% and, therefore, did not need the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Figures on help to buy claims as a percentage of new dwelling completions show claims are highest in Leitrim and the midlands, amounting to more than 50% in Meath, and 47% in Kildare.  Claims for help to buy represent less than 20% of the new dwelling completions in Dublin, where we often hear of issues of affordability for first-time buyers and the most acute supply constraints.  The suggestion is that the help to buy scheme stimulated construction activity in areas where supply constraints are fewer rather than where demand is greatest.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, there were 6,202 successful claims under the help to buy scheme.  A total of 27% of all successful claims were for house prices above &euro;375,000, requiring an income of more than &euro;96,000 to qualify for a mortgage under the lending rules given to a 10% deposit.  A total of 61% were for houses priced above &euro;301,000.  There have been warnings that the scheme would lead to property price inflation.  We had that from the ESRI, the Central Bank and the Parliamentary Budget Office.  We know supply is ice cold and demand is red hot.  What we see is this scheme and the shared equity loan scheme pumping up demand while failing to increase supply.<\/p> <p>  Anyone could have told the Minister what the implications of this could be.  Since the scheme was enhanced in July 2020, property prices have increased by a further 11% Statewide.  I would like to hear the Minister's reasoning and rationale on this.  This is a poorly targeted scheme.  It is costly.  It is not good and sound economic policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#Z03200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I presume that was in order.

I am a Deputy for Limerick City.  I have been tracking how it is performing for a good number of years.  The merits of the scheme as announced on day one are very commendable.  Limerick is unique in that the entire core of the inner city is Georgian.  No other city has this.  Dublin might have a larger Georgian footprint but Limerick has concentration.  From Barrington Street at the top of the city, as far as City Hall and the Abbey River at the end of the city, and out to Nicholas Street and Mary Street on the other side is all Georgian.  Within this there are 5,000 or 6,000 units. They are not all Georgian but a huge number of them are.<\/p> <p>  The scheme has been there since 2015.  Figures are available for what is taken up in a year.  The scheme was originally an owner-occupier scheme.  It was then extended to a rental scheme for residents and it was then extended commercially.  Over the past six year, it has been taken up for 121 properties, which is approximately 20 per annum.  Limerick city has had a serious amount of job creation and a lot of good things are happening.  We have to deal with the core of the city being Georgian.  The scheme is due to conclude next December.  I am calling for a cross-departmental review.  I know it is an aspiration in the programme for Government to build on the living city initiative.  I would like to see consultants brought in to see what would work.  It may not just be about tax relief schemes.  There may be other measures.  In 2016 the take-up was ten and this was the same figure for 2017.  It was 16 in 2018, 19 in 2019, 33 in 2020 and 33 in 2021.<\/p><p>I do not have a breakdown between residential and commercial.  That take-up is very low.  What I want to see is how do I get the ordinary person coming in to live in the city centre to buy a Georgian building, investors coming in and purchasing it for rental, or businesses coming in.  It should not be the preserve of the very well off.  It has to be something that works for the ordinary person.<\/p><p> What I am asking is that the Minister give a commitment, which is something I will bring up again on Report Stage, to a cross-departmental review.  That is required, not only on tax but on other issues, whereby we deal with the footprint in Limerick city, which is Georgian, so that we have a scheme that is taken up by young single people or couples and elderly people looking to downsize in the city centre and feed into a model that brings about a greater number of people moving in to live in the city centre.  For us, no matter what we do, if we cannot deal with the Georgian footprint in our city, it is difficult for us to achieve that completely integrated model.<\/p><p> The Minister knows Limerick city reasonably well.  When walking the length of city it is Georgian.  It is something that we are very proud of and that can be a significant asset.  It is something that I would to see people from abroad who are looking to go on holiday view as the Georgian city of Limerick.  It is not quite like Pompeii, which people go to Italy to see.  We are unique.  We have this phenomenal asset but it requires a significant cost for anyone going in.<\/p><p> The approach required now is to determine, when it comes to December next year, what we can do.  In keeping with what is in the programme for Government, we should conduct a cross-departmental review, bring in consultants and, obviously, spearheaded by the Department of Finance under the Minister's direction to get a model that would be in place from 1 January 2023 or extend the living city initiative.  Such an extension may be the requirement.<\/p><p> It is something I feel strongly about.  The Minister's officials have been generous with their time.  It is something I want to go with in a technical way, but primarily in my role as a Deputy for Limerick city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#Z03400","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>The reason the help-to-buy scheme has a role to play in our tax code is I believe it is appropriate that our tax policy gives help to somebody who is buying his or her first home, particularly when that first home is a new build, thereby leading to additional supply.<\/p> <p>  There is a difference in philosophy between Sinn F&eacute;in and me on this.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that people are looking to buy their first home, they should not get any help in doing it; I do.  It has been a long-standing feature of our tax policy.  There have been many other ways of doing this over the past number of years.  The help-to-buy scheme is the latest version of it.  I accept the point that when the scheme was brought in in 2016, it was intended to be a temporary measure in terms of its design.  I will look fundamentally at its operation this year to decide whether there are better or new ways of meeting the aim of helping somebody with a contribution to the cost of buying his or her first home, only when that first home is a new build thereby driving supply.  There is a difference in philosophy and approach between the Government and Sinn F&eacute;in on this.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not believe help is needed or merited; I do.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the charges that are made against the scheme, I am aware, of course, of the studies that indicate that up to 40% of people had their deposit assembled before they went to buy their home but every tax measure brought forward will supply some help to those who do not have a great need for that help.  Every tax measure that I bring forward will do that.  Let us examine the range of Sinn F&eacute;in proposals in that regard.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to abolish the local property tax.  Many people would not need the money from the abolition of the tax but would still benefit from the move.  Sinn F&eacute;in is aware of this.  The party still advocates it.  Any tax policy will confer a benefit on those who need it less than others but even using the figures that Deputy Farrell outlined, a majority of people needed some help in assembling the deposit for their first-time home.<\/p> <p>  I believe that tax policy has a role to play in this, in particular, given that we are talking about a tax policy that only makes this help available if a new home is being built.  This would be a very different argument if this was a policy that was available for existing homes that are already built, but it is not.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the inflationary charge that is levied against this policy occasionally, of course, I fully understand the inflationary pressures under way in the housing market.  I fail to see how those pressures are made any more easy to deal with for those who are trying to buy their first home by the removal of the help-to-buy scheme, but dealing with that argument on its own terms, 12.7% of all house transactions last year were covered by the help-to-buy scheme.  That does not speak to an impact on transactions that, of itself, is causing house price inflation.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Farrell's point regarding this being drawn down in parts of the country less associated with house price inflation, I imagine the reason for that is this policy is also available for self-builds.  If Sinn F&eacute;in policy now is that if people are building their own homes they should not benefit from the help-to-buy scheme, I guess that is consistent with its abolition overall but there is an issue of equity between people who are living in cities or in our large and urban communities and those who are looking to build their own home in our rural communities.  I think that is the reason there is a variation in the drawdown of the help-to-buy scheme in the counties the Deputy mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Donnell raised the living city initiative, which is due to come to an end, as he stated, at the end of next year.  The Department will review this measure well in advance of then.  The Deputy has had engagement with my officials, which has been mutually beneficial.  It has been helpful for us as well.  Of course, he will raise this matter in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage.  If we want to look at how we can consider this issue expeditiously in a way that might influence the budget for next year, a cross-departmental review is not the way to do it because we would only end up with lots of different views.  There is many an enthusiasm that has gone into a cross-departmental review and spent many years in it.  I understand the Deputy has some technical suggestions he thinks could make a difference to the scheme.  I assure him that they will be fully evaluated before we get to next year's finance Bill.  My officials and I will engage with him on this matter in the early part of next year and give his ideas the consideration they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#AA00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the commitment from the Department of Finance.

This section is quite interesting and is there to support the industry.  I will be interested in the Minister's viewpoint on whether such a provision could provide opportunities for tax arbitrage.  Has the Department conducted any risk analysis in this regard?  My interest comes from the fact that this section will also apply to the aircraft leasing sector which, as we know, is in the business of not just leasing aircraft but, often, entire flight crews.  I understand income tax relief only applies to jurisdictions with which we have a double tax treaty, but we have treaties with other popular low-tax leasing locations, such as Hong Kong and Singapore.  Will it also apply to the Chinese tax-free special economic zones, which are also quite popular as a location for aviation leasing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#CC01700","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I was reflecting on the point she made regarding the Chinese economic zone.  We will have to come back to her with an answer on that.<\/p> <p>  On the rationale for this section and whether it applies to leased aircraft, and the Deputy's important points on whether we conducted an risk analysis and what kind of benefit we thought it would have, I do not believe this measure adds to the opportunities for tax arbitrage in any way.  The main saving and benefit for airlines will be a significant administrative change that I hope will lead to a cost saving for airlines registered in Ireland.  I hope that will, in turn, be a factor in airlines registering more of their staff here.  If there are tax arbitrage opportunities, which there are in terms of where airlines, aeroplanes and staff are registered, I do not believe this section will add to them in any way.  This is about a significant simplification of how this process works.  <\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point regarding the leasing industry, this is an air crew measure only.  To deal with the Deputy's point on whether it could apply to crew on aeroplanes that are leased, the answer to that question is \"Yes, it could\", but the benefit only applies to the crew rather than the capital equipment which, in this case, is the aeroplane.  <\/p> <p>  More broadly, this is a measure that I have considered in other finance Bills and at other points, but I always believed it was not appropriate to introduce it at other points because of the large number of staff we already had registered in Ireland.  The Deputy's concerns about dead weight and other measures would have a higher validity in the case of this measure if we brought it in at a point at which we already had a very large number of staff registered in Ireland.  We have seen big impacts on the aviation sector in Ireland and we have seen the number of staff registered here decline, which are issues she is already well familiar with.  If we bring this measure in now, it has a chance of having a far lower dead weight impact than it would have had at other points.<\/p> <p>  On whether this measure will apply to China, it will only apply to countries with which we have a double taxation agreement, DTA.  Since we have such an agreement with China, it would, in theory, be able to benefit from this agreement.  However, to avail of it, the crew in question has to be subject to tax in the country with which we have the DTA and they have to be resident here or in the relevant DTA country.  I am afraid I do not know a huge amount about the operation of Chinese economic zones, particularly with regard to aviation.  If those are environments in which crews pay no tax, they will have difficulties benefiting from this agreement.  That is the short answer to the Deputy's question.  Overall, China will be able to benefit from this change because we have a double taxation agreement with it, but from the discussion I have had with my officials on this, the vast majority of the drawdown for this scheme, if not all of it, will be in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#CC01800","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":712,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":713,"content":"<p>There are no amendments to section 9.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#CC02000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I would like to ask some quick questions on section 9.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#CC02100","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":715,"content":"<p>The Deputy can raise anything.

I will ask my officials to advise me on the tax treatment of that.  In the meantime, I will try to answer the remainder of her questions.  In regard to the rationale for this, this recommendation was brought forward by the interdepartmental pensions reform and taxation group, which is administered by my Department and the Department of Social Protection.  Broadly, the reason we are doing it here is in recognition that the ARF option is a retirement option, which has a number of advantages to it compared to how annuities are conducted.  In the environment that we are in at the moment, it is becoming more accepted that ARFs represent better value for money than annuities, particularly when we are in an interest rate environment that is low.  The ARF option also allows the holder to access funds in a more flexible manner.<\/p> <p>  In terms of those who will benefit from this and how they will benefit, they will have the opportunity to either purchase an ARF or to purchase an annuity.  They will have more flexibility than they have at the moment.  I remind the committee that this applies only to death-in-service benefits.  This would happen where somebody working in our public service passes away and his or her partner, spouse or child has to make a decision about the future of that person's pension contributions.  We are looking to give them more options at that point.  On the question as to what would happen then, if it happens upon the sad occurrence of death, which it would in these circumstances, the lump sum will pass tax free to the spouse, but at the point it is drawn down from the ARF, it becomes subject to tax.

It was raised in the context of those people who reside in the State but who work in the North and who avail of the trans-border workers&rsquo; relief.  Obviously, this tax relief is not normally available for Irish residents who work from home in the State but, in the unprecedented circumstances arising due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health restrictions to limit movement, for the tax years 2020 and 2021 Revenue confirmed that a concessional treatment for this relief would apply whereby, if employees are required to work from home in the State due to Covid-19, such days working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met.  It should be noted that cross-border workers face the prospect of working from home in the context of continued public health advice possibly into 2022, with no real clarity on the future of the scheme and its operation.<\/p><p> The relief effectively removes the earnings from a qualifying foreign employment from liability to Irish tax where foreign tax has been paid on those earnings and such tax is not refundable.  The effect of the measures means that individuals who qualify for the relief will not pay any Irish tax on their employment income, and that tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from the qualifying foreign employment.  There are a number of criteria that have to be satisfied in this regard.<\/p><p> The Minister undertook that the operation of the trans-border workers&rsquo; relief would be examined as part of the Tax Strategy Group in 2021, which would consider all relevant matters, including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax.  Given the fact people are likely to continue to work from home in the coming months, it would be good to have this section included.  I note the tax strategy paper reached a number of conclusions, and I am not going to go through them.  Nonetheless, there are issues in the paper that are warranted and required and I would be interested to hear the Minister's views in this regard.<\/p><p> Section 6 of the paper considered the issue of social insurance and noted that social insurance rates in the North are higher than those in the South.  However, the example at section 3.2, which considered equity, failed to take account of employees&rsquo; social contributions when comparing the effective tax rates paid in both jurisdictions.  I would like a comment from the Minister on that because it could be a flaw that perhaps undermines the comparison.<\/p><p> The proposal of the Cross-Border Workers Coalition was to limit the number of days cross-border workers could work from the State to 183 while still being able to claim the relief.  It proposed that other controls could be introduced, such as limiting the scope to those in non-executive roles and the potential consideration of a salary threshold.  Given this is the case, and given the importance of developing the all-island economy and the move to remote working, further examination of this relief is warranted, and its extension is also warranted given the prospect of continued public health guidance.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to go back to the drawing board and re-examine the issue, which is affecting cross-border workers, families and businesses, and to consider extending the relief in the context of Covid-19.  I ask him to undertake work with my colleague, the Minister, Conor Murphy, in the context of the North-South Ministerial Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#EE00600","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy is requesting a comprehensive report on trans-border workers&rsquo; relief.  This relief is provided for by section 825A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, TCA, and generally applies in the case of cross-border workers who are Irish resident but who commute to work in another jurisdiction.  The relief effectively removes the foreign employment income from a liability to Irish tax where foreign tax has been paid on that income, and such foreign tax is, therefore, not refundable.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy may recall, we discussed this relief at last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  I indicated at that point that the relief would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group, TSG, for 2021.  I did this and this relief was examined by the TSG this year.  At its meeting on 8 September last, the TSG discussed the review of trans-border workers&rsquo; relief and, subsequently, the TSG paper was published and it is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p> <p>  The review specifically focused on trans-border workers&rsquo; relief and the requests to place on a statutory footing a concessional treatment granted by Revenue in light of the unprecedented circumstances arising due to the pandemic.  This request seeks to allow individuals who are resident in the State, but who work outside the State for a non-resident employer, to continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State.  This would mean that Irish residents working in the State for a non-resident employer could work in the State and only pay tax in the other jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>  Ordinarily, to avail of the relief, the duties of employment must be performed wholly outside the State and in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement, DTA.  However, a flexible and pragmatic approach was taken by Revenue due to the imposition of public health restrictions to limit movement and to prevent the spread of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The examination undertaken by the TSG encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters, including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax.  The review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective when having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers.  The review noted that if the temporary concession regarding trans-border workers&rsquo; relief was placed on a statutory footing, it would allow residents in the State to avail of the relief while working in the State and pay no tax to the Exchequer.  Where employment duties are carried out in the State, Ireland has a taxing right over that income and to not tax that income would be asking the State to give up a taxing right it rightfully has under the Irish tax code.  It is unclear to me why Ireland would not exercise those taxing rights and it also unclear how another jurisdiction would then have taxing rights over income earned in the State in respect of duties carried out in the State.<\/p> <p>  The review identified issues relating to equity for all taxpayers.  Currently, there may be different tax liabilities and different effective tax rates between those Irish residents who can avail of the relief as compared to those who cannot avail of the relief.  However, there is a key distinguishing factor in that the employment duties are exercised outside the State for a non-resident employer.  If trans-border workers&rsquo; relief was to be relaxed to allow for work carried out in the State to qualify for the relief, there would no longer be a distinguishing factor between Irish residents as both sets of Irish residents would be exercising their employment duties in the State.  In such circumstances, some, that is, those with Irish-resident employers, would be liable to tax at the Irish tax rates and a potentially higher effective tax rate, while others, that is, those with non-resident employers, would be liable to tax at the tax rates in the other jurisdiction and a potentially lower effective tax rate.<\/p> <p>  This would give rise to a question as to how Irish income tax rules could apply a different Irish income tax treatment to an Irish resident solely because of the location of their employer, as opposed to the location of where they carry out their employment duties, as is the current position.  This would give rise to issues of equity and fairness for all resident employees in the State with regard to issues that are fundamental features of our income tax system.<\/p><p>It is not clear how this would be sustainable and acceptable from the perspective of all Irish-resident taxpayers.<\/p><p> This review also found the competitive position of Irish-based employers or activities could potentially be undermined.  This is especially the case where salaries would be subject to lower rates of tax, and that may have implications for Irish-based employers' cost base and their ability to attract and attain employees from their talent pool.<\/p><p> It is also important to note Ireland is somewhat unique in having such relief in its domestic tax code.  There is no comparable measure in the UK's tax code nor in many countries in mainland Europe that share land borders.  Ireland has an extensive network of double taxation agreements which have the effect of eliminating double taxation on the same income source.  In the event an individual does not qualify for trans-border worker's relief, he or she may be entitled to relief from double taxation, under the terms of the relevant double taxation agreement, DTA.  Thus a double taxation charge would not arise for cross-border workers.<\/p><p> This matter has been reviewed in recent months.  It was considered comprehensively in the tax strategy group, TSG, paper.  This is a brief overview of the matters raised, but the report is available on the Department's website.  In the absence of any new or compelling changes in circumstances, a further review at this time is not needed.  Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#FF00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":744,"content":"<p>The Minister has replied.

Emerging from the pandemic, it is clearer than ever before we need a more agile and responsive State and a stronger social safety net, a health service that works, and a public childcare option for parents that is genuinely affordable.  This can only be done through an increase in tax revenue in the form of additional taxation or less in the way of tax expenditure.  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare will examine these options, as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has done, but the programme for Government all but rules out additional revenue measures other than behavioural tax measures, the purpose of which, on the face of it, is not for revenue generation.<\/p><p>These amendments call for the examination of measures to increase revenue through changes to the income tax system, namely, the tapering of tax credits on individual incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 and the introduction of a solidarity levy on individual incomes of approximately &euro;140,000.  We had quite a conversation on the need for a solidarity levy earlier on and I will not rehash that.  However, it should be noted that in 2022, the effective tax rate on a full-rate PRSI individual income of &euro;100,000 will be 38.1%, compared with 38.5% in 2021 and 41.1% in 2013, and the effective tax rate on a full-rate PRSI individual income of &euro;120,000 will be 40.4%, compared with 40.7% in 2021 and 42.9% in 2014.  Also in 2022, the effective tax rate on a full-rate PRSI individual income of &euro;150,000 will be 42.7%, compared with 43% in 2021.<\/p><p>Tapering tax credits at a rate of 2.5% on individual incomes above &euro;100,000 and introducing a 3% solidarity tax on a portion of individual incomes above &euro;140,000 would not change the effective tax rate on a full-rate PRSI individual income of &euro;100,000.  It would increase the effective tax rate on a full-rate PRSI individual income of &euro;120,000 to 41.8% and would increase the effective tax rate on a full-rate PRSI individual income of &euro;150,000 to 45.1%.  Withdrawing PAYE earned income tax credits at the previously proposed rate of 5% from those with taxable income above &euro;100,000 would create an effective rate of 64.2% between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000.<\/p><p>The British tax system incorporates a personal tax allowance, which is subject to a tapered withdrawal for individual incomes in excess of &pound;100,000 per annum.  In this context, it is worth noting a tax allowance allows relief at a taxpayer's marginal rate, whereas the PAYE earned income tax credit is a standard rate tax credit, and the British allowance is reduced by &pound;1 for every &pound;2 earned above this limit, tapering out once income reaches &pound;123,000.<\/p><p>That &pound;100,000 threshold was chosen as all individuals with income above that level were already obliged to file a tax return each year and this facilitated the operation of the taper.  By contrast, there is not a similar liability to file a tax return based on income level in this State at present and that would likely need to be reviewed if the policy of tapering the credits was to be pursued.  We have had long conversations earlier about solidarity taxes and taxes in that regard, so in the interest of timing and for all committee members and the Vice Chairman, I will not rehash that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#GG01700","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":759,"content":"<p>The reason I do not support the policy brought forward by Deputy Farrell is contained in some of the figures she read out, where she referred to the high marginal tax rates that would be faced at the levels of income that would be affected by this change.  Were the personal tax credit of &euro;1,650 to be tapered out at a rate of 5% per &euro;1,000, or a loss of just over 8% of additional euro of income, the marginal tax rate within that taper zone would be just over 60%.  Once you moved beyond that taper period, at income of more than &euro;120,000, the marginal rate would revert back to 52%.<\/p> <p>  We have a long-running debate in the Oireachtas on the need to attract hospital consultants back to Ireland.

However, some people on those levels of income are important to the functioning of our health service and-or very important to large employers we have here in Ireland.

Every one of us in this committee room knows of the major issue with people struggling to pay their rents.  The latest <i>daft.ie<\/i>rental report shows that rents are continuing to rise across the State.  Renters in Munster, Connacht and Ulster face hikes of between 15% and 18% annually.  I see it in my constituency in Galway city, but I also see it in rural and remote areas, including on our islands, where rent is ever increasing.  The average monthly asking rent for the third quarter of 2021 was more than &euro;1,500.  <\/p><p>The Government introduced legislation pegging rents to inflation.  The Minister spoke at length on the issue of inflation, but unfortunately the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, does not seem to be aware of it.  It allows landlords to increase rent by 5.1%.  This would increase the average Dublin city centre rent, which stands at &euro;2,032, by &euro;104 euro per month or &euro;1,244 per year and the average rent across the State, which stands at &euro;1,516, by &euro;77 per month or &euro;928 per year.  We know people do not have this kind of extra income lying around.  It is madness to introduce legislation that would allow landlords to increase already unaffordable rents by another 2%.  People cannot afford these rents.<\/p><p>These rent rises provide the first data set reflective of the changes made to the rent pressure zone legislation which linked rent to inflation.  The report states that 17 counties had double-digit rent inflation and rents are continuing to soar outside the Dublin area, with rents increasing by over 20% in counties Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  This is an enormous expense for households to carry.  The rental crisis continues unabated.  Tweaks to failing rent pressure zone legislation have simply failed.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in wants the introduction of a time-bound refundable tax credit for renters in the private sector, at a rate of 8.3% of annual rent and equivalent to one month's rent, in conjunction with a three-year ban on rent increases.  This would provide much-needed relief for renters, effectively reducing the burden they face.<\/p><p>In 2009, the Commission on Taxation recommended discontinuing the income tax relief for rent paid, but on the grounds that the relief would increase demand and, therefore, rents to the benefit of landlords.  However, this problem would not arise as we are proposing that a refundable tax credit for rent paid would be accompanied by a ban on rent increases for the period in which the relief was payable.<\/p><p>The Minister and all of us who are public representatives know this.  People coming to our clinics tell us they just cannot pay the rent.  Some of them need to move back into their parents' home.  The woman who works in my constituency office rang me today to say there was a couple with their three children living in one room in one of their parents' houses because they could no longer afford the rent after they lost their jobs during the pandemic.  That is the real face of this.<\/p><p>I genuinely think this would work.  We need to do something that will work.  What has been done up till now is simply not working.  We need to help people who cannot afford to pay their rents and this is a practical solution.  I would be delighted if the Minister would support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#HH00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I should mention that we have only three minutes left.

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief be discontinued.  The view of the commission then was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.<\/p> <p>  In addition, a tax credit of this nature would be of little benefit to lower income workers, the unemployed and students, who would not receive the benefit of the relief as they may not be paying sufficient levels of income tax.<\/p> <p>  At the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97 million per annum.

It would be inserted on page 20, between lines 25 and 26, and proposes the introduction of a report on pension tax reliefs and subsidies to be laid before the D&aacute;il within six months.  Given that pension reliefs amount to approximately &euro;2.7 billion per annum in revenue forgone, greater than the entire 2022 expenditure allocation for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, we need to examine the value for money and equity of these reliefs.<\/p><p>Ireland, in common with most other advanced economies, taxes pensions under a regime that can be broadly characterised as exempt, exempt, taxed, EET, whereby income is exempt from tax when first received and paid into a pension, exempt from tax as the returns accrue, and taxed when funds are withdrawn from the pension.  However, there are some important exceptions to this broadly EET regime in Ireland.  Since 2011, employee pension contributions are subject to both employee PRSI and USC.  Pension income drawdown in retirement is subject to USC but not employee or employer PRSI and individuals can draw down a large tax-free lump sum in retirement.  Contributions are subject to annual limits that vary with age.  These exceptions mean that neither employee nor employer PRSI is ever levied on the overwhelming majority of employer pension contributions and this is because PRSI is not charged on the incomes of those above the State pension age and only since 2014 on certain forms of unearned income.  In other words, employer pension contributions are subject to an exempt, exempt, exempt PRSI regime.  Speaking at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on 24 June this year, Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins of UCD noted:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe largest area of personal tax expenditure relates to pensions. Overall, pension reliefs amount to &euro;2.7 billion per annum in revenue forgone. Reform to this area sits in the context of other proposed reforms to pension savings supports, including the introduction of auto-enrolment, which may carry significant additional costs in State subsidies and tax expenditure. Within the area of pension savings, three tax expenditure measures are worth reforming. The first of those is limiting all pension contributions to tax relief at a single rate of income taxation. Currently, this is offered at the marginal rate. This means that the State supports the savings of higher income earners more than those on lower incomes. Depending on whether the adjustment was to a standard rate for all or to a hybrid rate, say 31%, the annual savings would be between &euro;200 million and &euro;400 million per annum. <\/blockquote> <p>On average, 775,000 people make pension contributions every month through employer payrolls and this represents approximately 30% of all employees on average.  Slightly more than 875,000 employees made pension contributions at some point in 2019.  This is based on cumulative pension contributions and cumulative income for the year.  Those on greater incomes are paying, on average, a greater amount of pension contributions and that means they are primarily benefiting from tax relief on pension contributions at a cost to the Exchequer, with tax relief on employees' contributions to approved superannuation schemes in 2018 costing &euro;678 million.  For example, in 2019 4,200 individuals with incomes above &euro;300,000 availed of pension contributions totalling &euro;87.6 million, costing the taxpayer approximately &euro;35 million.  How is this equitable?  I would like to hear the views of the Minister in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#QQ00100","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":783,"content":"<p>In terms of the tax treatment of supplementary pensions, Ireland operates an exempt, exempt, tax system, similar to the majority of other OECD countries. This means that pensions are exempt from income tax and pension fund gains are exempt from income tax but income from pension drawdown is taxed.  In my view, we should seek to make overall progress in the area of pensions provision in a manner that is well considered and comprehensive.  That broad approach is what has informed recent action in this area, including the roadmap for pensions reform 2018-2023 which, in turn, led to the work of the interdepartmental pensions reform and taxation group and the separate work of the Pensions Commission.<\/p> <p>  As the committee may be aware, the interdepartmental group was tasked with a number of actions relating to the pensions roadmap, including proposals aimed at simplifying and harmonising the supplementary pension landscape and an assessment of the cost of State support for pension savings.  The resultant report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in November 2020. <\/p> <p>  As regards the Exchequer cost of State support for supplementary pensions, the report noted that, in common with most developed countries, fiscal support for private pension saving exists in Ireland.  This support is provided by way of tax relief, with its inclusion in the Irish tax code predating the foundation of the State.  It observed that, in providing incentives, states are motivated by the policy objective of increasing aggregate savings or encouraging citizens to provide for their retirement by deferring a sufficient amount of income and consumption today to provide for their later years.  This is based on an assumption that individuals require an incentive to lock up savings until they retire, given that alternative saving vehicles allow ongoing access.<\/p> <p>  The report noted that the tax treatment of pensions represents one of the largest tax expenditures.  It is challenging to capture the exact data needed to comprehensively analysis the varying forms of pension relief.  However, that said, where such data are available on the Exchequer cost of tax relief for pensions, these data are publicly available and included in Revenue&rsquo;s publication on the cost of tax expenditures.  The latest data available is in respect of 2018.<\/p> <p>  With regard to a distributional analysis, I am advised by Revenue that prior to the introduction of real-time reporting on 1 January 2019, pension contributions were reported to Revenue at an employer level rather than an employee level.  I am further advised that data from tax returns of PAYE and self-assessed individuals for 2019 are still being processed and consolidated by Revenue.  Once this work is completed, analysis can be carried out, reconciling taxpayers to a taxpayer unit basis and accounting for all income sources and pension contributions made.  This analysis, which is necessary to estimate a cost associated with employee pension contributions at a taxpayer unit level, is anticipated to be completed in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the policy objective for tax relief for pensions is to encourage individuals to save for retirement, to meet a target level of supplementary pension coverage and an income replacement target, and to assist in preventing an over-reliance on State support for people in later life.<\/p><p> This is particularly important due to the future demographic pressures facing the State.  On this, the science is clear.  The fall in the birth rate in recent decades means there will be fewer and fewer people joining the workforce while increases in longevity mean that more and more will be relying on pension payments.  This shift in the demographic structure of the population will put increasing pressure on the State pension system and pose a challenge to the sustainability of our public finances.<\/p><p> The Pensions Commission produced a report, the Report of the Commission on Pensions, in October.  It lays out the challenges that we face and why the need for sustainability is so important.<\/p><p> Having regard to everything I have just detailed and the published data currently available in respect of the cost of pensions tax relief, with a further publication imminent, I do not believe that a further report is necessary for now.

The Government has, under pressure, had to move towards a higher nominal rate of corporate tax.<\/p><p>It fought hard to minimise the extent of any increase as part of the OECD and G20 process for raising corporate tax, particularly railing against the idea that there might be any latitude to go beyond 15%.  I do not agree with the Government's position on that because I think it is immoral that corporations pay a lower rate of tax than workers who work on the floor within those very corporations or workers generally.  The working population pays at least 20% tax in total, if not quite a considerable amount more, on their income.  The average is probably somewhere between 20% and 30%.  Corporations are paying a hell of a lot less.  It is not just the nominal rate.  While I welcome the increase to 15%, I think it should go higher.  The headline rate should be at least what a worker is paying on average.  That is only fair.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding that debate, I am also concerned it is all immaterial if there is such a range of reliefs, deductions and allowances from which corporations can benefit and exploit that the actual amount of tax corporations pay is considerably less than that.  We discussed some of this earlier but it is worth responding to some of the Minister's earlier comments about the difference between the figures for gross profits of corporations and taxable profits.  Taxable profits allow the Government to say there is an effective rate of approximately 10.3%.  I think that was the figure the Minister mentioned.  The Government can say that because corporations can go from &euro;203 billion in pre-tax gross trading profits to approximately &euro;100 billion.  I am looking for the figures now, although I quoted them earlier.  That happens through the use of a series of allowances, deductions and reliefs.  In our budget submission, we highlighted some of the main headings under which this is done and they are detailed in a document Revenue produces every year, Costs of Tax Expenditures (Credits, Allowances and Reliefs).  Some of the main headings under which corporations can write down their taxable profits are \"capital allowances\", \"intragroup transactions\", \"company reconstructions and amalgamations\", \"losses, including capital allowances, brought forward\", \"group relief\", \"research and development\", \"tax credit\" and \"knowledge development box\", to name some of the big ones.  The ones I find most interesting are the intragroup transactions and the capital allowances.  Those are the biggest.  They are staggering.  They are described accurately in Revenue documents and tables as \"costs to the Exchequer\".  Intragroup transactions, as a cost to the Exchequer, amounted to &euro;16 billion.  It is an absolutely stunning figure.<\/p><p> We do not have a capital allowances figure for 2019, although the Minister may have that figure and I would be interested to know if he does.  For 2018, the cost to the Exchequer of capital allowances was &euro;9 billion.  That is quite extraordinary.  Taken together, those two costs to the Exchequer alone amount to &euro;25 billion.  It also means that multiples of that profit was not taxed.  How it that happening?  If it is an intragroup transaction, that gives us a fair clue.  That is how one subsidiary of a big multinational gets a Revenue figure, its pre-tax gross trading profits, which might be &euro;1 billion, and says it does not have &euro;1 billion of profit because it owes &euro;900 million to a subsidiary of the corporation for the use of intellectual property.  It does not then have &euro;1 billion of profits to tax, it has only &euro;100 million.  What is actually a profit generated from sales by that company then becomes a cost which they can claim against their taxable profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#RR01600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I want to bring in the others who have indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#SS00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":802,"content":"<p>That is no problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#SS00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#SS00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":804,"content":"<p>To me, that is tax avoidance and it is big multinational corporations essentially writing their own tax bill.

His amendment is similar to ours.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the two-pillar solution on international tax reform reached at the OECD and its principles and objectives.  Like every element of our tax code, we must make sure that this agreement, once implemented, is actually complied with by companies within that scope.  Our amendment calls for a report on the two-pillar solution agreed by the OECD-G20 inclusive framework to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy, its impact on Exchequer revenue, its consequences for economic competitiveness and options for a renewed industrial strategy in the context of this changing landscape.  This is crucial for a number of reasons.  It is crucial to provide clarity on its operation and the number of enterprises in scope under pillars 1 and 2.

The insurance industry reported that it had &euro;163 million in operating profits last year, the highest figure in more than a decade.  The report stated that you would have to go back to 2009 at least to see a higher figure.  It could be even further than that.  Last year, there was a 26% decline in road accident injury claims.  This is not surprising when considering what was going on with the pandemic.  There were lockdowns.  People were not able to travel more than a couple of kilometres from their house, etc.  Yet, what did we see?  We saw a 7% reduction in premiums on average.  We saw rebates averaging at 3%.  The insurance industry absolutely creamed it.  It used, exploited and abused the pandemic in order to maximise profits at the expense of ordinary people who are try to push back against the pandemic.  The insurance industry is not a solo runner in this regard.  The insurance industry is not an example of an outlier.  Plenty of big corporations did very well from the pandemic over the last 18 months.  These include private hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry and big tech where profits are at a record high.  There is a k-shaped economy recovery.  Some workers will not get their jobs back and some workers' incomes have been slashed during the 18 months of pandemic.<\/p> <p>  I refer to other groups, including so-called high-net-worth individuals and big sections of corporate industry in this country.  Why did we have a debate about raising corporate tax in terms of a ceiling of 15%?  Why do we not at least have a debate where we say that corporations in this country could, and should, pay the rate of tax that is paid by the majority of working people?  The idea that 25% of profits would be paid in tax is not an incredible or unreasonable idea.  It is a very reasonable idea.  I do not think we would see a flight of capital in that circumstance.  Corporations have good reasons for being here.  They have access to the EU markets, an English-speaking labour force, a highly skilled and highly educated labour force, etc.  The proposal is a modest one.  It asks for a report to be drawn up on this idea or proposition.

Mind you, it is not the first time I have heard it.  It has been a commonly debated issue in the House for as long as I have been around, and that is not a short time.<\/p> <p>  I will first address the whole question of multinational corporations.  I come from constituency in which many multinational corporations have invested and in which they provide tens of thousands of jobs.  I want to set that as part of the background to the debate here.  It is suggested, for instance, in the context of the OECD's proposal, which has been adopted, to impose a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% rate on the basis that this was going to help.  Of course, the OECD's proposal was not going to spook anybody, because everybody was in the same boat at the same time.  That was the main reason.<\/p> <p>  We should remember that international corporations only get spooked when it becomes obvious that they are about to be descended upon.  Venezuela is a classic example of where this happened.  The same debate took place there.  There is no reason international corporations would be in any way in favour of having tax deducted at an alarmingly higher rate than had been done before.  They have to plan ahead as well.  They plan carefully and cautiously.  In the case of Venezuela, once it became known what was going to happen, the whole thing collapsed overnight.  That is a fact.  The consequences of that will be felt in Venezuela for many a day.  Unfortunately, the poorer people, the workers about whom we talk so regularly in this House, are the people who suffered most because the international corporations could disappear into the more lucrative areas.  That is one thing that we need to bear in mind.<\/p> <p>  There is another thing we need to keep in mind, and Deputy Boyd Barrett has often explained this carefully and cogently.  It relates to how the multinational corporations should be paying more when compared with the rate that individuals in the workforce pay.  That is fine.  However, no comparison is being made with the number of individuals in the workforce whose employment prospects rest with those corporations.  If the corporations moves out of a country, not only will its workforce be hit again and again, but the revenue will disappear as well.  The workforce&rsquo;s tax will be gone and the investor or corporation tax will be gone.  The corporations will go somewhere else.  In terms of the workforce, they will compete by going to a country that changes its laws.  I am not saying that changes in laws are not required from time to time.  The Minister has at various times in budgets and in finance Bills closed various loopholes where there was a necessity to do so and where there was obvious abuse of the system.  That has been the practice down through the years.<\/p> <p>  When we present the arguments, it may well be that only the Minister will be on the other side of the argument.  It may be that the Minister will be depicted as a cold, harsh, right-wing, Thatcherite, Tory Minister and that nothing else applies.  However, that is not the case.  There is another argument and it needs to be aired by everyone in the Parliament at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#TT00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":813,"content":"<p>The Minister to respond please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#TT00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":814,"content":"<p>Iwill deal with the different points put to me.  I will begin with Deputy Farrell&rsquo;s amendment.  The reason I am not in a position to accept the amendment from the Deputy is that I anticipate that the further information we will need to be able model the impact of the OECD changes on our corporate tax revenue will not be available to us until the second quarter of next year at the earliest.  The Department will at that point begin the work to revalue the impact of these changes on our corporate tax revenue.  As soon as that information is available to me, I will share it with the Government and the Oireachtas.  That is work I have always committed to doing.  It is a very reasonable request from the Opposition.  Government needs to understand the impact of these changes on tax revenue.  As soon as we have enough detail to form a view as to what that impact is, we will share that with the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I will debunk one claim that has developed a little bit of momentum.  The claim is that because the rate of corporation tax is going up, so will the amount of money that Government will be collecting.  The issue is that this is a two-pillar tax agreement.  It is fair to say that if all other things were unchanged, <i>ceteris paribus,<\/i>a higher rate would yield higher revenue.  However, the issue for us is the other pillar of the global tax deal, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights.<\/p><p>We will lose revenue in that pillar.  There is a share of economic activity that is currently taxed in Ireland that will move to markets in which either the good is purchased or the service is consumed.  When the technical work on that is complete, and we are reasonably confident it will stabilise in a certain way, we will then inform the Oireachtas regarding the impact of that and the money we hope to collect in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>On the point Deputy Boyd Barrett put to me, when he was speaking I asked my officials to get the information to inform our debate on what the average level of effective tax rates in Ireland at different income levels is.  Let us assume for now that in the coming years, we will see the implementation of the legislation that leads to the collection of a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for companies with a global turnover of more than &euro;750 million.  I believe that will happen.  As we will see the implementation of that deal globally, we will also see that happen in Ireland.  It is worth saying that at &euro;25,000, the average effective tax rate in Ireland is 12% to 12.5%.  In response to the Deputy's argument that the tax on capital is low, that argument will gain greater currency for incomes of more than &euro;30,000.  The Deputy might say that incomes of more than &euro;30,000 should have an effective tax rate higher than 15%.  However, it is essential to make the point that for those who are on the lowest incomes in Ireland, their effective tax rates will be lower than a globally collected minimum effective tax rate for the largest companies.  The Deputy may underestimate the effect this deal will have on the ability for that tax to be collected.  He has claimed - I always respect the way in which he does so - that those who earn the least will pay lower effective tax rates than global capital after this agreement is implemented.  I believe that will no longer be the case.  In Ireland, the effective tax rates those on low income pay is lower than the minimum effective tax rate in Ireland that corporates pay on average.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the Deputy's point about intra-group transfers, which I fully accept is an incredibly complex world where vast amounts of money move around within companies.  The movement of money within these companies nearly always refers to things that have value.  I refer, for example, to rent that is paid on intellectual property and payments that move between companies because intellectual property moves within a company.  That intellectual property has value in the first place, and it often has huge value.  At least some of the intra-group transfers referred to by the Deputy are due to payments moving within groups because something in turn is moving that has gigantic value.  The intellectual property of this century is equivalent to the factories, railways and fixed hard physical capital that was visible decades ago.  To suggest that these intra-group payments happen in isolation of economic activity is wrong.<br\/><br\/>It is also worth noting that the way in which that is, therefore, taxed is through transfer pricing.  Due to the work of the OECD, transfer pricing and the rules in relation to it are increasingly harmonised.  The transfer pricing rules are increasingly consistent across all jurisdictions.  If the Deputy wants us to change that in Ireland and engage in transfer pricing rules that are different from those in other OECD or EU countries, we will be back to square one in our argument.  If Ireland were to go on its own in such matters, it would be a source of the very uncertainty or instability that will cause the loss of jobs in our country.  The Deputy might argue that that never or rarely happens but he should have a look at the front page of today's <i>Financial Times<\/i>.  Two companies that were once tax resident in Holland have now moved.  I do not know what the effect that will have on the Dutch taxpayer or Dutch employment.  That is a matter for the Dutch Government.  The registration of two companies that were important to the Dutch economy has now changed.  The Deputy may be willing to take the risk in relation to really large employers in Ireland and say we could go it alone on issues like transfer pricing but I am not and that is the difference in our views on the matter.<br\/><br\/>I refer to what Deputy Barry said and the amendment he has put forward.  I will offer a counter-view to the different points he made.  Big pharma played the role in producing the vaccine.  Big tech played the role in the technology that helped most of us move out of the office and work from home.  I am not aware of the profit levels private hospitals made in the last year in Ireland, but the private hospital capacity here played a role in having a surge ICU capacity available to us if required.<br\/><br\/>I am somewhat puzzled by the Deputy's argument.  Whenever Deputy Barry and I exchange views in the D&aacute;il or in debates like this, he rarely has a good word to say about the country.  He rarely has a good word to say about our public services, housing market, the availability of childcare and good public infrastructure.  I genuinely do not think I have never heard him give a positive view about those things.  However, he will come into this committee and say that the Ireland about which he does not have a good word to say is the Ireland that is still good enough to keep all these jobs if we jack up the tax rate.  Which one is it because it cannot be both?<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's amendment proposes a 25% tax rate for corporations with more than &euro;800,000 in profit.  An awful lot of small Irish companies that pay corporate tax would be shocked to find out that Deputy Barry wants to double the tax rate they pay.  Many companies in Ireland which are not big tech, big pharma or the large employers always referred to by the Deputy in pejorative terms would be covered by his proposal.  Small- or medium-sized companies that pay corporate tax would get quite the land if they woke up and found out that the Government had doubled their tax rate.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Barry asserted that incomes have been savaged and jobs have been lost, which will not come back because of the pandemic.  Incomes have been protected in this country due to the pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme.  That does not fit into the Deputy's world view in regard to what has happened in the country, but incomes have been protected.  As to the jobs he has referred to that will not come back, of course I regret that for some who were working in certain sectors, the jobs they had are not the jobs they will go back to.  There are now 60,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment.  I remember, as I am sure the Deputy does, when more than 600,000 people were on it.  I remember earlier this year when nearly 500,000 people were on it at one point.<\/p><p>Regrettably, some may not be going back to the job that they had before the pandemic hit.  From the point of view of jobs and income, the country fared far better than the Deputy would have hoped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#TT00600","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":817,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Barry wish to press amendment No. 23?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#VV00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I would like a chance to reply to some of the points that the Minister made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#VV00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to be brief.

The Minister should listen and engage in debate rather than trying to twist arguments the way that he just had.  Saying such things as \"the country fared far better than the Deputy would have hoped\" is schoolboy stuff.  Let us have a proper debate about this.  As for incomes being protected, the Minister is well aware that the original proposal from the Government about maintaining incomes over the course of the pandemic provided for significantly less than the &euro;350 that public opinion forced it into implementing in the early days of the pandemic.  He is also aware of the fact that there is no such thing as a small enterprise in this country that makes &euro;800,000 in a year.  He is talking about big businesses and some medium-sized businesses, although the description of medium-sized businesses is inaccurate.  It refers to companies that employ several hundred people.  I would put forward for serious debate the idea that those companies should pay tax at the same rate on their profits as PAYE workers do on their income.  It is a reasonable proposition, which is worthy of further debate.  I will not get into all the rabbit holes that the Minister is trying to lead us down but certain points need to be answered.  I will press this to a voice vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#VV00500","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":821,"content":"<p>We do not often get a chance to debate these issues.  We do not make any apologies about using the opportunity in the Finance Bill and the budget to do so.  It is entirely legitimate.  While I am not satisfied that the 15% rate that we have gone to is sufficient, it has happened because of pressure, to be clear.  It was pressure from the few in this country who were willing to question the sacred cow of the 12.5% rate and from people around the world who are infuriated by the way in which these multinational corporations, in particular, are now so powerful that governments are terrified of them, and rob significant revenue from the poorer parts of the world.  They are deeply unhappy with the allocation.  The Minister said that we will lose revenue as a result of one of the pillars of the reallocation of revenues under the OECD process.  He will also know that poorer countries are furious that they are still being short-changed by what has happened.  They see it as being robbed.  They are angry that a more thorough reform of the corporate tax regime did not come out of the OECD process.  We make no apologies for continuously applying pressure regarding this matter.<\/p> <p>  I am an internationalist.  I make no apologies for trying to rebalance the taxation system so that the wealth that our society as a whole generates flows more to those working at the bottom than to Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and whatever coterie of multi-billionaires controls these corporations and wealth.  It has to happen and it will eventually happen.  This is part of the process.  The Minister's argument is that we would scare the horses and be on our own, then end up like Venezuela, that it would be a disaster, and that we would lose all the jobs in Leixlip.  I value those jobs.  I will say that again since sometimes I am accused of not valuing those jobs.  I want to see those jobs but I do not want those companies to have us over a barrel or, as a result of the fear that governments have of them, to not pay their fair share of tax.<\/p> <p>  I think the Minister was saying in his response that corporations pay a similar level of tax to lower income workers.  I have two points about that, which I mentioned earlier.  Workers in this country earn &euro;130 billion and pay &euro;27 billion in tax, which is approximately 20%.  Roughly 20% of the income earned by 2.8 million workers goes in tax.  Corporations have pre-tax profits of &euro;203 billion and pay &euro;11 billion in tax, which is 5.8%.  Our argument is that the effective rate for corporations is 5.8%, which are earning much more, whereas ordinary workers earn approximately 20%, and it would be fair to make corporations to pay at least that level of tax.  That would be good not just for this country but for the world.  We have to start somewhere and we should start there.  It is unsustainable to carry on with an economy that is so heavily skewed towards being controlled by these corporations.<\/p> <p>  I have a final point about the value of these assets.  The Minister pointed to an important debate, which we never have.  This is one of the few opportunities that we have to address the value of intangible assets.  I would like us to have that debate, so we table these amendments, because the matter needs to be scrutinised.  If I said to Revenue that I wanted to claim as a relief against my tax liability, the fact that I am paying my mum for a really good idea that she gave me, which has helped me to be a more productive economic unit and to which I ascribed a value, Revenue would laugh me out of the room.  If Revenue states that a certain amount of income tax should be paid based on income earned, it would laugh people out of the room if they said that they are paying their mum for a good idea that she had which made them more productive, and that it is an intangible asset, which is a cost that they will claim against their tax.  That is what the multinationals are doing.  They are laughing at us when they ascribe astronomical values to these intellectual property assets.  I am not saying that they have no value but there needs to be a hell of a lot more scrutiny into how they are valued and whether they can be valued such that profits that were &euro;200 billion then become &euro;111 billion.  There is a problem.  They are exploiting these categories of tax relief.  Everybody knows it but we are not really doing anything about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#VV00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 70, tabled by my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty.

Third, while we can remain competitive as a result of these changes, we can only do so if we address those factors that are just as crucial for investment in our economic competitiveness, including childcare, housing, research, development and education.  In so many of these areas, we have fallen behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#VV00700","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I dealt with a number of the issues that have been raised by Deputy Conway-Walsh in the exchange of views I had with Deputy Farrell.  I will return to some of the further points that were made by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I want to emphasise the point I made earlier.  According to the Deputy's argument, looking at the total amount of tax that is paid on the return from labour income, and comparing it to the total amount of tax that is paid on the return from capital, there is a disparity.  He argued that the return on capital is not taxed enough.  The point I make in response is that if one breaks down the effective tax rate on differing levels of income, the Deputy's argument does not hold in the way he is making it at the moment.  That will likely be the case if the OECD agreement is globally implemented, for three reasons: first, it is an agreement on a minimum effective tax rate and not a nominal rate; second, the impact of country-by-country reporting; and third, the US in particular will have the ability inside its tax regime to collect that minimum effective tax rate if it believes it is not being paid in a country in which an American company is active.<\/p> <p>  I go back to the figures I shared with the Deputy earlier on.  If he accepts that the figure will be 15%, or at least 15% in reality for many, comparing the effective tax rate on lower levels of income, it is lower than 15%.  It is lower.  That is relevant to the debate that we are having.  The argument the Deputy made earlier was the Piketty R and G argument, which is all about comparing the return between the two of them and how they are taxed.  In the world that we could be moving into, a big change is happening.  That is relevant to the charge the Deputy is making, because through the change that will happen between how larger companies are taxed and the tax that those on lower levels of income pay, the balance is changing.  I think it is really relevant to the debate we are having.  I agree with the Deputy that we do not always get a chance to debate the big issues enough in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I have really good news for Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I could be about to make his day, in fact.  I have been thinking about a point he made previously.

I will be brief as the meeting is running late.  The point was made, correctly, during the debates on the budget that there was the maintenance of tax relief for landlords, but no tax measures to assist renters.  That says a great deal.  On this particular tax relief for landlords, my understanding is that a landlord can claim tax relief for doing up or improving a property before letting it to a tenant.  I have heard Government Deputies speak about mom and pop landlords with only one or two properties to make the point that this will assist them and so forth.  Will the Minister clarify that this tax relief applies across the board, that entities such as Irish Residential Properties real estate investment trust, IRES REIT, and big corporate landlords can claim this tax relief for their hundreds or thousands of properties and that it is not just the small landlords who will benefit from it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#XX00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>On the question about how many properties this has brought back into use over recent years, in 2017 it was 1,225 and in 2018 it was 2,115.  It was just over 3,330 properties brought back into use.  That is over 3,000 tenants and their families who are now in refurbished rental accommodation that was not available to them before the landlord made use of this allowance.  In terms of what the cost of it has been, overall it is &euro;1 million.  It was &euro;300,000 in 2017 and &euro;700,000 in 2018.  On the question regarding where they are located geographically and what the levels of rent would be against those properties, I do not have that information available.  However, I would not imagine that information on the level of rent that would be relevant to these properties would be collected by the Revenue Commissioners as part of the process for this relief anyway.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked if I think this creates incentives that could be counterproductive, in other words, it might create an incentive for a property to go vacant and then for this relief to be claimed against it.  I am not sure that this is at a value that would justify that kind of behaviour.  The reason is that the deduction here is capped at &euro;5,000.  My judgment is that a gain of &euro;5,000 might not be enough for many landlords to decide to have a property vacant.  That is my sense, particularly bearing in mind that the other criterion here is that the property has to be vacant for at least 12 months.  Given the concerns we have regarding the level of rents, I do not believe many landlords will have a property entirely vacant for 12 months for the potential gain of &euro;5,000.<\/p> <p>  With regard to REITs and Irish real estate funds, IREFs, they are separate from this.  They are subject to their own tax regime.  The figures we have indicate that this is a tax relief that is being drawn on by multiple smaller landlords.  In 2017, it was 630 landlords overall who claimed the &euro;1.1 million against just over 1,200 properties and, in 2018, it was 1,030 tax payers who claimed it against 2,115 properties.  These figures indicate that it is multiple landlords with a small number of properties each, perhaps one or two, who are accessing this scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#XX00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"vote","time":1637020800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 3.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#YY00100","aye":["1558","1584","1626","1553","1473"],"nay":["1522","1501","1498"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>Sections 17 and 18 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":848,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 have been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#YY00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Sections 19 to 21, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":851,"content":"<p>  Amendment No. 27 has been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#YY00650","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 27 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":853,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":854,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 28 and 32 are related, and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#YY00900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 28:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 24, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Reports<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>22.<\/b>The Minister shall within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the revenue raised by excluding developments from section 21 where the development is a facility consisting of one or more than one structure, the combined gross floor space of which exceeds 10,000 square metres, used primarily for the storage, management and dissemination of data, and the provision of associated electricity connections infrastructure.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#YY01000","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":856,"content":"<p>The amendment is to exclude data centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#YY01100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":857,"content":"<p>The amendment relates to climate action and energy security.  It calls on the Department to carry out research into the total amount of capital allowances that a company has used against data centre investments to reduce their tax liabilities.  This would be interesting.  Under current law, companies may claim capital allowances against money invested in data centres to reduce or completely shelter their tax liability at a time when the security of supply of electricity for consumers is under threat.  It is clear that the proliferation of data centres in recent years poses a serious threat to the security of our electricity supply.  The regulator has warned that consumers face rolling blackouts without intervention.  EirGrid has predicted that data centres will account for between a quarter and a third of all electricity demand by 2030 and the increase in data centre demand for energy over the past four years is equivalent to 140,000 household connections each year.  The challenges faced by the system does have consequences for households and consumers, both in terms of energy security and rising costs.<\/p><p>Despite these risks, companies are offered lucrative tax incentives by the Government to invest in data centres here, spurring data centre proliferation and depriving the Exchequer of much needed revenue.  It is estimated that between 60% and 80% of all data centre expenditure qualifies for capital allowances and they can be used by companies against money spent on data equipment, installations and infrastructure in order to reduce or completely shelter their tax liabilities.  Given the threat posed by data centre demand, the tax incentives offered to companies to invest in them should be subject to greater scrutiny.  We can and should use the tax code to ensure that our energy system is secure and, where possible, amend it to encourage facilities such as data centres to source their energy in a way that is sustainable, climate neutral and protects our energy security.  The Minister and his officials should undertake an immediate review of the current tax relief in place for data centres, in terms of how much it has cost the State in the past and how much it could potentially cost in the future.

In general, such capital allowances are claimed at a rate of 12.5% annually, over eight years.<\/p> <p>  Data centres are treated in the same manner as any other business.  They may claim capital allowances on expenditure incurred on qualifying plant and machinery, where it is acquired and used for the purposes of the trade.  There is no special scheme applicable and, for that reason, I am advised by Revenue that capital allowance claims for data centres are not separately identifiable on Revenue records.  Furthermore, while the plant and machinery in data centres may qualify for capital allowances, I am also advised by Revenue that a building which houses a data centre is not an industrial building within the meaning of section 268 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and therefore the building itself does not qualify for industrial building capital allowances.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the accelerated capital allowance, ACA, scheme for energy efficient equipment, this allows taxpayers to deduct the full cost of expenditure on eligible equipment from taxable profits in the year of purchase, in place of the normal eight-year timeframe, where they invest in highly energy-efficient equipment.

Dealing with the rationale for what we are doing, the committee may recall hat last year I brought forward some amendments to transfer pricing and these garnered quite a reaction.  It became evident that legitimate business activities that many Irish companies are involved in were going to get caught up in the sweep of changes that we were looking to make and that was not our intention.  We recognised that certain legitimate domestic non-trading arrangements were not specifically provided for within the revised exclusion I had brought forward in last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  The non-exclusion of certain bona fide domestic non-trading transactions may have been problematic for certain Irish businesses who have intra-group arrangements and are subject to transfer pricing rules.  As a result, section 15 of the Finance Act 2020 was made subject to a commencement order.  This was to allow my officials, in consultation with officials of the Revenue Commissioners, sufficient time to further consider, prior to commencing the legislation, the scope and application of the section.<\/p> <p>  Following this process, section 27 of this year&rsquo;s Bill substitutes a new section for section 835E of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  It has a number of important modifications compared to the section that we provided for in the Finance Act 2019.  It will remove any doubt that the exclusion applies to the specific arrangement that falls within the provision as opposed to the wider activities of the entities involved.  It also provides for an exclusion from the application of transfer pricing rules to the computation of non-trading income in certain circumstances.  Provided certain conditions are satisfied, the exclusion will apply in respect of a transaction between certain associated persons who are both chargeable to tax in the State on the profits or gains or losses arising from the transaction, or who would be so chargeable if there were any.  Where the supplier meets this requirement but the acquirer does not, the exclusion will only apply where the acquirer is chargeable to tax on any profits or gains or losses arising from its relevant activities, or would be so chargeable if there were any, and is resident in the State.<\/p> <p>  In addition to containing a similar anti-avoidance provision to that which was included in section 835E, as introduced by Finance Act 2019, which related to scenarios involving certain back-to-back arrangements, I have also included further anti-avoidance measures.<\/p><p>The exclusion will only apply where an arrangement has been entered into for legitimate commercial reasons.  It will not apply where the main purpose, in the view of the Revenue Commissioners, is the avoidance of tax or where, due to the existence of the arrangement, a deduction or some form of relief for the purposes of tax would be available to the acquirer which is greater than the actual consideration payable under the arrangement.<\/p><p> As regards the orphan tax issue raised by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, transfer pricing rules apply in respect of transactions involving two persons who are associated.  For the purposes of the rules, two persons are associated if one person participates in the management, control or capital of another person, or the same person is participating in the management, control or capital of both persons.  To qualify for the exclusion, both parties to the transaction must be a qualifying person.  Under the existing legislation and the new legislation, a qualifying company within the meaning of section 110 is specifically precluded from being a qualifying person.  This means that a non-trading transaction entered into with an associated company that is a section 110 company cannot avail of the exclusion and transfer pricing rules will apply.  The short answer is that the orphan companies to which the Deputy referred will not be able to benefit from this change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#AAA01700","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":887,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Aire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#BBB00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":888,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett has a question on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#BBB00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I appreciate the explanation, but pardon me if what is happening here is still less than crystal clear.

Can he give us an example of what type of non-trading transaction, if I understand it correctly, between associated companies was being unfairly caught up in the sweep of what are sort of anti-avoidance rules and measures, so that we can understand that what he is doing is not going to open unintended consequences from which companies can benefit or allow them to exploit the relief, if you like, or the extension of the relief?

I refer to the treatment of REITs and IREFs.  My apologies; extra notes are being sent in to me.  I have enough in front of me already.  As the Minister is aware, these entities do not pay corporation tax on rental profits or capital gains tax on disposal of their assets.  Those are tax advantages that domestic landlords and other companies do not enjoy.  In May, an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that institutional property investors or IREFs paid an effective tax rate of 17.9% in 2020, based on taxable events in 2019.  That figure was referenced by the Minister in his reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Doherty, in June.  Indeed, speaking on a radio programme this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, claimed that on any profits being made there is a tax of 20% or 25%, depending on the structure, and any profits they make are taxed at the higher rate, double the rate of corporation tax.  However, I do not think that is the case.  The figure of 17.9% related to the taxable event, meaning distributions to shareholders, and was not relative to rental profits.  In 2019, tax paid by IREFs relating to pre-tax profits was 9.1%, less than the 25% paid by any other landlord or the 12.5% paid by any other company.  Furthermore, they are exempt from capital gains tax entirely.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in disagrees with the Minister on this policy issue.  We believe the tax advantages enjoyed by these funds are pricing struggling home buyers out of the market and simply driving up rents.<\/p><p>We also know that these funds, in the vast majority of cases, are buying up properties subject to forward purchase agreements, not forward funding agreements, despite the commentary.  These amendments call for reports, as we in Sinn F&eacute;in have done every year.  In a report published in February 2019 by the Department of Finance, entitled Institutional Investment in the Housing Market, it was noted:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere is a risk that, should BTR investment continue at current growth rates, market forces would over the long term create socio-economic polarisation in some urban areas.  Under such a scenario average income earners would be priced out of purchasing or renting from the private market ...<br \/><br \/>... there is a risk that at sufficient scale an institutional investor or group of investors could, over time, develop monopolistic or oligopolistic pricing power. <\/blockquote><p>The Minister may be of the view that the housing policy the Government has pursued over the past decade has been a roaring success but, as he will know from my earlier comments, I disagree with that not only on a philosophical basis but also on the basis of the record.  The power of investment funds within the housing market has to be reigned in.  This threat is being recognised elsewhere as well.  We have seen the Liberal Party of Canada commit to measures to clamp down on the financialisation of the housing market in Canada.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have a very different view of the success of Government housing policy and its impact on affordability.  I raised this earlier, but we need to look very clearly now.  We are at a crisis point in respect of affordability of housing.  We are all aware of that from our clinics and from talking to people in our neighbourhoods.  We are very much aware of the huge impact this is having on people.  Anything that can be done to try to assist with affordability really needs to be done.<br\/><br\/>This amendment just calls for a report.  No matter where the suggestions come from, whether from us, although we are in opposition, or from others, they should be looked at seriously.  Anything that can help to deal with the affordability crisis we see should be taken into consideration because we are at a crisis point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#BBB01400","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I believe that when the history books are written, what happened with the property and housing sector in this country after the crash, with the tax set-up and the political decision, as I see it, to invite investment vehicles into the country to \"refloat\" the Irish property sector, will turn out to be one of the greatest mistakes ever made in this State.  It has contributed directly to the housing disaster we now face.  It is bad enough that NAMA has got &euro;40 billion in cash for the property it has sold and unloaded so far, mostly to these types of vehicles, from 2012 and 2013 onwards, when it should have used that property portfolio to provide affordable and public housing; what is worse is that we would not be in the mess we are in had it not done so.<\/p> <p>  To add insult to injury, the investment vehicles are benefiting from all these tax reliefs, whereby they do not pay tax on rental income and do not pay capital gains tax.  That is shocking beyond belief.  It has contributed directly, not just from the point of view of morals or how shocking it is, to an utterly dysfunctional housing sector and to human misery in the form of the housing crisis.  These entities did not come in to create a sustainable housing sector in Ireland.  That is not why they came here and it is not what they have done.  They came here to make money.  That is what they have done, and they will not pay much tax for having done so.  I think about how rents have gone up and how the value of property has gone up to a staggering level, all of which these property investment vehicles have benefited from to a staggering degree.  Then, to add to that, these real estate investment trusts, real estate funds and so on have benefited from tax breaks.<\/p> <p>  One thing I have always found particularly unacceptable, from the point of view of a member of the finance committee, is that we do not really know how much revenue is forgone in this regard.  For the most part, when there are tax breaks and tax reliefs, we can ask the question how much tax is forgone, as we have done before.  The Minister may give us new information, but I think I am right in saying we are not told - or told it cannot be calculated or something - how much tax has been forgone from the tax breaks on these entities' rental revenue and capital gains.  It is pretty awful from a budgetary point of view and a finance point of view that we just do not know or are not given the figures or that the amount cannot be calculated, whatever the reason is.  Therefore, to look into these figures, as these amendments propose to do, and assess their impact on the housing market and price dynamics is the very least we can do in order that we can have an informed debate on the advantages these entities enjoy.  Obviously, the Government will say that these arrangements are beneficial, that we need these property investors and that somehow they are contributing, although it is totally lost on me how they are contributing in any shape or form to a sustainable housing sector.  Maybe the Minister will be able change my mind.  I doubt it.  At the very least, we need to look into and scrutinise these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#CCC00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":902,"content":"<p>As we look back and ask ourselves the quite legitimate questions Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised, we may come up with a different answer to the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>used at the time, that is, that investment companies had to be invited into the State in order to generate movement in the banking sector.  There was nobody to whom people could apply to borrow.  There was no money in the system.  The system was broken.  It was stalled in the water and withering on the vine.  That, in a business context, as members will know readily, cannot prevail.  We were getting to a situation, which I saw happening in some countries, in which the ATMs had nothing to offer, which was a frightening thought.  That is the stage at which it comes home to the individual householder and the person who quite rightly raises such questions.<\/p><p>The question as to whether or not these companies have outlived their usefulness is a different issue, but there are two very different situations.  There is the one that prevailed at the time, when there was no money in the country, no movement in financial circles and property values of all descriptions were on the bottom and going down fast.  There were some cases in which properties were devalued by as much as 90% of the original value.  I saw them on the market.  That could not continue.  If it had remained that way for a while longer, the natural follow-up would have been emigration re-accelerated at a scale never known before.<\/p><p>There were, therefore, reasons at that stage to invite in the financial companies and financial investors, now known as vulture funds.  I do not like vulture funds and I do not like some of the things they do.  I have had to deal with them on behalf of constituents, which I will continue to do, hopefully with reasonably good effect.  However, we need to know what happened at the time.  There is a historical version of this that has to be borne in mind when absorbing the information now available in the ether and the marketplace.  By all means, we have a right to ask questions now about these companies' <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>, and we are all aware of cases in which the impaired loans have been sold on to financial companies.  Financial investment companies are now in the business of disposing of them and taking them over.  I raised this question repeatedly when nobody else in the House was raising it, long before the question was asked as to whether and to what extent unregulated third parties would come under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank.  They were not originally under its jurisdiction and, to my mind, they are only partially under it now.<\/p><p> The fact remains it is legitimate to raise the question as to how we deal with this now.  It falls on us as public representatives to decide how we should react.  I acknowledge the Opposition's point of view.  I would probably do the same myself, although I have my doubts about it.  The Government gets the blame for everything from the weather to the lack of moonlight, so it is covered in respect of both day and night.  Nevertheless, we need to examine this in a somewhat different light because circumstances are different.  This is about large investment companies making a massive profit from selling somebody's property, that is, somebody's misery.  We all have appalling stories to tell about dealing with the banks, which have been regulated over the past eight or ten years but the problems have not subsided with the passage of time.  In the past week, I have had to deal with a number of cases and next week I will deal with a further number of cases.  The situation has become pressing from the point of view of people who took out mortgages in good faith and fell by the wayside because of the domino effect.  Once the crash came, it came in its totality.  Nobody was spared from it, and even ten, 12 or 14 years later, they are still suffering.  The ultimate suffering will now take place because they are in danger of being made homeless all together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#CCC00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":904,"content":"<p>When we are debating the role of REITs and IREFs, it is important to embed the debate within the overall Government policy with regard to housing, which is one of investment and planning for all forms of housing.

In the first six months of 2021, 2,433 new social homes were directly built by the State.  A total of 3,600 new social homes were delivered.  That is relevant to the discussion we are having because in this context it is sometimes portrayed that the only provider in scale of homes within our State are the REITs and IREFs.  It is portrayed by some that the Government does not play an active role in the building of new homes, but it does.  They are the figures for where we are this year.  More than 3,600 new social homes have been built, with 8,750 social homes now on site, being built as we speak.<\/p> <p>  The question then becomes how we can deliver our goals of more homes being built that are available for private rental accommodation or that could be purchased without the State playing an active role.  As a country, do we want savings held in other countries to play a role in the delivery of homes by the private sector in Ireland, underneath the terminology of REITs, IREFs and all the other technical language?  Do we want the savings that exist in other parts of Europe and the world to be used to build homes in Ireland while the State builds more and more homes directly?  I believe the answer to that question is \"Yes\".<\/p> <p>  Look at the size of our country.  Two banks will be available to provide most of the credit we will need to build up to 20,000 homes per year through the private sector.  Ours is a small open economy on the edge of Europe.  To those who say they do not want savings that are held elsewhere to play a role in the private sector delivering either more apartments, primarily for rental, which I accept, or homes for purchase in a small number of cases, the question is: if they do not want the savings that are held elsewhere to do it, who they want to do it?  Currently, the answer always appears to be that they want the Government to do all that, to build more and fund more.<\/p> <p>  Already in 2020, however, the Government is building 13,100 of the 20,600 homes we believe will be delivered next year, either directly or, if not fully building them, it is enabling their delivery through, for example, cost-rental homes or the new affordable housing scheme the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is delivering.  For next year, the Government will be either directly building or co-funding and enabling the delivery of half of all new homes.  If we want the Government to do more than that, the question is whether it is sustainable that, year after year, the Government would build or fund the delivery of more than half of new homes.  I think we will get to the point where there are limits to what the Government can do.  The question then is whether private savings can play a role, particularly in the delivery of more apartments.<\/p> <p>  We are getting to the point where, despite the country clearly having an intense housing challenge, most elements of the Opposition are against any moves to increase the supply of homes.  That is where I think we are.  It is certainly the case that at least some of the Opposition do not want REITs or IREFs to be present in Ireland at all.  If that is the case, the responsibility sits with them to explain how, in particular, the apartments these entities play a role in funding will be built.  How else will that happen?<\/p> <p>  The charge that these entities do not pay tax is wrong.  According to the latest set of information available to me, up to 30 September 2021, REITs paid dividend-withholding tax of &euro;15 million, while IREFs, which have been the subject of a fair bit of debate within this committee, went from paying &euro;8.3 million in tax in 2017 to &euro;71.9 million in 2020.<\/p> <p>  These financial instruments play a role in delivering some new supply within our country.  The Government is playing a larger role; the largest purchaser of new housing stock is the State.  As these organisations have become more active, although they are still far less active than many would acknowledge, they have played a role in boosting the supply of apartments.  Given the dire shortage of rental accommodation, surely there is a case for saying we are willing to allow money other people save to play a role in allowing Irish housing needs to be met.<\/p><p>This is at a time when we, as a State, are spending more than we ever have previously on building homes either directly or indirectly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#DDD00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":906,"content":"<p>It is ten o'clock so I must adjourn the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#EEE00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":907,"content":"<p>To clarify, will we vote on this tomorrow?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#EEE00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I will be chairing the meeting tomorrow as well and my intention is to recommence with the opportunity for members to speak on these two points then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#EEE00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111600002#EEE00500","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":910,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637020800,"counter":911,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 10 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 November 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Committee On Health","time":1637020800,"counter":912},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 11:00<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 11:00<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Neasa Hourigan, Martin Conway, Mark Ward.

The commission is an independent statutory body established in April 2002 under the provisions of the Mental Health Act.  The principal functions of the commission are to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.  We register and inspect all approved mental health centres in the State.  The commission's vision, as set out in its strategic plan is the highest quality mental health and decision-support services underpinned by a person's human rights.  The remit of the commission was extended by the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015, which provided for the establishment of the decision support service.<\/p> <p>  The Bill will establish a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults who have difficulty in making decisions without help.  As the independent regulator of mental health services and the State agency with responsibility for the 2001 Act, it is an enormous privilege to input into the legislation which shall assist in improving mental health services in Ireland for years to come.  In July and August 2019, the Department provided the commission with copies of the heads of a Bill to amend the 2001 Act.  This was a unique opportunity for which I thank the Department and the Minister.  On receipt of the heads of the Bill in July 2019, we established an executive working group, the terms of reference for which were approved by the leadership team and the board of the commission.  There then followed a series of meetings of the working group on each part of the heads and certain specific sections, such as the guiding principles and capacity and consent.  The working group then met the commission&rsquo;s legislation committee to look in detail at all parts.  A draft submission was presented to the board of the commission in February 2020 and, subject to certain amendments, the submission was approved and sent to the Department of Health in early March 2020.  A similar process was then followed on the proposed new part of the 2001 Act relating to children.<\/p> <p>  We raised a number of key points in our submissions.  The commission adopted a practical person-centred and rights-based approach when reviewing the heads of Bill and making its submissions to the Department.  We identified and raised issues in almost every section of the Act.  The executive summaries provided to the committee give an indication of the issues the commission has sought to address.  Some of the key changes are to ensure parity of mental health issues to general health issues and to extend the regulatory remit of the commission to 24-hour residential mental health services and all community mental health services.<\/p> <p>  When the 2001 Act was reviewed by the expert group, the part relating to regulation did not receive the same attention as some of the other parts.  This is not a criticism but a comment.  The commission recommended that mental health services be divided into three categories.  These are approved in-patient facilities, which are covered at present, approved community residences, which the Department has confirmed in writing should be subject to regulation, and approved community mental health services, which include all the community services set out in A Vision for Change and Sharing the Vision.  The commission also recommended that the relevant part of the 2001 Act should be retitled \"Regulation\" and the various stages of regulation, including registration, inspection, monitoring and enforcement, should be clearly set out.  The commission also recommended that the approved centre regulations of 2006 be amended in parallel to the Act.  It also sought to separate measures relating to restrictive practices from treatment measures.  The commission does not agree with the inclusion of restrictive measures in Part 4 of the 2001 Act and recommended that a separate part of the Act deal with restrictive practices and the rules relating to them.  Treatment and restrictive practices are two different things.<\/p> <p>  We also sought to reform the provisions relating to consent, capacity as linked to the 2015 Act and the administration of medication.  This part of the heads of the Bill was the subject of significant discussion, with the result that a number of amendments have been recommended.  Issues considered included the 2015 Act, the changes in the area of consent and the rights-based approach advocated by the UNCRPD.  The commission wants to ensure that guiding principles are introduced to replace the best interest test and that they are patient-centred and work in the context of mental health.  The commission also wants to ensure the remit of the mental health tribunals and those of the Circuit Court for the benefit of patients.  This is often forgotten but it is a significant function when people are deprived of their liberty.  The commission recommended a number of smaller changes in this area to include supporting the move to all applications for involuntary admission being made by authorised officers, who are people who understand mental health, with no applications to be made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We recommend that the section on bringing a person to an approved centre against his or her will be the subject of review by a mental health tribunal, which is now called a review board, involving the other members of a person's team in the admission or renewal process.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting the commission has objected to the insertion of intermediate admission and renewal orders, which were not in the heads of the Bill as provided to us in July 2019.  These provisions were suggested by the expert review group to fill a gap that existed prior to the 2015 Act but the 2015 Act has addressed the issue of capacity.  Therefore, it is the commission&rsquo;s view that these provisions are no longer required.  Furthermore, in the commission&rsquo;s opinion the provisions in the general scheme would undermine the 2001 and 2015 Acts and fundamentally change what is being proposed.<\/p><p>The board of the commission is concerned at the inclusion of these provisions.  They go against everything that we are trying to achieve in terms of parity for people with mental health issues.<\/p><p> In regard to the new Part relating to children, the commission welcomes that the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are working on various aspects of this new Part of the Act.  There are number of issues which the commission believes are important to include, such as that each child should be appointed a legal representative from the beginning of an involuntary detention process to its conclusion.  The commission is of the view that this is the best way to ensure that the voice of the child is heard.  Furthermore, the commission could extend its legal aid scheme to deal with the appointment of such legal representatives.  There needs to be separate provisions relating to children under 16 years and those who are 16 to 17 years old.  There should be a statutory provision for the furnishing of information to the children and their parents-guardians.  The provisions in the 2001 Act need to stand alone from those in the child care legislation and there is need for greater involvement of children in the process in terms of attending court remotely and having a say in proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Farrelly.

Head 13, section 12 deals with the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take into custody a person believed to fulfil criteria for involuntary detention and provides that the commission may, in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other relevant body, prepare a code of practice on the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under this Act.  It provides that the commission \"may\" prepare a code of practice in regard to the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under this Act in consultation with relevant bodies following on from a recommendation of the March 2021 public consultation.  The recommendation further states that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be adequately trained in regard to both their powers under the Act and how best to handle a situation involving persons expressing mental distress.  Should the word \"may\" be substituted with the word \"shall\" to ensure that the training and trauma informed care form part of this Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#B00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Keane, our general counsel, to answer that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I agree it should be \"shall\".

That has to be done by an authorised officer.  That is a significant move.  The second issue is that the time period for which somebody can be held in custody is now down to 12 hours.  The commission has asked for a shorter period.  We would ask the committee to consider that.  People detained for drink driving and so on are detained for only very short periods of three and six hours.  We would ask the committee to consider reducing that time period further.  As the committee will appreciate for a person in custody in a Garda station who is unwell that is a very intimidating and difficult environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keane.

There are approximately 113 or 114 24-hour supervised residences, each with up to eight or nine people in them, which means there are approximately 1,200 people in 24-hour residential facilities.

They were in the revised Bill we received in March or April of this year, which was a bit of a surprise.  The issue is that to involuntarily detain somebody against his or her will is a major issue and can only be done in accordance with the law.  There are very specific criteria for involuntarily detaining somebody and the revised criteria for that are set out in section 8.  This Bill allows for the involuntary detention of a person because of mental health issues.  The issue that was raised by the expert group and which has been put in by way of the intermediate admission and renewal orders relates to capacity.  The remit of this legislation is being fundamentally extended to deal with issues of capacity.  Those issues have been dealt with in the 2015 legislation.  The commission, in its review of the legislation, has also made a number of recommendations to the Department.  One applies to a situation of somebody who is either voluntarily or involuntarily detained and a lack of capacity is recognised.  We have suggested a mechanism to allow such a person to transfer or transition to the 2015 Act.<\/p> <p>  Our concern is that people under this Act are going to be detained because of the criteria for mental illness.  There is then a new category of people who the Department is saying are not detained but are going to receive the same oversight.  Effectively, the commission will then be reviewing people as to their capacity.  That is not one of our fundamental functions.  We are also concerned about the fact that the commission is the owner or operator, for want of a better phrase, of both the Mental Health Act and the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act.  We have a fundamental difficulty because we would be setting up a parallel process of reviewing capacity under the Mental Health Act when all those issues should be dealt with under the 2015 Act.<\/p> <p>  We sent a memo to the Department setting out our concerns in that regard.  When we got the general scheme of the Bill, as approved by Cabinet, we noted the problem was still there and, on that basis, we then brought it to the commission members.  <\/p> <p>  We also have a fundamental concern about the situation of a person who does not meet the criteria for detention, who may lack capacity and is going to be detained.<\/p><p>I do not know what legal advice has been obtained by the Department as it has not shared that with us.  We would have a concern that, legally, that might not even be sound.  Fundamentally, it is introducing a new issue about assessing capacity into the mental health legislation, which is not the function of the legislation.  Second, it is introducing a parallel system of capacity, which has already been dealt with in the 2015 Act.  Our concern is that it would undermine the 2015 Act.  <\/p><p> If I may add a further point, our further concern is that even if these orders were introduced and they were intermediate admission orders for 21 days, in order for the person to be assessed in terms of capacity to see if he or she should be brought under the 2015 Act, that would be something, but the scheme also proposes these intermediate admission orders would be extended for three months or a further six months and that goes completely against-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#D01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":973,"content":"<p>Through the renewal order, is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#E00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":974,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":975,"content":"<p>Therefore, somebody could be detained for the best part of a year without a decision being made on his or her capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#E00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":976,"content":"<p>In fairness, the Department is proposing these people would be subject to review by the review board on the issue of capacity but we are saying that would be running a complete parallel system to that which is proposed under 2015 Act and that risks undermining that Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":977,"content":"<p>This might be a simplistic question.

It might be helpful to describe the procedure which this intermediate category solution bypasses.  Under the 2015 Act there would be a process where there is a question mark over somebody&rsquo;s capacity and where under that Act, and all the guiding principles it contains, everything has been done to support the person to make his or her own decisions, including decisions around healthcare and treatment.  There is then a route to court, which is the Circuit Court, to make a declaration about a person&rsquo;s capacity in respect of discrete items, which in this case would presumably be consent to treatments for a mental health issue.  If the court in that case were to find capacity was lacking it then can make an order appointing a decision-making representative who would then, ideally, be somebody in a pre-existing relationship of trust or failing that, a person appointed from a panel to be maintained by the decision support service who would act within the strict terms of a time-limited decision-making representation order to act as agent, having regard at all times to the person&rsquo;s will and preferences and who would be in a position to  supply the necessary consents if that were to be required.

As Dr. Finnerty pointed out, it is important that the 2006 regulations are revised in parallel with the Act so that they include detail on the appropriate premises standards.  The commission will then be able to make an assessment as to whether a premises will comply with those regulations when determining whether a facility should be registered.

I asked a question on this at our last meeting on this topic.  The expert group did not recommend an independent route for making complaints.  When I asked about this I was told that they were pretty much the same thing.  However, they are not really because there is no independent body to which people can make complaints.  What are the representatives' thoughts on that?  Does the system proposed in this Bill provide parity of esteem between mental health and physical health, particularly as there is no independent route by which to make complaints while there is such a route for other health issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#F01200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":999,"content":"<p>I will speak to that initially.  The Act is quite strong.  I do not really understand the Senator's point regarding an independent complaints mechanism.  I do not understand what people are articulating when they talk about an independent complaints body.  If you are receiving a general health service and something goes wrong, you have the right to make a complaint to the body.  That body should have a complaints process in place which includes independent elements.  The HSE has that in place.  We have regulations in place under which complaints must be acted upon and a process undertaken and we can monitor that.  If the complainant is not happy with the HSE, he or she can go to the Ombudsman.  It is the same process as for complaints regarding general health.  I am not quite sure what people mean when they talk about an independent body.  The culture around complaints should be such that they go to the people involved who then learn from it.  Perhaps this is a little bit about people not trusting the provider to deal with complaints.  Perhaps that is what is coming out.  If that is the case, there is an onus on the provider to be even more transparent.  I would suggest that what gives an added edge and is useful in this Bill is the introduction of the patient advocacy service and the ability to make applications to it.  This will be for all community mental health services as well.  People will be able to receive support from the patient advocacy service, where needed.  That will strengthen the Act.

That has never happened before and people were worried about it because they somehow felt that it was something that should not be discussed or that it was a private matter, but it is not.  It is a public matter.  We will be putting strong rules in place with regard to seclusion and restrictive practices and people will have to work within them.  It will be an offence under the Act not to.  If there are breaches of these rules, prosecution will be our next step.  The first prosecution under the Mental Health Act 2001 happened a couple of years ago and related to seclusion.  As far as the commission is concerned, there absolutely should be strategies in place and we should go this way.  However, at the same time, we will not tolerate breaches of the rules.

We are undergoing a process to underpin those rules with rigorous evidence and literature review to ensure they are clear to everybody, that they are workable in approved inpatient facilities and that they require people to use restraint only as a very last resort when they have demonstrated that all other appropriate alternatives have been considered.

In an earlier version of the heads of the Bill that we are looking at today, section 136 of the 2015 Act was going to be repealed.  There was also an earlier version of the heads of the Bill to amend the 2015 Act, which addressed that, so it remains an outstanding issue in terms of to what extent people have access to the full supports and decision-making opportunities provided for under the 2015 Act when their treatment is regulated under the Mental Health Act.  If we can arrive at a resolution of that issue, then any person in an approved inpatient facility should be made aware of the 2015 Act.

What rights do long-term patients in an approved centre have if a centre is due to be closed and they do not want to leave it because they consider it their home, in spite of the recommendations to shut the centre?<\/p> <p>  How frustrated do the witnesses get if they commission a full report on a centre and two years later they go back to do another report on the same building and make the same recommendations, or perhaps more, and they have not been carried out and the same could happen a third time?  They find that none of their recommendations have been addressed.  After three or four reports over four to eight years, despite all the recommendations being approved, nothing is done and then the commission is faced with the scenario of shutting the centre because it is not fit for purpose.  If the recommendations of previous reports had been acted on, the premises should be up to standard.  How does the commission get around that?<\/p> <p>  My main concern is that we have a centre that is due to close.  I refer to the Owenacurra centre.  It has 19 long-term patients.  It also caters for short-term stays and it has mental health day services.  Three or four reports have been done by the Mental Health Commission and recommendations have been made on the building over a period of years.  I have read all the reports and seen all the recommendations and yet nothing was done to the centre.  Now we have a scenario where we are talking about people's rights.  Some people are happy to move on.  Dr. Finnerty referred to the fact that moving a patient from one centre to another does not always mean it is a better or more appropriate place.  The current scenario is that patients in the centre do not want to go anywhere.  I have spoken to many of them.  One patient said to me that it is his forever home.  He thought he was going to die there.  Where is the protection for the patients?  What power does the commission or this committee have to ensure the safety of each and every one of these patients, but also that they have the capacity to make up their own mind and make the decision?  If the decision is to remain in the centre where they are now, can the HSE force people to move to another place?  I suspect that the new centre will be less appropriate because some of them are locked down for 12 hours and others are in very sparse areas while the current centre is integrated into the town and the patients are likewise integrated.  It is a rights issue.  I know there is a lot in it, but I would welcome if the witnesses could help me in this regard because it is a problem that has arisen in recent weeks and it is very hard to get answers for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#G00700","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637020800,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>The existing Act does not prohibit any provider from closing a centre.

It requires that the existing provider follows up for a period of three months afterwards on their ongoing care.  It also provides that they make the appropriate assessments to ensure that their ongoing placement is appropriate for them and is in keeping with their needs.

They have to be decent units that give people dignity and hope.  That will be a challenge for Ireland.  There are a number of centres.  We have taken a position that centres should be good enough to give people hope and dignity.  That will involve the HSE.  Many premises have improved a lot over the last few years.  We have identified premises to the HSE both at a regional and national level.  Some regions are better at keeping their stock up to date than other regions, which is unfortunate for patients in those regions.  With regard to Sl&aacute;intecare and the reform of the HSE, no one is saying that the HSE does not need to be reformed and improved.  Even the HSE recognises that.

All that would do would be to cause a rupture in quality improvement and in addressing the complaints of a person.  If people in an approved centre are not treated properly, they can make a complaint, which must be brought through the complaints process.  The provider is required by law to investigate it.  We monitor that.  To put it a different way, from a quality perspective, it is through complaints, learning and openness that services are improved.  If that is taken away from providers, they will not necessarily improve their service.  If the Ombudsman is not happy with the service, or if we find an issue with a centre not properly investigating complaints, we will identify that.  We do not really find that.  I do not think that this would be helpful in the legislation.  I think that it would cause more confusion than it would solve.<\/p> <p>  I think it is more helpful for the legislation to address advocacy and for people to be welcome to complain.  There should be a culture of complaining being a good thing, because that is how you improve the system.  The advocates would help people to complain when they need to.  It is the same as any other part of the health system.  If you were in hospital in Tallaght and had a complaint, you would want to address that to the people looking after you in Tallaght and then escalate it.

We have four CAMHS units plus two private units in the country.  At any given time, the number of beds varies in those four units.  It is dependent on a number of things, such as that the resourcing of the teams in the unit is high enough or that there are enough beds to admit the person.  A further difficulty is that, sometimes, given the design of some of the units and if a child is critically troubled or disturbed, the unit may not be able to take somebody else into that particular part of the unit, which reduces the bed capacity.<\/p> <p>  That gives a background of what is available in CAMHS.  It is not ideal that those under 18 are admitted to adult units.  There is a code of practice on the admission of children.  There is no adult unit in the country that would meet the standards in the code of practice because the code of practice outlines very clearly that certain therapeutic activities and programmes appropriate to that age group should be provided, and obviously they are not, and also that the layout and facilities are conducive to treating somebody under the age of 18, and they are not.  Invariably, if we discover a child has been admitted to an adult unit, the unit is non-compliant with the code of practice.<\/p> <p>  In practice, we found the admissions are short in general, usually a day or two, maybe a little longer.  There is really no emergency provision of beds for young people.  There is one bed in Galway and Linn Dara at Cherry Orchard in Dublin provides an emergency service but not necessarily a bed.  Therefore, there is sometimes literally nowhere for the child to go, so they need for their own safety to be admitted to an adult unit.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of areas in the CAMHS services, including the community services, which need to be strengthened.  There will be provision of more beds with the children's hospital but we also need emergency beds and emergency provision of services to catch those young people who are in distress in the middle of the night and require somewhere that is safe for them to be until the situation can be looked at.

That started a discussion between the two Departments.  We understand that, because of Covid, that was put aside but there has been re-engagement with them again about this.  We also met with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland in September 2020 and, following that, we contacted the Department and suggested that the child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists from the college were open and willing to give input to the Department, and that has also happened.  It is very much collaborative because everybody has little bits of the story to add.<\/p> <p>  In terms of consultation with this group, the commission has undertaken three extensive consultation processes involving service users, the most recent being on the rules and codes, which my colleague, Mr. Kiernan, has undertaken.  We also involved service users in our strategic plan.  We will be suggesting either to the Department or, indeed, to ourselves, if we end up doing rules and codes for children, that we involve them in that process.  We had one of the child and adult adolescent groups, SpunOut, speak to the commission last year so we already have some contacts with those groups.  We would hope some of the advocacy services could help and support us in progressing that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the children's part of the Act, from my perspective, I was there in November 2006 when the 2001 Act was commenced, and there was only one section relating to children.  This will be a major new departure and it is very welcome.  However, there are a couple of issues I would ask the committee to look at.  Some of the time periods in the Act relating to children are quite long.  A child who is voluntary in an approved centre can be made involuntary but that takes 72 hours whereas for an adult, it takes 24 hours.  Three days for a child is a very long time.  In addition, the court can make orders for 21 days and three months.  We had recommended to the Department that these orders should be for 14 days.  Again, and we all see this during Covid, being in lockdown for three months is a very long time, so for a child to be on an order for three months is a very long time.  That is something we would ask the committee to look at and maybe recommend that those periods be reduced.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that there is provision for ECT and for the commission to provide rules in regard to ECT.  The commission, in its submissions, made some queries to the Department as to whether it had looked at international best practice and things like that.  Again, the committee might revert to the Department and maybe tease out a little more the merits of ECT for children at 16 and 17 years.  If it is the case that children are to receive ECT, the commission will then do a separate process in terms of the appropriate rules in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is that it is imperative that children have their own legal representation.  It was a recommendation the commission put forward and one the Department has taken on board.  We really want to maintain it because the children have to have a voice.<\/p> <p>  The final point is the new world we live in regarding technology.  We are all here today and many of us are attending remotely.  Children, particularly 16 and 17-year-olds, should be able to attend hearings relating to them remotely.  I know that can be a challenge with some of the District Courts and Circuit Courts because of the facilities available to them, but many of them have had a lot of work done over the last while.  I would really promote that provision.  The more that children can be involved in the process and what is going on, the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>I call Senator Aisling Dolan, who has just arrived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021111600002#K00500","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1637020800,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I have some general questions.

One of the Senator&rsquo;s colleagues, who promoted the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, introduced that concept, which also aligns with the guiding principles in the 2015 Act.<\/p> <p>  The guiding principles here set out how people should approach dealing with matters on behalf of persons.  The person should be involved and if he or she has difficulties comprehending things, all relevant supports should be given.  One should not use more information than is possible and one should not give information to other people unless it is relevant and necessary.  This is very much bringing the person into the centre and having his or her will and preference as a key issue in how one goes about making decisions for the person if he or she is, as in some cases, an involuntary patient.
