I am pleased to be here.  I thank the committee for taking this matter this morning.  I am joined by officials, Mr. Patrick McCabe and Mr. John Dunphy.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the motions is to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for Ireland to opt-in to Regulation 2018\/1726 which relates to the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, or eu-LISA for short.  Ireland already participates in the eu-LISA agency on the basis of our opt-in to eu-LISA establishing Regulation EU\/1077\/2011 which is repealed by this regulation.   It is therefore necessary for Ireland to opt in to the new regulation which strengthens the mandate of eu-LISA.<\/p> <p>As a European Union agency, eu-LISA has effectively contributed to the establishment of a co-ordinated, effective and coherent IT environment for the management of large-scale freedom, security and justice IT systems.  euLisa has enabled the pooling of expertise, the harnessing of synergies and allowed a more flexible framework than was possible when the systems were developed and managed by the commission, with certain tasks entrusted to public sector bodies in two member states.  The new regulation will benefit member states and agencies who are end users of the relevant large scale IT systems by enhancing the role of eu-LISA with regard to future developments in IT systems and providing support to member states when required.  Ireland has representatives who attend the advisory groups in respect of the IT systems in which we participate which are the SIS II and Eurodac.  Representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also participate in the management board of eu-LISA which, among other tasks, appoints and oversees the work of the agency&rsquo;s executive director.<\/p> <p>The support of eu-LISA and our other partner member states has been invaluable to Ireland in the development of our own solutions for these large scale IT systems.  The participation of euLISA is of particular importance for the Garda&rsquo;s project to connect to the Schengen information system, SIS II.  Technical experts from eu-LISA have been involved both on the ground in Dublin and through web attendance at workshops on topics such as data migration.  euLisa, working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to build and test the systems necessary to ensure that Ireland is in a position to go live on SIS II early next year.<\/p> <p>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in eu-LISA has also been important for our connection to the update of Ireland&rsquo;s national Eurodac systems, as required by our participation in the Eurodac regulation.  The Oireachtas approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in both SIS II and Eurodac and we are now bound by our obligations under those regulations.  The support of eu-LISA is vital in meeting these obligations.  <\/p> <p>This regulation expanding eu-LISA&rsquo;s mandate will ensure that the agency is adapted to meet current challenges at EU level in the area of migration and security, and provide a proper legal basis for euLISA&rsquo;s operation and management of the planned new IT systems.  Before going into some detail about the new eu-LISA regulation, I merely wish to emphasise that participation in the eu-LISA agency does not mean that Ireland will be opting into any additional regulations in respect of any EU large-scale IT system.   Continued participation in eu-LISA would not oblige Ireland to participate in the new systems under its expanded mandate.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in such systems is a matter for the individual legal bases governing such IT systems.<\/p> <p>In particular, I want to acknowledge concerns of Deputies which were raised last night in the D&aacute;il on the proposed interoperability of EU large-scale IT systems.  It is true that eu-LISA will have a mandate to develop any technical features of interoperability which may arise as a result of proposals in this area.  However, I want to be very clear that it is not the case that Ireland will participate in measures relating to the interoperability of large-scale EU IT systems in the justice and home affairs area as a result of our opt-in to this eu-LISA regulation.  Ireland has the option under Article 4 of Protocol 21 to participate in the forthcoming interoperability regulations following their adoption.  These proposals have not yet been agreed at Union level so the decision to exercise our opt-in would require the consent of the Oireachtas under the justice and home affairs protocol.  There would be a debate on the merits of interoperability regulation at that point.  Therefore, I would ask that Deputies not by any manner of means conflate interoperability with this eu-LISA regulation which Ireland will participate in only in so far as it relates to the systems in which we already participate.  It would not be appropriate to have a debate on the interoperability proposals which have not yet been agreed at this time because no decision has been made as to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in it.  Ireland does not yet participate in all of the systems that is proposed to make interoperable, for example the ECRIS-TCN system.  For this reason I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General and I decided not to propose to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s opt-in under Article 3 of Protocol 21 when the interoperability proposals were published.  These proposals are somewhat complex and would require a dedicated discussion as to their merits but that is not the topic before us this morning.  The number of EU large-scale IT systems has grown and it is therefore important to place eu-LISA&rsquo;s responsibility for their operational management on a statutory footing.  In this regard this regulation achieves this goal in respect of the entry-exit system and the EU travel information and authorisation system.  Additionally, eu-LISA will now be enabled to provide more support and advice to member states.  The regulation places additional responsibility on eu-LISA for improving the quality of the data, establishing common data quality indicators and developing an anonymised central repository for reporting and statistics.  The regulation extends eu-LISA&rsquo;s mandate concerning research in particular, giving eu-LISA the task of implementing the parts of the framework programme for research and innovation which relate to IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.  <\/p> <p>It is proposed that more pilot projects may be entrusted to eu-LISA.  The new mandate of eu-LISA offers the possibility of support to the Commission and to member states in periods of exceptional need.  I believe, therefore, that it is essential that Ireland is an active partner in Europe&rsquo;s fight against terrorism in the effort to ensure effective management of our borders.  eu-Lisa is an essential agency that has demonstrated significant added value and whose expanded mandate effectively addresses gaps in the current systems.  We look forward to continuing to play an active role in the agency, bearing in mind our limited participation which focuses on the field of police cooperation.  I hope, therefore, that the committee will support the motion to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s opt in to the regulation and continue what has been a beneficial relationship within eu-LISA.    Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019041000002#D00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

Because we are not in Schengen most of it does not apply to us anyway.  I do accept that, including the most controversial aspects that we discussed last night, but that does not mean that we have not got an obligation to be critical of those or make points about them.  I do want to put them on the record because the interoperability proposals that this committee yellow-carded last October are at the back of this.  We sent a reasoned opinion to the Commission on its proposals for the interoperable border and security systems, which is nearly like an EU Stasi at this stage, whereby Big Brother is most definitely watching if one was not born inside the EU.  I will not repeat the points but the European Data Protection Commissioner has huge problems with it.  What we are doing today is extending the competencies of an existing body.  I get that.  We are extending it in such a way that it can implement the controversial interoperability proposals that we were unhappy about in October.  The concerns about linking migration and terrorism, which is at the heart of this, remain.  We need to have a serious discussion on that, why it is happening and how we should respond to it.  In the opinion on the interoperability proposals last autumn the European Data Protection Supervisor signalled his concerns about the implications and called for a wider debate.  That is the reason we asked for it to be discussed in the House, because there has not been any debate at all on this in the EU or in Ireland.  It is creating a mega interoperable database, which is a serious problem that I do not think the citizens of Europe have been consulted on, so we need to have these conversations.  I make no apologies that we demanded a discussion on it last night because nothing good can come of this linking of migration and terrorism.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to be clear in his response.  Are we effectively only opting in to the police co-operation aspects of SIS 2?  Is that it?  If we agree to these motions, are we signing up to any of the other aspects such as VIS, the border aspects of SIS II, EES and ETIAS or do we remain entirely outside of those?

It is important that data protection be upheld in respect of any further development of these systems.  Members will be aware that SIS II is supervised by the European Data Protection Supervisor.  The supervision is allocated to the data protection authorities in each member state, so any concerns that people might have about any perceived transgressions in respect of data protection can be can allayed on the basis that when Ireland connects to SIS II the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will be obliged to investigate any complaints that might be received.<\/p> <p>  I add to that the fact that we have already undergone Schengen evaluation in the area of data protection, so any concerns that Deputies might have can be addressed by assurances on the part of the Office of the Data Protection Commission here.  Ireland will not be participating in ETIAS or VIS and EES on the border aspects of SIS II.  The legal solution that we have agreed explicitly provides that we can participate in the regulation without having to opt in to the underlying Schengen acquis.  Ireland is not a party to either the visa aspects or the border aspects of the Schengen framework and that position will not in any way be affected or impacted upon by this regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019041000002#E00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Could the Minister be clear on the second question, that we are remaining entirely outside of VIS, the border aspects of SIS II, EES and ETIAS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019041000002#E00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019041000002#E00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The Minister was not quite clear in response to the first question.

When one looks at what is happening in the United Kingdom at present and the chaos they have got themselves into over Brexit, one of the real concerns they have, which has come home to roost, is that if they depart from the European Union without a deal, there will be issues in terms of the safety of that country, and that is the main reason why the Cabinet Secretary has given advice to the Cabinet there that they should not go out with no deal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019041000002#F00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned the development of IT systems and the sharing of information in the Schengen information system in the motion.

John Delaney has been appointed executive vice president.  This is in order to utilise his skills and connections at UEFA and FIFA levels effectively.

The board thanks her for stepping up to this role at short notice and at a difficult time.  There has been no full-time person appointed to Ms Walshe's former role as yet.  If I recall correctly, the committee had asked for that person to be present, but we have not made the appointment yet.<\/p><p> I wish to put on the record that no disrespect was intended to the committee or Sport Ireland by the FAI's letter of last week.  Sport Ireland has been and is an important stakeholder for us.  Its financial support and advice to us over 20 years have been unstinting and we were honoured to become the first national governing body to move onto the Abbotstown campus.  We have much to do to rebuild trust and confidence in the association and we are committed to achieving this as a board.<\/p><p> The association notes the comments made last week by the committee and Sport Ireland and acknowledges their concerns.  The board of the FAI met on Wednesday in a scheduled meeting.  The board regretted that it was not in a position to assist Sport Ireland with answers to its questions before Sport Ireland attended the committee.  We have since met Sport Ireland and continue to engage with it.  We have emphasised to it that we are moving as fast as we can, being mindful of the complexity of the issues involved, including legal issues and the need to ensure that all statements we make are accurate and our internal and external processes are fair and robust.  No disrespect was intended by the lateness of the letter of 2 April to Sport Ireland or its brief contents.  I apologise for this and accept that more information would have assisted Sport Ireland and the committee.<\/p><p> The board is seeking to address the concerns raised fully and many steps are being taken to do so and to establish the requisite detail for Sport Ireland and the committee.  The association has established a sub-committee from among its board members.  This is working closely with the FAI's external advisers and auditors to address these matters urgently.<\/p><p> Regarding governance, members will be aware that the FAI has a governance group, which has assisted us in making some changes in compliance with the governance code.  A number of policies and procedures were improved in 2018, including a code of conduct for board members, a schedule of reserved functions, a volunteers policy and a conflict of interest form.  New Government guidelines on terms for board members apply from 2021.

On 25 April 2017, an internal finance meeting was held by members of the finance team and the then chief executive officer.  At the meeting, the cash flow position of the association identified a possible cash flow issue at that time.  Acknowledging that the association's revenues operate in a cyclical fashion, this was an unusual situation and was not repeated in 2018.  The association's position on 25 April 2017 was that if all cheques issued in the week ending 28 April 2017 were cashed or presented to the bank at the same time, there was a likelihood of insufficient funds being available to cover all of them.  This was, however, a short-term issue as there was a legitimate expectation that funds would come to the association in the short term arising from various income streams including ticket sales, sponsorship, grant funding and other sources.  The CEO provided the association with a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 and thereby made funds available to provide some immediate financial relief and for the said funds to be used in a context where such additional funding was required by the association.  On Wednesday, 26 April 2017, a request was received by email from one particular creditor who was entitled to draw down funds from the association for just such a draw down.  The financial director contacted the chief executive officer via email, proposing to lodge the cheque for &euro;100,000 to the association's bank account to honour the draw-down request from the particular creditor.  The request was acknowledged by the chief executive officer and payment was made to the particular creditor.  The board acknowledged that the circumstances of the above &euro;100,000 transaction was exceptional and the repayment was subsequently made by the association on 16 June 2017 to the then chief executive officer.  No contract or agreement was entered into between the association and its then chief executive officer and no interest or charges have been levied or paid by the association in respect of the transaction.<\/p> <p>  Having been informed of the &euro;100,000 payment, the board acknowledged that disclosure would be made in the necessary financial statements in accordance with the required accounting treatment and the provisions of the Companies Act.  The association has since embarked on a review of its internal control processes and procedures to ensure a situation of this nature cannot arise again.

On 7 February 2019, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin, said the Government and Sport Ireland were satisfied with the new term limits for FAI board members.  We have also copied the committee with the report of Jonathan Hall Associates.

The board has also advised Sport Ireland that recent public comments by the FAI did not accurately reflect the board's level of awareness of the existence of the &euro;100,000 payment to the association in 2017.  That matter is being considered by the board's subcommittee, which was established in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>  I turn to address in order the questions posed by the committee to the board in recent correspondence.  The first question was on the process engaged in by the FAI to draw down State funding from Sport Ireland, including the annual certification process.  On an annual basis, the FAI submits a programme of action to Sport Ireland outlining our plans within the grassroots, player development, coach education and football services departments.  This sets out comprehensive programme plans, the key objectives and targets to be achieved and the expected timeline to achieve them.  Our programme of action also includes our annual budget for these programmes along with planned appointments for the year ahead.  The FAI also submits an end-of-year update on the previous year's programme of action which sets out the actual targets achieved and the actual income and expenditure for the previous year.  We also provide the following documentation, namely the terms and conditions of grant approval for the year ahead; an anti-doping compliance report; an update on participation figures; an update on FAInet, which is our registered players' database, and an update on our grassroots strategic pillars.  These reports are provided to Sport Ireland by the end of January each year.  Sport Ireland reviews our submissions and reverts with any queries which are dealt with in a timely manner.  The grant draw-down process is made by way of a letter from our financial director or CEO to the CEO of Sport Ireland.<\/p><p>Sport Ireland generally approves our field sport grant during the second quarter but it has the ability to release up to 50% of our annual grant before it formally approves the annual funding.  After its internal approval process, it will advance us a further 25%.  The final 25% is held until we provide an interim report on activities and budgets, our signed and approved financial statements, and an update on proceedings from our AGM in July or August.  Any queries, if applicable, are dealt with and once Sport Ireland is satisfied that the FAI has met all required criteria, the final balance of funding is processed.<\/p><p> The committee's second question was to request the entirety of the terms and conditions of grant approval including the manner in which the Football Association of Ireland ensures compliance with same.  I have brought a full copy of the Sport Ireland terms and conditions for grant approval for the committee.  I do not propose to read this into the record.  I refer to clause 4.3 of the further reporting section of our annual terms and conditions.  It requires the association to notify Sport Ireland in writing in the event of any material deterioration in its financial position.  We acknowledge that certain circumstances arose in April 2017 which were not reported to Sport Ireland.  We will work with Sport Ireland in order to establish a process to ensure the FAI is, in future, fully compliant with clause 4.3.  All other clauses within the terms and conditions are met.  We have also invited Sport Ireland to satisfy itself on this matter by meeting our colleagues.<\/p><p> The next question was on the process by which the financial statements of the Football Association of Ireland are compiled, including the sign-off mechanism, before production to Sport Ireland in accordance with the financial reporting obligation contained in the terms and conditions of grant approval.  The committee also asked for an explanation as to why particular credit facilities afforded to the Football Association of Ireland were not disclosed as part of this financial statement for the relevant year:<\/p><p> The FAI uses Sage 200 financial software to manage its financial transactions.  Management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and are reviewed by the finance director.  Actual versus budget reports are sent to all budget owners on a monthly basis for their review and action.  Monthly management accounts are presented to the finance committee and to the board.  On a quarterly basis, a full financial business review takes place between the CEO, the finance team and the relevant budget owners to discuss financial performance to date and any necessary action required.  At the year end, reports are exported from Sage 200 and mapped via Excel into financial statements.  A final review with the CEO takes place before the reports are presented to our auditors for independent review.  Our audit committee convenes at least twice during the auditing process.  Once this audit is completed, the financial statements are presented to the board for its approval and sign-off.  The signed financial statements are submitted to Sport Ireland for their review as per the terms and conditions of our annual grant.  We are currently looking at measures to review processes and to recommend controls to ensure full compliance with company law.<\/p><p> The committee asked for information on any audits carried out by Sport Ireland of the Football Association of Ireland, including the results of any such audit.  Sport Ireland audits tend to take place every three years.  There is an audit scheduled to take place this year and the last Sport Ireland audit took place in 2016.  <\/p><p> The committee also asked for information on the historical context to the drawdown of Sport Ireland funding including the timing of the drawdown, any requests for early drawdown and co-operation between Sport Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland in relation to such requests.<\/p><p> Sport Ireland has always supported the FAI and understands the cyclical nature of our funding.  Generally we would, with the agreement of Sport Ireland, draw down 50% of our annual field sports grant by the end of the first quarter, the next 25% would be released once Sport Ireland reviewed our annual January submissions and approved our annual grant internally, and the final instalment would be released once Sport Ireland satisfied itself that we had met all the required criteria.  This always takes place after our AGM in July or August each year.  Our programmes commence 1 January each year and a significant amount of our Sport Ireland funding contributes towards the cost of development officers and other grassroots administration roles.<\/p><p> The committee asked about the Football Association of Ireland&rsquo;s progress on the adoption of the code of practice for good governance for voluntary and charitable organisations, noting that the Government&rsquo;s national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies and national sports partnerships adopt the code by the end of 2021.  A governance committee was established in 2017 to ensure implementation of the code of practice for good governance in community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland and since its establishment has introduced the following: a board induction process, a code of conduct for board members, a conflict of interests form, a schedule of reserved functions for the board, a volunteer policy, and standing orders for board meetings.  In addition, term limits of eight years for all new board members have been introduced and three members of the board have been appointed to the FAI&rsquo;s audit committee.  The association intends to be fully compliant with the code by the end of 2021, within the deadline set out in the national sports policy.<\/p><p> The committee asked about communication between the Football Association of Ireland and Sport Ireland, including any statutory requests made by Sport Ireland seeking information from the Football Association of Ireland.  Each of our departments liaise with their counterparts in Sport Ireland.  We have developed very good working relationships with Sport Ireland and meet with it on a regular basis.  It seeks our assistance for various initiatives including organisational training, anti-doping measures, risk registers etc.  Statutory requests tend to come through either our legal or business partnerships departments, where they are dealt with as appropriate.  <\/p><p> We were also asked whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds in respect of certain programmes, and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain these programmes without State assistance.  State funding is of significant importance to FAI in delivering our grassroots programmes, in keeping with our overall policy of &ldquo;Football for All&rdquo;.  This, along with other funding sources through local authorities, has facilitated the growth of our nationwide development officer network.  We have a network of 57 development officers, with a further four in the process of recruitment.  The majority of development officer roles are co-funded.  This allows us to grow participation numbers nationally and to develop new participation programmes targeting our entire population.  The FAI would not have the capacity to maintain these programmes without the assistance of State funding.  Our 2019 programme of action budget shows the apportionment of our Sport Ireland grant relative to the actual cost of running these programmes.  The association matches each &euro;1 invested through Sport Ireland funding with an additional &euro;4, as acknowledged by Sport Ireland.<\/p><p> The business of sport is very different from others.  The qualification stage process of football is unique.  Financial fluctuations are the norm and cashflow is often irregular.  The disappointment of the failure of the men&rsquo;s senior team to qualify for World Cup 2018 had a major impact on match attendance and, subsequently, cashflow.  I know the committee wishes to question us about whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain programmes without State assistance.  I will not delay now, as I know members wish to raise queries on these issues, except to say we could not do what we do without State assistance.  Similarly, the activities of the FAI help to enable the State to meet some of its policy aims, especially in the areas of health and social inclusion.<\/p><p> I appreciate that Sport Ireland confirmed to the committee last week that its auditors were satisfied that all moneys granted to the FAI were expended in the manner for which they had been provided.  I want to make clear how seriously we take the issues that have emerged in recent weeks.  The sub-committee of the board has been working every day since its establishment on 26 March to plan a way forward, to ensure transparency, and to promote greater trust in our organisation.<\/p><p>Much work has been done in recent years to create a more financially sustainable organisation.  Cashflow management is at the forefront of our financial planning.  In time, a process will be put in train to appoint a new CEO, answerable to, but not a member of, the board in line with best governance practices.  We will use an outside independent body to assist in this search.  One of the main requirements for the next CEO will be to build on important relationships that already exist with Sport Ireland, the Oireachtas, this committee and all our stakeholders. <br\/><br\/>Members may be aware that our association commissioned Jonathan Hall Associates to engage in a review of senior executive roles.  The board had recognised that the workload of the CEO had expanded considerably over recent years and further expansion was likely, having regard to a number of potential strategic international projects under consideration.  Over the next three to four years, considerable demands will arise from the hosting of the Euro 2020 fixtures, the bids being assembled on a North-South basis for the 2023 under-21 men&rsquo;s European Championship finals, and the joint UK-Ireland bid for the 2030 World Cup.  It was the board&rsquo;s view that, coupled with the demands of managing a growing organisation, it was neither feasible nor best practice for the responsibility for addressing all these challenges to be placed on a single individual.  It was also the board&rsquo;s view that, in considering how roles might be structured, the association should have regard to models in place in other football associations and the unique influencing power and skills which are vested in the person of the former CEO by reference to his personal position as a member of the UEFA executive committee.  It was the Jonathan Hall Associates review which led to the creation of the position of executive vice-president. <br\/><br\/>Turning to the good work of the football family, while I acknowledge that members will be interested in questioning us about matters that have featured in the media in recent weeks, it is my duty to put on record the recent achievements of the Irish football family at every level.  These should not be lost in the heat of controversy.  I am sure that if I did not refer to these achievements, I would be criticised in many quarters, especially the football family.  Our national men&rsquo;s team, led by Mick McCarthy, has won its two opening matches in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA European Championship and sits on top of group D with six points.  As many members will be aware, Dublin will host four games at the Euro 2020 finals, with huge financial benefit for the economy.  If Ireland qualifies, we will be guaranteed two home games at the tournament.<br\/><br\/>Our national women&rsquo;s team, managed by Colin Bell, will begin its UEFA 2021 European Championship qualifying campaign against Montenegro in September, while our under-21 men&rsquo;s team, in Stephen Kenny's first match in charge, beat Luxembourg 3-0 on 24 March.  Tom Mohan&rsquo;s squad recently qualified for this summer&rsquo;s UEFA under-19 finals, as winners of its elite qualifying group.  Unlike other tournament finals, only eight of the 55 nations qualify for the under-19 tournament finals.  Next month, we will host the UEFA under-17 European Championship, with games to be played in counties Dublin, Wicklow, Waterford and Longford, where Colin O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s team will carry Irish hopes.  Our under-19 and under-17 women&rsquo;s teams have recently enjoyed victories over Serbia and Scotland, respectively, in their European Championship qualifiers.  Domestically, attendances have risen by more than 11% in the SSE Airtricity League of Ireland, with average increases of 13.5% and 42.9% in the premier division and first division, respectively.  At SSE Airtricity national league level, under-13 football was launched recently, which will complement the under-19, under-17, under-15 and under-13 levels and constitute part of our work with our high-performance director to design our new elite player pathway.  At grassroots level, the latest Irish Sports Monitor report by Sport Ireland confirms football as the sport with the greatest level of participation in the country.  Our recent implementation of the online FAInet process has registered 213,000 players in more than 86 leagues.  We continue to deliver our FAI strategic plan for 2016 to 2020 and we are in the fourth annual operations plan linked with the strategy, with positive outcomes in 2018 in respect of the targets set.  We are well on target towards full implementation by 2020. <br\/><br\/>The FAI also continues what I would describe as invaluable work in the following areas.  Our player development plan, under the auspices of high-performance director Ruud Dokter, is in its fourth year, with an emphasis on a player focused model, creating better players for the future.  Our emerging talent programme helps identify and develop talented young players from under-11 upwards throughout the country, with a view to helping them progress on to the international stage.  The regional emerging talent network has ten centres nationwide and ancillary centres in Dublin, with 1,200 players between boys and girls at three separate age groups.  In partnership with education and training boards, ETBs, nationwide, the FAI operates 11 local training initiatives that provide a unique blend of educational and football development for talented young footballers, both male and female.  The FAI-ETB player development programme enables participants to train full time while availing of a sport-themed education course, accredited at Quality and Qualifications Ireland level 5, which enables young players to achieve their academic and sporting potential.  Nine of our SSE Airtricity League of Ireland clubs have links with third level institutions.  The aim of our football for all programme is the delivery of football opportunities to people who may not ordinarily get a chance to play the beautiful game.  The programme comprises players from all groups and sporting bodies that cater for people with a disability who want to play football, and approximately 3,800 players participate.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, our football programme for the homeless and our late-night leagues, many of them in disadvantaged areas, continue to grow.  We launched the under-17 women&rsquo;s national league, with 11 clubs participating.  This is a further vital step to develop women&rsquo;s football at underage level.  Last year, we launched the glow football programme, which has the aim of encouraging young girls to become involved in football through a fun concept of playing indoor football to music in the dark under ultraviolet light.  Our FAI Aviva soccer sisters programme, now in its 13th year, will see girls between the ages of six and 14 attending football camps during the Easter holiday, bookings for which are already at record levels.  More than 42% of the 37,200 children taking part in thi<b>s <\/b>year's Spar primary school 5s programme are female, while 1,693 schools were involved.  More than 20,000 children from 1,038 schools took part in the 2018 primary and post-primary schools futsal programme, while more than 35,000 children participated in our Sports Direct summer soccer schools in a record 400 camps.  There were 2,245 participants in our school-club link programmes in 2018.  The FAI won the diversity and inclusion award at the 2018 Irish Sport Industry Awards organised by the Federation of Irish Sport.  In 2018, we rolled out the integration through football project and the sports welcomes refugees programme, both supported by the Department of Justice and Equality and the European Commission.  Four new development officers began work with the FAI during 2018 in Kilkenny and Dublin.  Two of the roles are solely dedicated to women&rsquo;s football, while one is for inclusion programmes. <br\/><br\/>These achievements and programmes can happen thanks only to the hard work and dedication of the players, the fans and our staff, and I pay credit to them all today.  I also apologise to them for the FAI currently being the subject of controversy and I hope a stronger and better association will emerge from our present difficulties.  This work could not take place without the vital funding we receive from the State.<\/p><p>I want to repeat how grateful the FAI is to receive these moneys via Sport Ireland.  They go towards programmes such as those I mentioned.<\/p><p> We appreciate also that receipt of State funding brings with it a heightened level of public and political scrutiny.  That is as it should be.  Nevertheless, the point should be made at this stage that FAI activities are primarily funded via UEFA and FIFA and through commercial and philanthropic sources, not to mention the various fundraising activities at local level in communities the length and breadth of Ireland.  This is not a one-way street, by which I mean football in Ireland, and our work in the FAI, brings with it not just huge social, health and community benefits, it also brings an economic benefit to the country and its economy.  Sport Ireland noted last week that for every euro it gives the FAI, the association spends four more.  This facilitates participation at grassroots level and enables us to reach out to all across the country who wish to play football and experience some of the excellent personal, health, community and societal benefits involved.<\/p><p> Despite our success on the pitch, and in communities around Ireland, the past few weeks have undoubtedly been a difficult time for Irish football and the FAI.  We are determined as a board, and I am determined as president, that our sole focus shall once again be to promote football in this country.  I hope the processes that we are putting in place in the short term, and the long-term processes around governance and reform, will help to restore the committee's faith in the FAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Before we break, can I get a copy of Mr. Delaney's intended statement?

I want to address the committee on the issue of &euro;100,000 I gave to the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, in April 2017, which was repaid to me in June 2017.<br\/><br\/>First of all I want to say how truly saddened I am that Sport Ireland, which provided annual State funding of &euro;2.9 million to the Football Association of Ireland, has announced that it has temporarily withdrawn the funding to the association pending reports from the FAI, Grant Thornton and Mazars.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make it clear that I have urged a speedy response to the queries received from Sport Ireland, and I this week I have already met with Grant Thornton and with the FAI on these issues.  I will respond to any request to a meeting as soon as I hear from Mazars.<br\/><br\/>On Tuesday, 25 April 2017 we had an internal finance meeting at the FAI.  This meeting was attended by our director of finance, Mr. Eamon Breen, our financial controller Ms Yvonne Tsang, and me as the CEO.  At this meeting I was advised that if all cheques and FAI bank transfers issued to third parties at that time were presented for payment that the FAI would exceed its overdraft limit of &euro;1.5 million on its bank accounts, which were held with Bank of Ireland.  I expressed concern and surprise at the meeting as to how the FAI could have arrived at this position.  I recall thinking at the time that if I had been approached even a few days earlier I may have been able to better address the issue.  I asked if any funds were due to the FAI that could resolve the matter and I was informed that there was nothing due imminently that could be confirmed at that stage.<br\/><br\/>As the matter was pressing and we only had a few hours to resolve the potential issues that would arise if the bank overdraft limit was exceeded, as a precautionary measure and to assist the FAI I wrote a cheque for &euro;100,000 from my personal account to the FAI.  This cheque was made payable to the FAI and I gave it to our director of finance, Eamon Breen, telling him to only lodge the cheque if it became clear that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.<br\/><br\/>Later that afternoon I travelled to London and the next day I travelled on to Geneva, Switzerland, where I was attending UEFA business on behalf of the FAI.  I recall phoning our honorary secretary, Mr. Michael Cody informing him that I had made a precautionary payment to the FAI by way of a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 to assist in the event that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.  I informed him that I was very concerned and that I had to act quickly to assist the Football Association of Ireland.  I recall also informing the then president Mr. Tony Fitzgerald who was chairman of the board at the time.<br\/><br\/>The following day while I was in Geneva I received a call from our director of finance, Eamon Breen, informing me that there was a requirement to lodge the cheque by &euro;100,000 and he subsequently confirmed that request to me by email.  I agreed that the cheque should be lodged.  I asked the director of finance when I would be paid back and he said it would be as soon as the funds came in.<br\/><br\/>I subsequently received a cheque for &euro;100,000 on 16 June 2017 from the Football Association of Ireland, repaying the amount in full and which I lodged to my personal account on 23 June 2017.  I did not receive any interest payment and I would never have expected it.  I was only acting to assist the FAI and for the benefit of Irish football.<br\/><br\/>I recall asking the director of finance, Eamon Breen, if the FAI had any reporting or disclosure obligations arising out of the &euro;100,000 payment.  There was a board meeting on Monday, 19 June 2017 and the &euro;100,000 payment did not arise.<br\/><br\/>On Monday, 4 March 2019 I informed the board of the FAI of the precautionary payment I had made, following a media query received from <i>The Sunday Times. <\/i>On Saturday, 16 March 2019 I initiated court proceedings against <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>at my own cost in relation to this matter because I believed at the time that this information had emanated from documentation that had been filed in the family courts.  I accept that the overdraft limit issue arose on my watch as the chief executive officer.  I wish that it had not happened but I acted in the best interests of the association.<br\/><br\/>We have an excellent and committed finance and administration team and body of employees at the FAI, and many voluntary workers and players at all levels throughout the country.  I regret the embarrassment this entire issue has caused to them and the association but I did it in the best interests of football.<br\/><br\/>I will continue to assist fully the Football Association of Ireland in its engagements with Sport Ireland and Grant Thornton.  When called upon to do so I will do likewise with Mazars and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in their respective inquiries.<br\/><br\/>On legal advice I am precluded from making any further comments at this hearing in relation to the finances of the association or my former role as CEO, or on the &euro;100,000 payment, either directly or indirectly.In the interests of fair procedures and natural justice I have made this statement to the committee and attended this meeting voluntarily, as I have attended many Oireachtas committees in the past.  I am not in a position to answer any such questions here at this time.  Given that some members of this committee have made highly prejudicial public pronouncements about me personally prior to my attendance here today, and in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Kerins case, I ask that the committee respects this position.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to answer any other questions in relation to my current role as executive vice president responsible for UEFA and FIFA matters.  As most members will know I am passionate about football and always have been.  In my role as executive vice-president I look forward to welcoming the European under-17 boys championships to Ireland next month.  This will see 16 teams play and provide at least 9,000 bed spaces for tourism for the country.  Next year Dublin is one of 12 European cities to host the Euro 2020.  This will see four matches played at the Aviva Stadium, hopefully including the Republic of Ireland team.  We are currently bidding for the 2023 under-21 men's tournament with the Irish Football Association.  This is a very significant project and demonstrates how the round ball can unify both associations on this island.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to see a Women's Champions League final being played in Dublin at the Aviva Stadium, perhaps to mark the 50th anniversary of the Women's Football Association in Ireland in 2023.<br\/><br\/>I, as an executive committee member of UEFA, along with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England, am currently working on a feasibility study that we hope will result in the 2030 FIFA World Cup being hosted across these islands.<br\/><br\/>From a financial perspective UEFA would provide the FAI with somewhere between &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million annually depending on participation in major tournaments.  It is a significant funder of the Football Association of Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>What was the taxpayer figure I had asked for earlier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554883200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Just before we broke the Chairman spoke about &euro;52 million in State funding - if that was the phrase - and the Chairman may have said FIFA-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>No.  I was talking about Sport Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R00700","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554883200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I understand that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The FAI has received &euro;52 million from there, as a matter of fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554883200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Can I just clarify something on those figures if possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Of course, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R01100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554883200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Over the 20 year span from 1999 to 2019 it is &euro;52.9 million.<\/p><p>It is very significant State funding and it is key to the delivery of our projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I did not catch the name of the financial controller, the third person at the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#S00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554883200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>It was Yvonne Tsang.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>We have agreed a rota of members to call on.

When I first read that the FAI was bringing Grant Thornton in to assist but also to investigate the &euro;100,000 loan I wondered why would a board bring in somebody else to investigate something the people in the room here know the answers to?<\/p><p>The same response was given today that Grant Thornton is investigating.  We also have the statement from John Delaney but the people here know the answers.  It appears that the two fingers are being given to Sport Ireland, this committee, the grassroots of the FAI and sports clubs.

A turnover of &euro;50 million is significant.  There is nothing illegal about an employee giving a loan to a company.  It is quite unusual but it can happen.  It is incredibly unusual that the board was not formally aware of it.  It is also incredibly unusual that it was not reported as a note to the accounts.  FRS 102 and the companies legislation require disclosures of related party transactions, which is significant particularly in the light of the clear audit opinion the association received, as I understand.

Mr. Conway mentioned that monthly cash flows, projections, variance analyses and so on are reported to the board by the financial controller.  I find it difficult to understand the figure of &euro;100,000 given that the FAI had a turnover of &euro;50 million and &euro;22.3 million in net total assets, with a profit of &euro;2.7 million in the year in question.  Could the FAI not have held off &euro;100,000 worth of creditors for a little while?  As Deputy O'Keeffe suggested, could it not have reverted to the bank to ask for another &euro;100,000 as a short-term facility?  There is a significant disjoint in that regard.

Mr. Delaney is the executive vice president of the FAI with responsibility for FIFA and UEFA matters.  FIFA certainly has not been the most open group.  Sepp Blatter was the general secretary since 1981 and president since 1998.  He has been suspended since 2015 for corruption and financial mismanagement and he has been ejected from office for eight years.  How different has the FAI been from FIFA in the past few years?

The current FIFA president is Gianni Infantino.  FIFA has changed remarkably in his period there.  This is well accepted.  I work closely with the UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin, and he has brought UEFA forward incredibly well over the past number of years.  They are two parent bodies of the FAI.  UEFA is a significant funder of the FAI and FIFA's revenues are increasing with the association.  I could not speak higher of how UEFA is run under the stewardship of its current president.  There is no doubt that FIFA has come a remarkable distance.  The recent vote for the World Cup was transparent and open.  When the \"United\" bid won, it was put up on the screens.  I could not but commend both organisations on how they are run.  There are key funding negotiations to come into the future with regard to our centralised television deals.  I also hope that UEFA will run a television channel on social media for domestic leagues where the League of Ireland could well get a global audience.  This is very important to the association and to me coming from a League of Ireland background.  We work very closely with both bodies the Senator has mentioned.  They are significant funders but they are also a significant resource support to the FAI.  They are two very well run organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#AA02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Every time one hears of the FAI there is another report coming be it Jonathan Hall Associates, Mazars or Grant Thornton.

I will not go into them in great detail but I would like to get clarity on some of them.  On the issue of John Delaney's appointment to his new role, I do not know Mr. Delaney very well but I know that as an ambassador for Ireland and Irish sports he has done an amazing job and I am sure he will do an amazing job in this regard.  He has worked on anti-racism and integration.  I have been involved in the Oireachtas soccer teams that have taken part in games in this regard.  It is important to highlight issues such as these and sport is a great way of doing so.  Mr. Delaney has taken on board certain initiatives and has been very successful in doing so.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe, asked a technical but important question.  Am I correct that the &euro;100,000 cheque was made out to a particular person?  Is that correct?  Was there a concern about a number of cheques?  What is the overall figure of all the cheques?  We have all been in a situation where we have written cheques whereby if they were all lodged in the same week, we would not have had enough money to meet them.  Was it one particular cheque that the FAI thought would be the one to tip it over with regard to what was in its account?  Deputy O'Keeffe made a very interesting point.  If I were in that position, I would not write a cheque but do a cash transfer because by the time my cheque arrived in the account, it might not be cleared.  Then the cheque on the other side would be processed and also might not be cleared.  I am concerned about the logistics.  The first thing I would do if the &euro;100,000 would tip me over the edge would be to ask the recipient to hold off until the following Monday as I would be okay by then.  Deputy O'Keeffe made a very interesting point on this.  He stated one would not write cheques but would make cash transfers from one bank account to another so it would be immediate.  One would then not be worried about whether a cheque was lodged.  More importantly, in the normal course of events - perhaps this is why it would be helpful to have the report in full - one would just ring up the guys and ask them not to cash the cheque this week and tell them it would be okay for the following week.  I am sure that would not have caused anyone any undue stress.  This is a very technical point.  Other than that, all of my other questions have already been asked.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms Walsh, the interim chief executive officer, whom I wish the best success.  I suggest that a percentage of the new board be from both genders, whatever that may be.  One of the criticisms I have of the FAI is its treatment of women.  The women's national team and underage structure should receive equal treatment.  That is my point.  They should get the same amount of resources.  Clearly, they do not, the reason being they do not bring in revenue, and we understand that.  However, look at what Croke Park manages to do with regard to ladies' football on the one day of the year it is the biggest sporting event for women.  Equal treatment is required.  In fairness, the GAA has come a long way but it has not come all the way.  We cannot have the national ladies' football team handing over tracksuits in an airport.  I hope that the issue of gender equality on the board will be part of governance, and bear in mind women make up 50% of the population.  They would give a different viewpoint.  Perhaps in some instances, when everybody else is going off and doing something, having more women on the main board and all of the governance committees and making this a policy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#BB00500","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Does that apply to Fianna F&aacute;il as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#BB00600","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>We have loads of women throughout our organisation, including spokespersons.  Deputy Lisa Chambers is doing an excellent job on Brexit.  I am sure if she were in Westminster, she would have sorted it out a long time ago, as would all of the women.<\/p> <p>  As part of the governance review, the FAI should make sure the women's soccer team and all of the women who will, I hope, account for half of participants in soccer in future are represented.  By the way, the reason this issue will not be raised by Grant Thornton and all of the others is that it is men who will write the reports and they have a bias.  They keep forgetting they should be doing this.  Perhaps out of this the FAI should make a commitment to ensure equal treatment for the ladies' football team and give a commitment to have a substantial percentage of women within its governance structure.  I would say the figure should be 50% because women make up half of the population and half of the funding the FAI receives from the Government is supplied by women because they pay tax too.  They are entitled to have representation across the board of every sporting organisation but as the FAI is here today, I make the request of it.

I have read out various figures today.  Equality is the issue and it is not the issue in this sense.  In my address, I spoke about the SPAR primary school fives.  Of all of our programmes, it has the highest female participation, as 42% or 43% of the 37,000 participants are female.  Senator Daly rightly stressed the importance of equality.  Our challenge, which is the challenge of every sport, is that at the ages of 13, 14, 17 and 18, in excess of 40% of participants will still be female.  It is fantastic to see it in the primary school fives, which involves fourth, fifth and sixth classes in primary schools throughout the country getting their day out in the Aviva Stadium.  It is a brilliant day when they come up.  It is not graded.  Schools play based on enrolment figures so it is not the case that a big school will get there ahead of a small school.  The competitions are based on enrolment.  I have mentioned the 43% female participation and the challenge for us is to try to keep this percentage the whole way up, including at board level and having female coaches, referees and administrators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#BB00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#BB01000","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I want to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#BB01100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I did not use the full ten minutes.

The one thing which is of great concern to all of us is the temporary withdrawal of funding to the association pending the three reports from the FAI, Grant Thornton and Mazars.  All I would say about that matters is that any person who has ever been involved in any type of business, regardless of whether it is trading with &euro;50 million or &euro;50,000 a year, has dealt with different problems at various times.  If we looked back on the way that we dealt with those problems maybe we would not have dealt with them in the smartest of ways.  Hindsight is of great benefit to all of us.  I have no doubt that if Mr. Delaney had his time back, perhaps this whole issue would have been dealt with a different way.  However, I am quite confident that the only thing Mr. Delaney could be accused of is being passionately committed to his job and to the survival of what I would call the business and that all he was trying to do was good.  Of course, there has to be proper governance, there have to be proper accountancy practices but I really cannot for the life of me see how the three reports will not be positive in their findings, thereby allowing for the funding to be restored.  The president was questioned about Mr. Delaney's suitability to be the executive vice president of the association.  Mr. Delaney's work ethic over the years will show that he is eminently qualified and most definitely the best-qualified person for this new role that has been created for continuity and for dealing with FIFA and UEFA.<\/p> <p>  It would be very remiss of me not to mention what I know first hand, particularly as we are hearing a lot of other stuff today.

There are many full-time clubs in the Premier Division.<\/p> <p>  As our president mentioned, we have introduced underage national leagues.  These are for players under 19, under 17, under 15 and under 13, and they have been very positive not only for the players, as there is an elite player pathway, but the communities the clubs are in.  More people are feeling an affiliation to a club at all levels.  Going to matches, there are visibly more families and children, with bigger attendances and great football being played.  The work done by clubs and people at the coalface in this area is tremendous and they really have come on leaps and bounds over the past few years.  It is really difficult to run a League of Ireland club but the majority of clubs have excelled.  We can see the proof today on a Friday night or a Saturday in Sligo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#OOO00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fran Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>I must go again to a vote.

By way of example, the committee previously held meetings in regard to the coastguard.  Under freedom of information, we requested the original draft of a report and compared it with the one presented to a Minister.  Everything that was harmful to the people before the committee had been removed from the latter version.  We are talking about establishing credibility and confidence.  I am concerned by this matter raised by another member.  Is the association prepared to provide the committee with the original draft report by Jonathan Hall Associates?<\/p> <p>  Did the other 12 available accounts cumulatively contain &euro;100,000?  The FAI seems to have been anticipating a bill of &euro;100,000.  The bill was expected.  For how long did the association know the &euro;100,000 was hanging over it and that it did not have the money to meet the debt?  What was the bill for?  I know the witnesses will not tell us to whom it was payable.  Did it relate to infrastructure?  Was it money due to a club?  Was it to pay staff wages or expenses?  A bill of &euro;100,000 is not an everyday occurrence.  The association knew for a long time that it was coming, but it did not seem to have &euro;100,000 in the other 12 accounts, seek an overdraft or ring anybody to ask that the bill payment be delayed.  It seems to have been an outstanding bill.  For how long was it outstanding?  For how long did the association know it was coming?  How long did it have to pay the bill?<\/p> <p>  The statement made earlier outlined that Grant Thornton had sight of this.  I am not an accountant, but the phraseology used would not be used by accountants.  It stated that all cheques issued in the week 28 April 2017 were cashed and presented at the time.  It is not just cheques - much of the money dispersed by the FAI would be sent via bank transfer and so on.  I do not understand how Grant Thornton would have signed off on that.  If this matter was coming to the committee this morning and it had sight of it, it would have pointed out that it is not the phraseology it would have used because in the modern world such firms do not say, \"We draw down cheques\" or \"cheques presented\".  My concern is that the FAI had a significant amount of money in other accounts but it does not appear to have added up to &euro;100,000 or was earmarked for other commitments.  For how long was the &euro;100,000 owed?  How long did the FAI have to pay it?  For what was the bill?  Was it related to infrastructure or a bill from a contractor or club or money due to a competition?  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien alluded to that issue.

We have asked many technical questions.  Some answers have been given and some cannot be given.  We are unhappy in certain ways.<\/p> <p>  I will come at this matter from a different angle.  Last week, Mr. John Treacy was asked to answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" on the question of whether he had confidence in the FAI board.  He said he would not say \"Yes\".  It was not a good day last week.  He also said that, over the past decade, the FAI has been audited by Sport Ireland's independent auditors on more occasions than any sporting organisation.  Independent audits of the FAI were completed on Sport Ireland's behalf in 2010, 2014 and 2016, with all the findings reported to Sport Ireland's audit and risk committee.  I know the FAI is a very large organisation that gets huge money but why has the FAI been audited on more occasions than any other sporting organisations?  Is there a reason for it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#QQQ03500","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554883200,"counter":1258,"content":"<p>I am not sure what the regularity of audit is for the other major field sports, for example, or for other sports in general.

We have made it clear today that we seek the first tranche of money early each year.  Programmes are in place.  It is difficult for me to answer the question of why Sport Ireland would do that.  We may have supplied the audits and the outcome of those audits do not trigger any significant concern on the part of Sport Ireland.

I went to my first Republic of Ireland game over 40 years ago.  I ran a double-decker bus to Germany in 1988.  I am a member of the soccer fraternity.  I have served as secretary of my local soccer club and I was treasurer of the Roscommon district league 30 years ago.  I welcomed the recommendations of the Genesis report because, at the time, the FAI was not fit for purpose.  The association has made huge inroads in the past number of years, notwithstanding the selling of Glenmalure Park in the 1980s.  I will not get into that now but it caused major damage to the FAI among the general public.  That is another day's work.  We can consider the &euro;100,000 loan and the hasty restructuring of the top level of management in the FAI.  At least it looks hasty.  We can also consider the financial health of the organisation while FAI staff take pay cuts.  Sport Ireland has suspended funding, which is bad news.<\/p> <p>  When the Republic of Ireland team is going well, everybody asks why we do not have an all-island soccer team and people say it would be great.  If I were involved with the Irish Football Association, IFA, which oversees the Northern Ireland soccer team, I would be asking if it would really want to join forces with the FAI, particularly in view of all the bad news that is coming out.  I am smiling to myself because what happened in 2016 was wonderful.  Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland supporters were together on the streets in Paris and around France.  We have come a long way in the past 20 years.  It may be tongue-in-cheek but we have all-island hockey and rugby teams.  In 1924, there was an all-island soccer team that was headquartered in Belfast.  Maybe after today we should look for the establishment of an all-island soccer team.  Perhaps the FAI should move in with the IFA instead of the other way around.  The all-island soccer team could play in Belfast.  This matter has been very damaging to the idea of having an all-island soccer team.  I hope we can come out of this in a much better way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000002#QQQ03900","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1554883200,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>I need to ask a few questions.

I have their names listed here.  I will say their names because it is important to me.  Nicky Colgan, Gary Kelly and Ian Harte were all reared by Dave and people like him.  Right around the country, all those young people who succeed locally, regionally and nationally are driven by people like Dave.  The point I am making relates to the point I made earlier, that is, that the corporate governance in Mr. Conway's organisation is totally inadequate, and that is why it is not getting the funding.  The regime change I am talking about is what people need.  They need it, and need it now.  If they do not get it, the association will be in a serious crisis.  I am concerned because the sponsors and public are looking at this.  There is a lot of uncertainty.  To ensure certainty, the best thing the board members could do is move on.  If they did so and new people came in, the association could turn around.  Consider how the Olympic Council of Ireland changed.  I am aware that individuals will make sacrifices if they make a decision to move on but it is needed.  That is the impression I am getting from everybody.  We have to talk to the rest of the people.  I appreciate there is not much time left.  The picture in my mind is of all the young people going out to play this evening and on Saturday.  Their parents accompany them, drive them, buy them football boots and go through the tough life of a parent looking after young children.  That is the message I have to give the delegates from the people who talk to me.  I appreciate their listening to me.<\/p> <p>  There are 15 minutes left.  I want to make another couple of points.  I acknowledge there are others who wish to contribute but I am doing my very best.  We have been here for nine hours and the delegates have been here for eight.
