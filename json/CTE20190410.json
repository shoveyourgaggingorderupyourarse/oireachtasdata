We need to be mindful of our legal obligations and the remit of the committee and to respect the privacy and data protection rights of our employees and related parties.<\/p> <p> Grant Thornton has been engaged by the board of the FAI to conduct an internal review of the association's books, records and ledgers.  It has been on site at the FAI since yesterday week.  I will reference it further in my statement.<\/p> <p> The committee also asked for the attendance of the person filling the position of corporate affairs and licensing director.  John Delaney has been appointed executive vice president.  This is in order to utilise his skills and connections at UEFA and FIFA levels effectively.  In the view of the board, this will be to the benefit of Irish football.  In his place, Rea Walshe has been appointed interim chief executive officer.  The board thanks her for stepping up to this role at short notice and at a difficult time.  There has been no full-time person appointed to Ms Walshe's former role as yet.  If I recall correctly, the committee had asked for that person to be present, but we have not made the appointment yet.<\/p> <p> I wish to put on the record that no disrespect was intended to the committee or Sport Ireland by the FAI's letter of last week.  Sport Ireland has been and is an important stakeholder for us.  Its financial support and advice to us over 20 years have been unstinting and we were honoured to become the first national governing body to move onto the Abbotstown campus.  We have much to do to rebuild trust and confidence in the association and we are committed to achieving this as a board.<\/p> <p> The association notes the comments made last week by the committee and Sport Ireland and acknowledges their concerns.  The board of the FAI met on Wednesday in a scheduled meeting.  The board regretted that it was not in a position to assist Sport Ireland with answers to its questions before Sport Ireland attended the committee.  We have since met Sport Ireland and continue to engage with it.  We have emphasised to it that we are moving as fast as we can, being mindful of the complexity of the issues involved, including legal issues and the need to ensure that all statements we make are accurate and our internal and external processes are fair and robust.  No disrespect was intended by the lateness of the letter of 2 April to Sport Ireland or its brief contents.  I apologise for this and accept that more information would have assisted Sport Ireland and the committee.<\/p> <p> The board is seeking to address the concerns raised fully and many steps are being taken to do so and to establish the requisite detail for Sport Ireland and the committee.  The association has established a sub-committee from among its board members.  This is working closely with the FAI's external advisers and auditors to address these matters urgently.<\/p> <p> Regarding governance, members will be aware that the FAI has a governance group, which has assisted us in making some changes in compliance with the governance code.  A number of policies and procedures were improved in 2018, including a code of conduct for board members, a schedule of reserved functions, a volunteers policy and a conflict of interest form.  New Government guidelines on terms for board members apply from 2021.  The association held an EGM this year where it voted to limit board members to eight years' service in line with the Government's governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations.

On 25 April 2017, an internal finance meeting was held by members of the finance team and the then chief executive officer.  At the meeting, the cash flow position of the association identified a possible cash flow issue at that time.  Acknowledging that the association's revenues operate in a cyclical fashion, this was an unusual situation and was not repeated in 2018.  The association's position on 25 April 2017 was that if all cheques issued in the week ending 28 April 2017 were cashed or presented to the bank at the same time, there was a likelihood of insufficient funds being available to cover all of them.  This was, however, a short-term issue as there was a legitimate expectation that funds would come to the association in the short term arising from various income streams including ticket sales, sponsorship, grant funding and other sources.  The CEO provided the association with a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 and thereby made funds available to provide some immediate financial relief and for the said funds to be used in a context where such additional funding was required by the association.  On Wednesday, 26 April 2017, a request was received by email from one particular creditor who was entitled to draw down funds from the association for just such a draw down.  The financial director contacted the chief executive officer via email, proposing to lodge the cheque for &euro;100,000 to the association's bank account to honour the draw-down request from the particular creditor.  The request was acknowledged by the chief executive officer and payment was made to the particular creditor.  The board acknowledged that the circumstances of the above &euro;100,000 transaction was exceptional and the repayment was subsequently made by the association on 16 June 2017 to the then chief executive officer.  No contract or agreement was entered into between the association and its then chief executive officer and no interest or charges have been levied or paid by the association in respect of the transaction.<\/p>  <p>  Having been informed of the &euro;100,000 payment, the board acknowledged that disclosure would be made in the necessary financial statements in accordance with the required accounting treatment and the provisions of the Companies Act.  The association has since embarked on a review of its internal control processes and procedures to ensure a situation of this nature cannot arise again.  Mr. Delaney will also address this issue in his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000006#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554884400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>On a point of information, do we have that opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000006#J00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554884400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>If the committee wants a copy, we can circulate it after Mr. Conway finishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000006#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1554884400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I want to be fair to everybody.

The association recognises and shares the desire for these matters to be addressed as soon as possible and with due regard to the different ongoing processes and legal requirements.  The FAI is also engaging with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in dealing with its inquiries.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to governance.  The committee will be aware that the FAI has a governance group which has assisted us to make some changes in compliance with the governance code.  A number of policies and procedures were approved in 2018, including a code of conduct for board members, a schedule of reserved functions, a volunteering policy and a conflict of interest form.  New governance guidelines on term limits for board members will apply from 2021.  This year, the association held an EGM at which it voted to limit board members to eight years' service which is in line with the governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  On 7 February 2019, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin, said the Government and Sport Ireland were satisfied with the new term limits for FAI board members.  We have also copied the committee with the report of Jonathan Hall Associates.  The board plans to undertake a root and branch review of the FAI and to strengthen our commitment to reform through the establishment of a new group to review and recommend changes in governance to the association.  We have indicated to Sport Ireland that we will seek its input on the composition of the group.  I am aware the committee wishes to question us on the adoption of the code and will not pre-empt that.  The board has also advised Sport Ireland that recent public comments by the FAI did not accurately reflect the board's level of awareness of the existence of the &euro;100,000 payment to the association in 2017.  That matter is being considered by the board's subcommittee, which was established in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to address in order the questions posed by the committee to the board in recent correspondence.  The first question was on the process engaged in by the FAI to draw down State funding from Sport Ireland, including the annual certification process.  On an annual basis, the FAI submits a programme of action to Sport Ireland outlining our plans within the grassroots, player development, coach education and football services departments.  This sets out comprehensive programme plans, the key objectives and targets to be achieved and the expected timeline to achieve them.  Our programme of action also includes our annual budget for these programmes along with planned appointments for the year ahead.  The FAI also submits an end-of-year update on the previous year's programme of action which sets out the actual targets achieved and the actual income and expenditure for the previous year.  We also provide the following documentation, namely the terms and conditions of grant approval for the year ahead; an anti-doping compliance report; an update on participation figures; an update on FAInet, which is our registered players' database, and an update on our grassroots strategic pillars.  These reports are provided to Sport Ireland by the end of January each year.  Sport Ireland reviews our submissions and reverts with any queries which are dealt with in a timely manner.  The grant draw-down process is made by way of a letter from our financial director or CEO to the CEO of Sport Ireland. <\/p> <p>Sport Ireland generally approves our field sport grant during the second quarter but it has the ability to release up to 50% of our annual grant before it formally approves the annual funding.  After its internal approval process, it will advance us a further 25%.  The final 25% is held until we provide an interim report on activities and budgets, our signed and approved financial statements, and an update on proceedings from our AGM in July or August.  Any queries, if applicable, are dealt with and once Sport Ireland is satisfied that the FAI has met all required criteria, the final balance of funding is processed.<\/p> <p> The committee's second question was to request the entirety of the terms and conditions of grant approval including the manner in which the Football Association of Ireland ensures compliance with same.  I have brought a full copy of the Sport Ireland terms and conditions for grant approval for the committee.  I do not propose to read this into the record.  I refer to clause 4.3 of the further reporting section of our annual terms and conditions.  It requires the association to notify Sport Ireland in writing in the event of any material deterioration in its financial position.  We acknowledge that certain circumstances arose in April 2017 which were not reported to Sport Ireland.  We will work with Sport Ireland in order to establish a process to ensure the FAI is, in future, fully compliant with clause 4.3.  All other clauses within the terms and conditions are met.  We have also invited Sport Ireland to satisfy itself on this matter by meeting our colleagues.<\/p> <p> The next question was on the process by which the financial statements of the Football Association of Ireland are compiled, including the sign-off mechanism, before production to Sport Ireland in accordance with the financial reporting obligation contained in the terms and conditions of grant approval.  The committee also asked for an explanation as to why particular credit facilities afforded to the Football Association of Ireland were not disclosed as part of this financial statement for the relevant year:<\/p> <p> The FAI uses Sage 200 financial software to manage its financial transactions.  Management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and are reviewed by the finance director.  Actual versus budget reports are sent to all budget owners on a monthly basis for their review and action.  Monthly management accounts are presented to the finance committee and to the board.  On a quarterly basis, a full financial business review takes place between the CEO, the finance team and the relevant budget owners to discuss financial performance to date and any necessary action required.  At the year end, reports are exported from Sage 200 and mapped via Excel into financial statements.  A final review with the CEO takes place before the reports are presented to our auditors for independent review.  Our audit committee convenes at least twice during the auditing process.  Once this audit is completed, the financial statements are presented to the board for its approval and sign-off.  The signed financial statements are submitted to Sport Ireland for their review as per the terms and conditions of our annual grant.  We are currently looking at measures to review processes and to recommend controls to ensure full compliance with company law.<\/p> <p> The committee asked for information on any audits carried out by Sport Ireland of the Football Association of Ireland, including the results of any such audit.  Sport Ireland audits tend to take place every three years.  There is an audit scheduled to take place this year and the last Sport Ireland audit took place in 2016.  <\/p> <p> The committee also asked for information on the historical context to the drawdown of Sport Ireland funding including the timing of the drawdown, any requests for early drawdown and co-operation between Sport Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland in relation to such requests.<\/p> <p> Sport Ireland has always supported the FAI and understands the cyclical nature of our funding.  Generally we would, with the agreement of Sport Ireland, draw down 50% of our annual field sports grant by the end of the first quarter, the next 25% would be released once Sport Ireland reviewed our annual January submissions and approved our annual grant internally, and the final instalment would be released once Sport Ireland satisfied itself that we had met all the required criteria.  This always takes place after our AGM in July or August each year.  Our programmes commence 1 January each year and a significant amount of our Sport Ireland funding contributes towards the cost of development officers and other grassroots administration roles.<\/p> <p> The committee asked about the Football Association of Ireland&rsquo;s progress on the adoption of the code of practice for good governance for voluntary and charitable organisations, noting that the Government&rsquo;s national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies and national sports partnerships adopt the code by the end of 2021.  A governance committee was established in 2017 to ensure implementation of the code of practice for good governance in community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland and since its establishment has introduced the following: a board induction process, a code of conduct for board members, a conflict of interests form, a schedule of reserved functions for the board, a volunteer policy, and standing orders for board meetings.  In addition, term limits of eight years for all new board members have been introduced and three members of the board have been appointed to the FAI&rsquo;s audit committee.  The association intends to be fully compliant with the code by the end of 2021, within the deadline set out in the national sports policy.<\/p> <p> The committee asked about communication between the Football Association of Ireland and Sport Ireland, including any statutory requests made by Sport Ireland seeking information from the Football Association of Ireland.  Each of our departments liaise with their counterparts in Sport Ireland.  We have developed very good working relationships with Sport Ireland and meet with it on a regular basis.  It seeks our assistance for various initiatives including organisational training, anti-doping measures, risk registers etc.  Statutory requests tend to come through either our legal or business partnerships departments, where they are dealt with as appropriate.  <\/p> <p> We were also asked whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds in respect of certain programmes, and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain these programmes without State assistance.  State funding is of significant importance to FAI in delivering our grassroots programmes, in keeping with our overall policy of &ldquo;Football for All&rdquo;.  This, along with other funding sources through local authorities, has facilitated the growth of our nationwide development officer network.  We have a network of 57 development officers, with a further four in the process of recruitment.  The majority of development officer roles are co-funded.  This allows us to grow participation numbers nationally and to develop new participation programmes targeting our entire population.  The FAI would not have the capacity to maintain these programmes without the assistance of State funding.  Our 2019 programme of action budget shows the apportionment of our Sport Ireland grant relative to the actual cost of running these programmes.  The association matches each &euro;1 invested through Sport Ireland funding with an additional &euro;4, as acknowledged by Sport Ireland.<\/p> <p> The business of sport is very different from others.  The qualification stage process of football is unique.  Financial fluctuations are the norm and cashflow is often irregular.  The disappointment of the failure of the men&rsquo;s senior team to qualify for World Cup 2018 had a major impact on match attendance and, subsequently, cashflow.  I know the committee wishes to question us about whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain programmes without State assistance.  I will not delay now, as I know members wish to raise queries on these issues, except to say we could not do what we do without State assistance.  Similarly, the activities of the FAI help to enable the State to meet some of its policy aims, especially in the areas of health and social inclusion.<\/p> <p> I appreciate that Sport Ireland confirmed to the committee last week that its auditors were satisfied that all moneys granted to the FAI were expended in the manner for which they had been provided.  I want to make clear how seriously we take the issues that have emerged in recent weeks.  The sub-committee of the board has been working every day since its establishment on 26 March to plan a way forward, to ensure transparency, and to promote greater trust in our organisation.<\/p> <p>Much work has been done in recent years to create a more financially sustainable organisation.  Cashflow management is at the forefront of our financial planning.  In time, a process will be put in train to appoint a new CEO, answerable to, but not a member of, the board in line with best governance practices.  We will use an outside independent body to assist in this search.  One of the main requirements for the next CEO will be to build on important relationships that already exist with Sport Ireland, the Oireachtas, this committee and all our stakeholders. <br\/><br\/>Members may be aware that our association commissioned Jonathan Hall Associates to engage in a review of senior executive roles.  The board had recognised that the workload of the CEO had expanded considerably over recent years and further expansion was likely, having regard to a number of potential strategic international projects under consideration.  Over the next three to four years, considerable demands will arise from the hosting of the Euro 2020 fixtures, the bids being assembled on a North-South basis for the 2023 under-21 men&rsquo;s European Championship finals, and the joint UK-Ireland bid for the 2030 World Cup.  It was the board&rsquo;s view that, coupled with the demands of managing a growing organisation, it was neither feasible nor best practice for the responsibility for addressing all these challenges to be placed on a single individual.  It was also the board&rsquo;s view that, in considering how roles might be structured, the association should have regard to models in place in other football associations and the unique influencing power and skills which are vested in the person of the former CEO by reference to his personal position as a member of the UEFA executive committee.  It was the Jonathan Hall Associates review which led to the creation of the position of executive vice-president. <br\/><br\/>Turning to the good work of the football family, while I acknowledge that members will be interested in questioning us about matters that have featured in the media in recent weeks, it is my duty to put on record the recent achievements of the Irish football family at every level.  These should not be lost in the heat of controversy.  I am sure that if I did not refer to these achievements, I would be criticised in many quarters, especially the football family.  Our national men&rsquo;s team, led by Mick McCarthy, has won its two opening matches in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA European Championship and sits on top of group D with six points.  As many members will be aware, Dublin will host four games at the Euro 2020 finals, with huge financial benefit for the economy.  If Ireland qualifies, we will be guaranteed two home games at the tournament.<br\/><br\/>Our national women&rsquo;s team, managed by Colin Bell, will begin its UEFA 2021 European Championship qualifying campaign against Montenegro in September, while our under-21 men&rsquo;s team, in Stephen Kenny's first match in charge, beat Luxembourg 3-0 on 24 March.  Tom Mohan&rsquo;s squad recently qualified for this summer&rsquo;s UEFA under-19 finals, as winners of its elite qualifying group.  Unlike other tournament finals, only eight of the 55 nations qualify for the under-19 tournament finals.  Next month, we will host the UEFA under-17 European Championship, with games to be played in counties Dublin, Wicklow, Waterford and Longford, where Colin O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s team will carry Irish hopes.  Our under-19 and under-17 women&rsquo;s teams have recently enjoyed victories over Serbia and Scotland, respectively, in their European Championship qualifiers.  Domestically, attendances have risen by more than 11% in the SSE Airtricity League of Ireland, with average increases of 13.5% and 42.9% in the premier division and first division, respectively.  At SSE Airtricity national league level, under-13 football was launched recently, which will complement the under-19, under-17, under-15 and under-13 levels and constitute part of our work with our high-performance director to design our new elite player pathway.  At grassroots level, the latest Irish Sports Monitor report by Sport Ireland confirms football as the sport with the greatest level of participation in the country.  Our recent implementation of the online FAInet process has registered 213,000 players in more than 86 leagues.  We continue to deliver our FAI strategic plan for 2016 to 2020 and we are in the fourth annual operations plan linked with the strategy, with positive outcomes in 2018 in respect of the targets set.  We are well on target towards full implementation by 2020. <br\/><br\/>The FAI also continues what I would describe as invaluable work in the following areas.  Our player development plan, under the auspices of high-performance director Ruud Dokter, is in its fourth year, with an emphasis on a player focused model, creating better players for the future.  Our emerging talent programme helps identify and develop talented young players from under-11 upwards throughout the country, with a view to helping them progress on to the international stage.  The regional emerging talent network has ten centres nationwide and ancillary centres in Dublin, with 1,200 players between boys and girls at three separate age groups.  In partnership with education and training boards, ETBs, nationwide, the FAI operates 11 local training initiatives that provide a unique blend of educational and football development for talented young footballers, both male and female.  The FAI-ETB player development programme enables participants to train full time while availing of a sport-themed education course, accredited at Quality and Qualifications Ireland level 5, which enables young players to achieve their academic and sporting potential.  Nine of our SSE Airtricity League of Ireland clubs have links with third level institutions.  The aim of our football for all programme is the delivery of football opportunities to people who may not ordinarily get a chance to play the beautiful game.  The programme comprises players from all groups and sporting bodies that cater for people with a disability who want to play football, and approximately 3,800 players participate.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, our football programme for the homeless and our late-night leagues, many of them in disadvantaged areas, continue to grow.  We launched the under-17 women&rsquo;s national league, with 11 clubs participating.  This is a further vital step to develop women&rsquo;s football at underage level.  Last year, we launched the glow football programme, which has the aim of encouraging young girls to become involved in football through a fun concept of playing indoor football to music in the dark under ultraviolet light.  Our FAI Aviva soccer sisters programme, now in its 13th year, will see girls between the ages of six and 14 attending football camps during the Easter holiday, bookings for which are already at record levels.  More than 42% of the 37,200 children taking part in thi<b>s <\/b>year's Spar primary school 5s programme are female, while 1,693 schools were involved.  More than 20,000 children from 1,038 schools took part in the 2018 primary and post-primary schools futsal programme, while more than 35,000 children participated in our Sports Direct summer soccer schools in a record 400 camps.  There were 2,245 participants in our school-club link programmes in 2018.  The FAI won the diversity and inclusion award at the 2018 Irish Sport Industry Awards organised by the Federation of Irish Sport.  In 2018, we rolled out the integration through football project and the sports welcomes refugees programme, both supported by the Department of Justice and Equality and the European Commission.  Four new development officers began work with the FAI during 2018 in Kilkenny and Dublin.  Two of the roles are solely dedicated to women&rsquo;s football, while one is for inclusion programmes. <br\/><br\/>These achievements and programmes can happen thanks only to the hard work and dedication of the players, the fans and our staff, and I pay credit to them all today.  I also apologise to them for the FAI currently being the subject of controversy and I hope a stronger and better association will emerge from our present difficulties.  This work could not take place without the vital funding we receive from the State.<\/p> <p>I want to repeat how grateful the FAI is to receive these moneys via Sport Ireland.  They go towards programmes such as those I mentioned.<\/p> <p> We appreciate also that receipt of State funding brings with it a heightened level of public and political scrutiny.  That is as it should be.  Nevertheless, the point should be made at this stage that FAI activities are primarily funded via UEFA and FIFA and through commercial and philanthropic sources, not to mention the various fundraising activities at local level in communities the length and breadth of Ireland.  This is not a one-way street, by which I mean football in Ireland, and our work in the FAI, brings with it not just huge social, health and community benefits, it also brings an economic benefit to the country and its economy.  Sport Ireland noted last week that for every euro it gives the FAI, the association spends four more.  This facilitates participation at grassroots level and enables us to reach out to all across the country who wish to play football and experience some of the excellent personal, health, community and societal benefits involved.<\/p> <p> Despite our success on the pitch, and in communities around Ireland, the past few weeks have undoubtedly been a difficult time for Irish football and the FAI.  We are determined as a board, and I am determined as president, that our sole focus shall once again be to promote football in this country.  I hope the processes that we are putting in place in the short term, and the long-term processes around governance and reform, will help to restore the committee's faith in the FAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000006#J01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554886200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Before we break, can I get a copy of Mr. Delaney's intended statement?

I want to address the committee on the issue of &euro;100,000 I gave to the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, in April 2017, which was repaid to me in June 2017.<br\/><br\/>First of all I want to say how truly saddened I am that Sport Ireland, which provided annual State funding of &euro;2.9 million to the Football Association of Ireland, has announced that it has temporarily withdrawn the funding to the association pending reports from the FAI, Grant Thornton and Mazars.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make it clear that I have urged a speedy response to the queries received from Sport Ireland, and I this week I have already met with Grant Thornton and with the FAI on these issues.  I will respond to any request to a meeting as soon as I hear from Mazars.<br\/><br\/>On Tuesday, 25 April 2017 we had an internal finance meeting at the FAI.  This meeting was attended by our director of finance, Mr. Eamon Breen, our financial controller Ms Yvonne Tsang, and me as the CEO.  At this meeting I was advised that if all cheques and FAI bank transfers issued to third parties at that time were presented for payment that the FAI would exceed its overdraft limit of &euro;1.5 million on its bank accounts, which were held with Bank of Ireland.  I expressed concern and surprise at the meeting as to how the FAI could have arrived at this position.  I recall thinking at the time that if I had been approached even a few days earlier I may have been able to better address the issue.  I asked if any funds were due to the FAI that could resolve the matter and I was informed that there was nothing due imminently that could be confirmed at that stage.<br\/><br\/>As the matter was pressing and we only had a few hours to resolve the potential issues that would arise if the bank overdraft limit was exceeded, as a precautionary measure and to assist the FAI I wrote a cheque for &euro;100,000 from my personal account to the FAI.  This cheque was made payable to the FAI and I gave it to our director of finance, Eamon Breen, telling him to only lodge the cheque if it became clear that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.<br\/><br\/>Later that afternoon I travelled to London and the next day I travelled on to Geneva, Switzerland, where I was attending UEFA business on behalf of the FAI.  I recall phoning our honorary secretary, Mr. Michael Cody informing him that I had made a precautionary payment to the FAI by way of a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 to assist in the event that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.  I informed him that I was very concerned and that I had to act quickly to assist the Football Association of Ireland.  I recall also informing the then president Mr. Tony Fitzgerald who was chairman of the board at the time.<br\/><br\/>The following day while I was in Geneva I received a call from our director of finance, Eamon Breen, informing me that there was a requirement to lodge the cheque by &euro;100,000 and he subsequently confirmed that request to me by email.  I agreed that the cheque should be lodged.  I asked the director of finance when I would be paid back and he said it would be as soon as the funds came in.<br\/><br\/>I subsequently received a cheque for &euro;100,000 on 16 June 2017 from the Football Association of Ireland, repaying the amount in full and which I lodged to my personal account on 23 June 2017.  I did not receive any interest payment and I would never have expected it.  I was only acting to assist the FAI and for the benefit of Irish football.<br\/><br\/>I recall asking the director of finance, Eamon Breen, if the FAI had any reporting or disclosure obligations arising out of the &euro;100,000 payment.  There was a board meeting on Monday, 19 June 2017 and the &euro;100,000 payment did not arise.<br\/><br\/>On Monday, 4 March 2019 I informed the board of the FAI of the precautionary payment I had made, following a media query received from <i>The Sunday Times. <\/i>On Saturday, 16 March 2019 I initiated court proceedings against <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>at my own cost in relation to this matter because I believed at the time that this information had emanated from documentation that had been filed in the family courts.  I accept that the overdraft limit issue arose on my watch as the chief executive officer.  I wish that it had not happened but I acted in the best interests of the association.<br\/><br\/>We have an excellent and committed finance and administration team and body of employees at the FAI, and many voluntary workers and players at all levels throughout the country.  I regret the embarrassment this entire issue has caused to them and the association but I did it in the best interests of football.<br\/><br\/>I will continue to assist fully the Football Association of Ireland in its engagements with Sport Ireland and Grant Thornton.  When called upon to do so I will do likewise with Mazars and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in their respective inquiries.<br\/><br\/>On legal advice I am precluded from making any further comments at this hearing in relation to the finances of the association or my former role as CEO, or on the &euro;100,000 payment, either directly or indirectly.In the interests of fair procedures and natural justice I have made this statement to the committee and attended this meeting voluntarily, as I have attended many Oireachtas committees in the past.  I am not in a position to answer any such questions here at this time.  Given that some members of this committee have made highly prejudicial public pronouncements about me personally prior to my attendance here today, and in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Kerins case, I ask that the committee respects this position.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to answer any other questions in relation to my current role as executive vice president responsible for UEFA and FIFA matters.  As most members will know I am passionate about football and always have been.  In my role as executive vice-president I look forward to welcoming the European under-17 boys championships to Ireland next month.  This will see 16 teams play and provide at least 9,000 bed spaces for tourism for the country.  Next year Dublin is one of 12 European cities to host the Euro 2020.  This will see four matches played at the Aviva Stadium, hopefully including the Republic of Ireland team.  We are currently bidding for the 2023 under-21 men's tournament with the Irish Football Association.  This is a very significant project and demonstrates how the round ball can unify both associations on this island.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to see a Women's Champions League final being played in Dublin at the Aviva Stadium, perhaps to mark the 50th anniversary of the Women's Football Association in Ireland in 2023.<br\/><br\/>I, as an executive committee member of UEFA, along with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England, am currently working on a feasibility study that we hope will result in the 2030 FIFA World Cup being hosted across these islands.<br\/><br\/>From a financial perspective UEFA would provide the FAI with somewhere between &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million annually depending on participation in major tournaments.  It is a significant funder of the Football Association of Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1554887400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>What was the taxpayer figure I had asked for earlier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554887400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Just before we broke the Chairman spoke about &euro;52 million in State funding - if that was the phrase - and the Chairman may have said FIFA-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554887400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>No.  I was talking about Sport Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R00700","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554887400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I understand that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554887400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>The FAI has received &euro;52 million from there, as a matter of fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554887400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Can I just clarify something on those figures if possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554887400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Of course, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R01100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554887400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Over the 20 year span from 1999 to 2019 it is &euro;52.9 million.<\/p> <p>It is very significant State funding and it is key to the delivery of our projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000012#R01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554888000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I did not catch the name of the financial controller, the third person at the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000013#S00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554888000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>It was Yvonne Tsang.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000013#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554888000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>We have agreed a rota of members to call on.

According to the association's financial accounts, the turnover in 2013 was approximately &euro;37.5 million, while in 2007, it had risen to approximately &euro;50 million.  In fairness, that is quite an increase and we must call a spade a spade in that regard.  From my perspective, I wish to put on the record that many clubs throughout the country are very supportive of what the FAI has been doing and I have spoken to some sponsors who believe they have been treated very professionally.  I have some questions about corporate governance, although I do not wish to repeat questions that my colleagues have asked.  I am very disappointed that documents which were not available to the committee in advance were submitted during the meeting.  It is regrettable and we should have received them in advance.  I was one of the members who spoke about that in private session.  Mr. Conway stated earlier that the bottom line which all our guests want is a much better and stronger FAI for everybody, that is, for anybody wearing the green jersey or any jersey, be it a club jersey or whatever, in any form of sport.  The FAI is an important and strong organisation.<\/p>  <p>  On corporate governance, would Mr. Conway, as chairman, handle any areas differently in hindsight?  Are there any areas where the FAI should not have acted, or where it did not act but should have done so?

In response to another member, I indicated that a root-and-branch examination of the organisation is overdue.  I do not say that because I see failures or an unsuccessful organisation, but any organisation should regularly engage, with external help, in some examination of how well it is equipped to implement its strategy, mission and purpose.  Part of me believes we should make the most of our current difficulties, although I accept that may sound a little strange.  For example, the Senator referred to corporate governance.  We have a corporate governance group but my colleagues on the board and I believe we need to move that on to something much stronger, with external persons on board.  We had this conversation with Sport Ireland and asked whether it wants a role in nominating people for the corporate governance group.  My colleague, Ms Walshe, is a member of the group, as are two external people who have previously been involved with the FAI, namely, Miriam Malone as CEO of Paralympics Ireland and Tom Jordan, who worked with some of our senior executives-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000020#Z00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1554892200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but I am concerned about my time.

A turnover of &euro;50 million is very significant.  There is nothing illegal about an employee giving a loan to a company.  Although it is unusual, it can happen, but it is highly unusual that the board was not formally aware of it.  It is also highly unusual that it was not reported as a note to the accounts.  FRS 102 and the association's legislation require disclosures of related party transactions, which is significant particularly in the light of the clear audit opinion the association received.  Questions, therefore, need to be answered.<\/p>  <p>  While I accept the evidence given by Mr. Delaney at face value and I do not seek anything personal or detailed outside of that, I am instead considering the matter overall.  Mr. Conway outlined monthly cashflows, projections, variance analyses and so on that are reported to the board by the financial controller.  I find it difficult to understand the figure of &euro;100,000 given that the FAI had a turnover of &euro;50 million and &euro;22.3 million in net total assets, with a profit of &euro;2.7 million in the year in question.  Could the FAI not have held off &euro;100,000 worth of creditors for a little while?  As Deputy O'Keeffe suggested, could it not have reverted to the bank to ask for another &euro;100,000 as a short-term facility?  There is a significant inconsistency in that regard.  While I will not challenge the former CEO, I will challenge the board on its engagement and corporate governance.  Mr. Conway might comment on that and, in particular, on the fact that the board was not formally aware of the loan for two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019041000020#Z01300","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554892200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>That is something we must learn from.
