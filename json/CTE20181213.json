The Bill was published on 14 November and concluded its passage through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last week.  I welcome the support received in that House for the core principle of community rating, which is long established and well supported Government policy for the health insurance market.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Harty, and Deputy Durkan for their support on this legislation. <\/p> <p>  This is a short and technical Bill comprising eight sections all focused on the specific issue of health insurance.  The amendments outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market and seek to keep health insurance policies at an affordable price for all citizens, young or old, sick or healthy.<\/p> <p>  Legislation is needed each year to update the amounts of credits paid to insurers under the scheme and the amounts of stamp duty levied on health insurance contracts to fund the credits. <\/p> <p>  As part of the process, the independent market regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, carries out an annual evaluation of the market, focused on the claims costs that every insurer has paid over the year.  Based on that analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits that should apply the next year.<\/p> <p>  The rates for next year, recommended by the authority, have been considered and accepted by the Minister for Health.  This year&rsquo;s Bill will provide for a general decrease in the credits across genders and age groups, and there will be no change in the stamp duty levy on contracts.  Maintaining the stamp duty levies at existing levels should ensure that health insurers do not increase premiums and that contracts remain at an affordable price for all citizens.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the technical amendments, this year&rsquo;s Bill provides for a number of amendments to the Acts governing the Health Insurance Authority and VHI. <\/p> <p>  In short, it is proposed to expand the membership of the Health Insurance Authority board; to broaden the composition of the VHI board; and to enable VHI to sell international healthcare plans directly.  I will outline each of these proposed changes in turn.<\/p> <p>  The Health Insurance Authority was established in 2001 with provision for five board members to be appointed.  Since then, the health insurance market has become more complex, with insurers adopting innovative marketing and product propositions to expand their client base and improve their risk profile. <\/p> <p>  Further significant changes can be expected as the Sl&aacute;intecare programme is implemented.  The role of private health insurance in our health system could change significantly, and the regulator must be able to react to this changing role and to advise the Minister for Health appropriately.<\/p> <p>  For the objective and effective discharge of its functions, it is desirable that the authority includes a broad mix of skills and experience and expanding the membership of the board will ensure they can deliver its strategy and address any challenges it meets.<\/p> <p>  The Bill also contains two amendments to the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, which are the governing legislation for VHI.<\/p> <p>  The first VHI-related amendment deals with board composition. Currently, the VHI board is restricted to having only two persons who are &ldquo;health service providers&rdquo; on the board.  This amendment will remove this restriction and includes a new provision that the Minister will give due consideration to the mix of skills present on the VHI board when making appointments, thus ensuring the highest standards of governance.<\/p> <p>  The second amendment to the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts deals with one specific area of VHI&rsquo;s business activities.  The amendment will permit VHI to sell international healthcare plans directly, not only as an agent as it is allowed to do currently, and it will remove the requirement for VHI to seek ministerial approval before selling these plans.  This development is consistent with VHI&rsquo;s current status as an insurer authorised by the Central Bank.  VHI is competing in a highly competitive and regulated marketplace and this amendment will remove the impediment to VHI&rsquo;s ability to compete with its competitors and thereby allow VHI to avail of potentially significant business opportunities. <\/p> <p>  The Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is long established and well supported Government policy for the health insurance market, and the amendments to the legislation governing the Health Insurance Authority and VHI are to allow these organisations to plan for future developments in this ever-changing and complex environment.<\/p> <p>  I commend this Bill to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018121300002#G00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544709600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544709600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Question proposed:  \"That section 1 stand part of the Bill\".<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544709600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I ask the Chairman's guidance, as I have questions that are relevant to the Bill rather than the specific sections and subsections.

The risk equalisation levy is a regressive levy if one assumes that higher-income households buy more expensive healthcare and lower income households, where they can afford it, buy less expensive health insurance policies.  Risk equalisation divides into two different types of policies, namely, advanced and non-advanced, and it applies a flat rate to them.  It applies a levy of &euro;444 to the advanced policies and &euro;170 to the non-advanced policies.  The advanced policies range in price from about &euro;800 to over &euro;5,000, whereas the non-advanced tend to be between &euro;400 and &euro;800.  Therefore the levy seeks a higher percentage from those with cheaper policies.  The difference with the premium, platinum-plated policies has very little to do with clinical care in the hospital but is more how fancy the room is and the trappings.  If my understanding of the levy is correct, we are essentially subsidising fancy rooms for higher-income families.  One way we could change this levy would be to apply it as a percentage of the price of a policy.  As part of the deliberations for the Bill this year, was there any discussion on changing the levy from what is broadly accepted as a regressive measure into either a neutral or potentially progressive one?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018121300002#G00800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1544709600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for his question.

One of the frustrations felt by some in the industry is that, in their view, the VHI holds unusually high reserves, which means it passes the overcompensation test.  That is relevant to the levy.  The belief is that it meets the criterion of keeping profits below 4% by moving an unusually high level of those profits into reserves.  I believe that, given the history of insurance companies going into liquidation here, the more reserves companies have the better and I do not suggest the VHI should have lower reserves.  However, it is relevant to the legislation because, by holding reserves which are significantly above the Solvency II levels, the VHI can manage its profit margin down and this has an impact on the rest of the industry.
