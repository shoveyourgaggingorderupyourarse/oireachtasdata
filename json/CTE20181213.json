Are the minutes of that meeting agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p><p>Are the minutes of 29 November and 6 December agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is matters arising out of the minutes.  There is not anything specific because the correspondence will cover most items.<\/p><p> The first item of correspondence in category A, briefing documents and opening statements, is Nos. 1788 A and 1791 A, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 6 December 2018 and 11 December, respectively, providing a briefing note and opening statement for today's meeting on the provision of school transport.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next item, No. 1790 A, is an opening statement from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The next item is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, as well as follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication.  We held over three items from last week's meeting for further review.  The first item was from Ms Mary Lawlor, public affairs manager, NAMA, dated 29 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee on Project Nantes with a breakdown of the &euro;24 billion in asset sales categorised by the jurisdiction of purchaser.  We requested a note from the parliamentary legal adviser on section 172.  We will deal with that, not today but as soon as possible.  We will consider that letter from NAMA as part of the briefing we will get from the parliamentary legal adviser.  We note and publish this.<\/p><p> The next item is No. 1767 B from the clerk to the committee of the Committee on Procedure, dated 30 November 2018, forwarding a complaint on matters raised by the committee in advance of the recent presidential election.  The complainant believes the committee raised the matter of presidential expenses in order that it would become an issue in the election campaign.  We agreed to note and publish a redacted form of the correspondence last week so as not to identify the person involved.<\/p><p> However, I propose that the committee draft a letter to the Committee on Procedure and a similar one to the individual who raised the matter stating that the committee's consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation accounts 2016, Vote 1 - President's Establishment, was within the remit of the committee and that the committee's work highlighted important issues regarding transparency in the funding of the Office of the President.

We held this over from the last day.  There is useful information in this correspondence that will feed into our periodic report.  We asked for a breakdown of various aspects of the claims.  The agency does not want to identify hospitals and talks about groups of hospitals.  We do not want to go there at this point in time - we can consider the matter next year.  However, there are two items.  It gives a breakdown on the number of claims for maternity services and the total number of claims.  One issue I had asked was, how much, out of what it pays every year, goes to the wards of court.  It has given the figures: in 2015, 2016, 2017 and up to 31 October this year, it was &euro;101 million, &euro;81 million, &euro;126 million and &euro;87 million, respectively.<\/p><p>The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has done a report on wards of court which the D&aacute;il will debate in the new year.  However, this is very interesting information that we have never seen before.  It seems to be the practice that in serious cases it is agreed in the court that the person be made a ward of court.  It looks as though a very high percentage of the payments made by the State Claims Agency are actually paid to the wards of court fund.  This prompts another question as the wards of court fund is outside the reach of public scrutiny whereas when it is in the State Claims Agency it is within public scrutiny.  I suggest we ask for one further piece of information in relation to that table 3, namely the total other payments for compensation so we can see the percentage of total payments to wards of court.  I asked a question merely on guesswork but I am stunned at the amount of money that is going directly to wards of court.

It is not acknowledged anywhere that the original application for these slides goes back to last April and May, in some situations.  It gives the impression that it is a shorter duration by virtue of the fact that there was a second application.<\/p> <p>  The key issue here is the format in which slides or photographs are produced.  I refer to them being usable in the event of a court case.  There was to have been a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  That was cancelled at very short notice, something like 12 hours notice, to the great disappointment of the 221 Plus group.  This is one of the issues that would have featured at that meeting.  Much of information here is accurate but there is one item of information that certainly takes a liberty - and a significant liberty. <\/p> <p>  The failure to begin with was that people were not given information about their own health.  That has now been repeated because some people, albeit a small number, have to go to court to determine whether these records can be released.

I have also been speaking to some of the ladies directly involved.  For public information, I want to touch on a few points in the letter.  It is an extensive letter with very detailed information.  We welcome the information provided.  It is the first time anybody will have seen this level of information on this matter.  I do want to make some points for people watching.  The letter states that in respect of the cytology slides it is a condition of the laboratory that it holds the document for up to ten years once testing has been completed.<\/p> <p>  The letter from the HSE continues on page 2 with the kernel of the issue Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned.  The HSE has put what it calls a protocol in place because it states that these slides are a critical piece of primary physical evidence that will be relied on by patients to advance their claims and by the laboratories and the HSE in defending any such claims.  An exact protocol was put in place by the HSE as to how the slides are to be released.  I will come back to that because it is relevant.  The HSE states that it wants to maintain the chain of custody and to ensure that the slides are issued through laboratory to laboratory transfers.  Even though the HSE, and the national screening service, is the legal custodian of these slides, they are normally held in laboratories.<\/p> <p>  It goes on to state that a digital image is taken to record the condition of the slide prior to its dispatch so as to ensure that if a slide is lost or damaged in transit, a secondary record of the contents of that slide will be available.  Typically, the taking of such images requires the input of a specialist cytologist or screener.  That is some of the reason for the delay.  I am just putting that on the record.  I am not agreeing or disagreeing.  It is being stated by the HSE that some of the issues patients have might result from a single patient slide being in one or two, or more, laboratories and more than one laboratory, therefore, might have to be contacted for some individual patients.<\/p> <p>  The letter goes on to state that early on, before the HSE established its protocol, some people, because it is their medical information, were contacting the laboratories directly.  The HSE was losing a chain of custody, as it calls it, of evidence that might be very relevant.  It put this protocol in place and that has ensured that the HSE now has a centralised approach.  I ask the Deputies to pick up on what I am saying when I am finished.  The HSE has stated that the updated position, as of Friday, 28 November, was that slides have been released under the protocol to 30 patients represented by 16 different firms of solicitors.  The number of patients who received slides following direct contact with the laboratories, before the protocol was put in place, was 18.<\/p> <p>  On the next page, the HSE gives the release time for 49 slides.  That is not 49 people because some people might have slides in more than one laboratory.  It is clear that 25% of them were well over the eight week period.  I cannot find this in the letter but the HSE has stated that, in its protocol, when arrangements are being put in place to meet a request for slides to be transferred from laboratory to laboratory, it must also be to an identified person with relevant experience taking overall responsibility for maintaining the physical environment in which the slides are stored and examined.  I think we have to agree with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#D01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#E00100","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I will move on.  The court case concerns the fact that some people want their slides released but not in accordance with the HSE protocol.  I think the essence of the case is not that people cannot get their slides.  The HSE states that slides should be issued according to this protocol.  People are saying they want their slides but not through the protocol.  Deputy Catherine Murphy may correct me if I am wrong.  I think this is why the HSE, from a centralised base, wants to maintain the chain of custody.  It states that if slides are being transferred from laboratory to laboratory and from named physician to named physician, it wants this done in accordance with the protocol and it probably wants to maintain the integrity of that protocol rather than this happening outside of it.  I am almost finished now, and Deputy Murphy may pick me up on anything she wants to pick me up on, but this is such an important issue that it is important to put this information out there.  Then it states, \"[A] firm has indicated that it wishes to have the High Court rule on the arrangements that should be applied to the release of slides where no legal proceedings are in being.\"  They might not be in being now but they might be at a later date.  The correspondence continues, \"For completeness, it should be noted that...on 8 November last, the HSE had not received the information necessary to release slides relating to the 51 patients in question (i.e. the 18 patients who have issued proceedings and the 33 other patients who have not).\"  What had happened in these cases is that the HSE had identified the laboratory in Northern Ireland; however, it had not given the name of the responsible person in the laboratory.  The HSE stated that it considers it likely that many of the requests that were referred to at our recent meeting are possibly part of that 51 in respect of which slides have not been released because the HSE has not been given the name of the person who was going to take custody for it in the laboratory in Northern Ireland.  The correspondence gives the turnaround times relating to the slides in the table on the following page.  If it looks as if I am defending the HSE, all I have been doing is summarising its position in its letter.  The essence of the matter seems to be that there are a number of cases held up in which the person in the laboratory has not been identified and the HSE states it will not give a slide to a laboratory unless it knows who the responsible person is.  Then there are other people who do not want to go through the HSE protocol.  This seems to be the essence of the court case.  I call Deputy Murphy.  That is just my reading of the HSE's letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#E00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I agree with a lot of the Chairman's summary.  Certainly, no one, not least the women involved, would want the original slides to be exposed to any kind of damage.  That would not be in anyone's interest.  Quite rightly, there is a protocol.  My understanding is that the protocol was deemed not sufficient by one solicitor who had experience of contesting a case in the courts and that this same solicitor, who has a number of clients, went back and suggested some amendments to the protocol within a week - this was in September - and has not been engaged with since.  It is important to say that.  Essentially, the HSE is stating, \"It is our protocol.  It cannot be amended.\"  My understanding is that the difficulty is that the resolution of the photograph of the slide that the HSE proposes would be not sufficient to show up the abnormalities.  What use is that?  This is the kernel of the problem.  Going back to our relying on information when a public body comes before the committee, we were told there was a 22-day turnaround.  It was as if we were inventing a problem.  This problem has been acknowledged in this letter and it will be further acknowledged next week.  I hope the matter does not have to go to court.  There would be absolutely zero point in going to court if there were a satisfactory outcome to the matter.  It strikes me that there was zero discussion of there being a problem here when we had representatives of the HSE before the committee.  I really take exception to that.  We must be able to believe what people tell us when they come before us.  The word \"candour\" has been used here on numerous occasions.  We would not have had to keep going back looking for information if it had all been outlined in the first instance.  There continues to be a problem, however, and I think the public would be surprised at this, given that the failure, or part of the failure, in the first place was not providing the information that was needed.

It does put its hands up and does not disguise this.  In its own way it is important we release this letter today because many people are looking for it and there is significant information in it.  Our discussion teasing out the issues here is probably helpful to the process.  I ask the HSE please to listen to what is being said here this morning because we were told these matters should not have to go to court.  If there are issues with the details of a protocol, I ask the HSE to try to sort them out without going to the High Court if at all possible.  I think we would be unanimous on this if it could be done.  I thank Deputy Murphy for raising the matter.  Without her pursuing it the last day, we would not have this correspondence today.

It is expected that we will be given a copy of this report in January.<\/p><p>The next item is 1782 B from Mr. Pat Smyth, interim CEO of Tusla, dated 4 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on procedures to secure service level agreements and the memorandum of understanding on information-sharing with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will note and publish this.  The important aspects of this letter are the following.  Regarding the memorandum of understanding on the sharing of information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla makes quite an issue of the data-sharing agreement and the legal services involved from both organisations.  I think they are getting advice on this.  Tusla states:<\/p><blockquote>Once approved and signed off, Tusla and [An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na] will agree an implementation strategy.  The time frame for implementation has been set as Q1 2019.<\/blockquote> <p>That is useful.  The other item Tusla gives is a full list of all the organisations with which it has commissioned a service level agreement.  I think every one of these organisations bar one has signed a service level agreement, and that one exception is in the process of being - to use Tusla's words - &quot;decommissioned&quot; from dealing with Tusla.  This is again progress on following up on these service level agreements.  We started with the HSE, we found a weakness in Tusla, we referred to it in our periodic reports and Tusla seems to be 100% on top of the job.  We will note and publish the correspondence.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence is 1784 B from Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, dated 5 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on the review of the pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes.  It includes a note on the progress of the Deloitte prospectus review and a note on the nursing homes steering committee.  We will note and publish this.  People may be interested in it.  It is a follow-on from the information we requested.  There are copies of minutes of meetings and of records of information.  That is useful.<\/p><p>The next item is 1785 B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing an information note on testing the constitutionality of excise law in a tax appeal case.  This was mentioned at our meeting.  He says it is not a matter for the Tax Appeals Commission to make any determination but, rather, it is a matter for the courts to decide constitutionality.  He provides information on high-income individuals' restriction and a summary of section 485F, carry forward of excess relief for the years 2007 to 2016.  This is as a result of a question I asked and it is good to get this in the public domain.  The correspondence concerns one of the reasons some high-wealth individuals pay quite reduced amounts in tax.  We understood that if they had losses, and if they had claimed this allowance and carried forward losses in a given year rather than using them all, they could carry them forward again.<\/p><p>Some people will be interested in that.  We asked for details of the fines imposed by courts in respect of tobacco.  We found them farcical.  For the millions of euro involved the fines issued were farcical, and the situation has become more farcical now.  Three cases went to court.  One person was fined &euro;12,000 and two individuals each received a fine of &euro;5,000.  One individual received a fine of &euro;5,000.  Any defendant who received a sentence had it fully suspended.  There is zero deterrent to smuggling in Ireland as far as I can see.  We talk about it every year.  The revenue or some other body should be given the authority to impose very serious fines.  All that happens is that smugglers lose one particular shipment.

We are keeping that man busy this week.  The item is a note on the record retention policy in place, in particular procurement documents, and changes that will be made to this.  There is also a note providing a list of supports available to those affected  by the H1N1 vaccine, that is, the flu vaccine.  This arose from matters concerning the procurement of goods and services and retention of records.  We found that some of the documentation concerning CervicalCheck was not kept on file.  That is where that query arose.  <\/p> <p>  The next  item of correspondence is No. 1,787 from Mr. Nick Ashmore, chief executive officer of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, dated 5 December 2018.  It provides a response requested by the committee regarding the value for money query.  I propose we forward a copy of the correspondence to the individual who raised the matter.  I find this response completely unsatisfactory.  From recollection I think we asked some questions.  A major fund is available to the SBCI.  It does not lend directly.  It provides funding to on-lenders, meaning banks or other institutions.  I want to know the breakdown of how much is provided through banks and how much is provided through non-bank on-lenders.  I find it extraordinary that on writing to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland we got back a three-page letter on money matters without a euro symbol in it.  There is a lot of lovely talk about policies and principles.  It could have been taken from the opening statement describing what the SBCI does in its annual report.  It gives us none of the information we are really looking for; how much the SBCI has loaned, how much the banks have loaned on, how much the non-banks have loaned on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#F01700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>We should go back to them again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#F01800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Certainly.

We acknowledge it, but we want a proper reply the next time.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1,789 from Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 6 December, providing information requested at our meeting last week.  These queries concerned contracts awarded without a competitive process.  There are very useful details here.  Mr. Griffin says that some of the issues relate to very specialised, unique expertise only available to a very limited number of contractors, or in some areas only available to one.

It is not an excuse for not having a tendering process.<\/p> <p>  The same applies to the contract to support the development of the national mitigation plan, NMP.  The Department says the process was shelved because the supplier is considered unique because of the research it offered.  Who considered the contractor unique?  Again, I do not accept that as a reason not to have a tendering process.  The same occurred with a NMP climate modelling contract worth more than &euro;600,000.  Again, there were no competitive bids.  The Department's reason is that the contractor has a specialist team.<\/p> <p>  There is a wider implication here.  Even if it was the case that these were unique specialist services, why is in-house expertise not being built up at the Department?  It was the same with the national broadband plan.  We have ended up with only one bidder because it seems that the only contractor left is the one that can do the job.  We all know why that happened; because of privatisation.  However I do not accept that for these contracts.  An awful lot of contracts are being awarded without any competitive tension at all.  We are given the excuse that the Department believes that the supplier is the only organisation or private company that can do the job.  That does not cut it.

The issue was that they seemed to be applying rules and people were being charged, some of whom were reimbursed, others of whom were reimbursed from a certain date but not the whole time period.  The person who contacted me took issue with the information that Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE provided to this committee.  I have unilaterally written my own rebuttal to Mr. Mitchell, putting a series of questions.  I sent it off lately, so I have no response.

The examination was carried out to ascertain whether the Department of Education and Skills can demonstrate that it is achieving value for money through its arrangements with Bus &Eacute;ireann to deliver the school transport service and whether there is adequate oversight of the service by the Department.  The special report was based on financial and service data relating to 2015.  The briefing material provided by the Department includes data for later periods and there have been some significant subsequent developments which the Accounting Officer will explain.  However, as the key findings of the report are likely to still apply, I will present them as reported.<\/p> <p>  Primary school children are eligible to avail of school transport services if they live not less than 3.2 km from their nearest suitable school.  The eligibility minimum distance for post-primary pupils is 4.8 km.  Pupils who do not qualify under the eligibility rules may use the school transport service if there is spare capacity on a bus route.  Such users are known as concessionary ticket holders.  Eligible children who hold a medical card and special needs pupils are exempt from charges for availing of the service.<\/p> <p>  The cost to the Department of school transport services in 2015 was &euro;173 million, or close to &euro;1 million per school day.  The bulk of the cost is accounted for by payments to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which received &euro;149 million in 2015, or 86% of the amount spent by the Department.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also collected a little less than &euro;14 million in fees from fare-paying pupils.  The balance of the expenditure by the Department is accounted for by various grants, including for special needs escorts and transport grants.  The average annual cost of transporting eligible pupils was approximately &euro;1,800 per head in 2015.  Fees recouped from fare-paying pupils amounted to a little more than 8% of the costs.  <\/p> <p>  Although there has been a steady increase in the total number of enrolments in primary and post-primary schools over the past decade, the number of pupils who are eligible for and avail of the school transport service has fallen significantly.<\/p><p>In 2007, the number of eligible pupils who availed of the scheme was 127,000 or 16% of enrolled pupils.  By 2015, this had dropped to 89,000 or 10% of enrolled pupils.<\/p><p> The school transport bus fleet is made up of a mix of large, medium and small buses.  Taxis are also used to transport some pupils with special needs.  Much of the service is subcontracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to private bus and taxi operators.  Payments to subcontractors accounted for 71% of the cost of the service provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2015.  Based on assumed average carrying capacities for vehicle types, we estimated the bus fleet as a whole had a potential carrying capacity of 163,000 pupils in 2015.  Relative to the number of eligible pupils, the estimated level of spare carrying capacity in the fleet was 48%.  Some of this spare capacity is taken up by concessionary ticket holders but the estimated residual spare capacity in 2015 was still significant, at about 35%.  There was also evidence that some ticket holders do not use the transport available on a daily basis resulting in further underutilisation.  At the same time, there is local demand in certain areas for concessionary access to school transport services that cannot be accommodated.<\/p><p> The examination also looked at the oversight arrangements in place between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We found that in 2015 the Department was still relying on arrangements that had been in place for over 40 years contained in a 1975 document entitled, Summary of Accounting Arrangements.  I concluded that the accounting arrangements provided for in the 1975 agreement are inadequate given the level of costs involved.  Reporting requirements are weak and there is an absence of key performance indicators or other metrics that would allow the Department to assess service performance and the achievement of value for money.  I recognise there have been some developments since the report was completed on a service level agreement.<\/p><p> The accounting arrangements provide for the Department to pay an annual lump sum transport management charge to cover Bus &Eacute;ireann's indirect and unspecified other direct costs.  The charge is provided for in the agreement at 13% of direct costs.  By agreement between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department, the management charge was capped at &euro;16.7 million in 2011, at &euro;15 million a year between 2012 and 2014 and at &euro;11.3 million for 2015.  Information provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the Department and the costs to be met from the management charge indicate that, notwithstanding the cap, the amount paid was in excess of costs in each of the four years to 2014, resulting in an accumulated surplus being held by Bus &Eacute;ireann estimated by the Department at &euro;11.2 million at the end of 2015.  The report includes a number of recommendations for improvement in the oversight and accounting arrangements.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief members on implementation progress in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544691600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to appear before it.

As the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated, progress has been made on implementing the recommendations since that time.<\/p> <p>  On forecasting, while the school transport scheme continues to be a demand-led scheme, in planning for projected demand the Department liaises closely with the National Council for Special Education in regard to projected enrolment trends at primary and post-primary.  The Department is undertaking a route audit with independent professional advice to ensure that route design is optimised from a value for money point of view, taking into account the location of eligible children.  In the process of preparing for that review, the Department worked with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the digitisation of its route maps.<\/p> <p>  The Department has strengthened the governance framework around school transport and continues to do so.  We have worked with Bus &Eacute;ireann to put in place a number of additional elements of our governance framework, which builds on the 1975 arrangement that underpins our relationship with Bus &Eacute;ireann on school transport provision.  A service level agreement has been put in place between the two organisations.  This sets out the reporting arrangements in place between the two organisations, the roles and responsibilities of both organisations, the agreed outputs to be delivered by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the key performance indicators for the operation of the scheme.  The agreement is under review and it is intended that an updated service level agreement will be put in place in 2019, with a view to further strengthening the governance framework around school transport.<\/p> <p>  Also in the context of reporting and performance monitoring, certain overhead costs and other indirect costs attributable by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the school transport scheme are known collectively as the transport management charge.  The Department commissioned an independent expert to carry out a review of the apportionment methodology for it.  The report was completed in March 2018.  The report provides a detailed analysis and classification of the costs incorporated into the charge.  Based on the recommendations of the report, the Department has developed a reporting framework and we are working with Bus &Eacute;ireann with a view to completing these reports initially on a biannual basis with a view to moving to quarterly reports.  In addition, the Department has been taking steps to reduce the accumulated surplus arising from the charge.  The surplus of &euro;11.2 million recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General' report will be eliminated by the end of the current year.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the final recommendation, all operational meetings between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are minuted and agreed by all attendees as a standing agenda item.  While it did not generate recommendations, it is noted that a central part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was an examination of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s procurement processes.  The report records that Bus &Eacute;ireann was compliant with public procurement guidelines.<\/p> <p>  I will mention two other areas of note in the school transport scheme.  The first concerns concessionary transport.  The purpose of the school transport scheme, having regard to resources, is to support the transport of children who live in remote areas.  We have heard about the distance criteria.  Families of eligible children living in areas where it is uneconomic to provide a transport service are eligible for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements if a service is not available.  A number of non-eligible children are also transported in those circumstances, where bus places are available, after all eligible children are catered for.  The transport is provided in the interest of maximising the utilisation of the existing fleet and in providing a service to families where the capacity exists to do so.  Since the number of spare places is dependent on the number of eligible children requiring transport, there can be no guarantee from year to year of a place for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria.<\/p> <p>  On the special education needs scheme, the purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  In general, such children are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school or unit that is or can be resourced to meet their needs.  Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of special education needs organisers, SENOs.  The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for these children.  This is reflected in the standard of service provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann, factoring the individual requirements of the children concerned into the planning of these services which generally operate on a door-to-door basis.  Eligible children are exempt from school transport charges.<\/p> <p>  At a cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017, school transport constitutes a significant expenditure of taxpayer money.  The scheme is under financial pressure from increasing demographics at primary and post-primary level but, more significantly, from the increase in the numbers of children with special educational needs being transported.  While cognisant of the costs associated with the scheme, and having taken on board the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Department is continuing to strengthen the process to ensure value for money in the delivery of the school transport scheme, while also ensuring that all eligible children are accommodated with school transport services.  <\/p> <p>  I am very happy to provide any further information sought and respond to questions from the committee.  As the Chairman noted, we are joined by representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544691600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I am joined by Ms Miriam Flynn, who is our chief schools officer, and Mr. Tom Delaney, our chief financial officer.  They have joined me as part of a new senior management team at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We are very pleased to be here to answer any questions and assist the examination of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p> <p>  We have been operating the school transport scheme successfully for over 50 years.  We do not exercise discretion on the policy and all applications are simply dealt with in accordance with the rules and guidelines.  It is important to note at the outset that the delivery of our operation on the ground is highly complex and the scheme is administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann on a cost recovery basis only.<\/p> <p>  The scheme has expanded dramatically in terms of vehicle numbers as the number of services provided under the scheme has increased from 1,700 contractor vehicles in 1998 to more than 4,500 now.<\/p><p>More than 460 new school transport services were approved by the Department and introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2017.  This year alone, another 300 new services are expected to be introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  The vast majority of these will cater for children with special educational needs.  All newly sanctioned services are opened to public tender by Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> With regard to the management of the overall network, 95% of Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet operates two double trips daily, with the bus used for different school runs both morning and evening, comprising two return trips.  More than 60% of contractors also operate double trips.  It is important to note that 83% of the costs of the scheme comprise payments to contractors.  Due to the nature of special educational needs routes, where the individual needs of a child are taken into account, many of these services are operated in single vehicles on a door-to-door basis.<\/p><p> On procurement, more than 90% of routes are subcontracted to private operators and 20% of these routes are tendered on an annual basis by Bus &Eacute;ireann in compliance with EU guidelines on procurement.  We welcome the finding of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which demonstrates that Bus &Eacute;ireann is fully compliant with public procurement standards.  This is testament to our stringent and equitable standards, which we apply to all our procedures and practices.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlighted opportunities for improved governance and I will touch on those.  There has been the introduction of a service level agreement, there are monthly operations meetings to review periodic financial and statistical reports and there are quarterly meetings with the chief executive and senior officials from the Department.  I can provide some context in the information we cover in this regard.  We provide a formal budget and projected costs for the financial year, which are agreed at the start of every year, and these consider both internal and external cost drivers, emerging trends, the anticipated level of demand and policy developments which may have a bearing on each of the cost headings each year.  We prepare a schedule of monthly payments based on the number of school days each month, the mode of transport and the eligible children travelling.  This is furnished to the Department at the beginning of each year, and it is designed to provide an estimate of the annual projected cost.  These figures are reviewed at monthly meetings and amended as required.  Sometimes there must be change, such as when there is a status red weather warning and costs have to be reviewed.<\/p><p> Individual statutory accounts are not produced for school transport as it is not structured as a separate company within Bus &Eacute;ireann.  However, all finances pertaining to school transport are audited and a separate statement of account for the school transport scheme is prepared as part of the company&rsquo;s annual independent audit.<\/p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann is committed to providing the highest levels of transparency to the Department across all cost allocations.  We have engaged specifically with the Department on allocations related to the indirect costs of staff, property and information technology, which account for nearly 85% of these indirect charges.  Most recently, we are in joint agreement that all these costs are demonstrably related to school transport.  A biannual review is in place to ensure that the basis for cost allocation is robust and transparent.  Bus &Eacute;ireann accounts are fully audited by Deloitte.  An additional audit of all school transport activity is undertaken to comply with the summary of accounting arrangement in line with the 1975 agreement.  This year and taking into account the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Bus &Eacute;ireann is in discussions with our auditors regarding a separate audit under general accepted accounting principles for the school transport part of our business.<\/p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s 2017 accounts noted that a &euro;6.7 million ring-fenced surplus was held within its reserves on behalf of the Department to be used solely for future expenditure on school transport-related activities.  In recent years, this has included spend on the creation of a new online ticketing system, an improved telephony and call management system and new school buses, all of which were authorised by the Department.  Currently there is no surplus in reserve and our 2018 financial statements will support this position.<\/p><p> On the subject of the special needs scheme, it has evolved in recent years with a significant growth in the provision of transport for special educational needs children.  This year, we received in excess of 3,000 new individual special educational needs applications or requests for amendments to services and this contributes to the growing cost of providing services.  It is also worth noting that while the volume of work has increased because it is complex to deliver, there has not been a corresponding increase in the costs of administration associated with this.<\/p><p> We welcome the expansion of the scheme in recent years and we are conscious that we must also continue to strategically refine our own resources, processes, procedures and technology supports to ensure we meet its growing needs.  We will do all that in close liaison with the Department of Education and Skills.  We are committed to full transparency and to continuing this close co-operation as the scheme evolves.  We fully enforce the rules of the scheme, comply with the performance requirements of the service level agreement and every day we try to deliver high standards of safety, consistency and reliability for all students who avail of the school transport scheme.  We do this on behalf of the State.  We have been operating the school transport scheme for over 50 years and we look forward to continuing to providing this vital service into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Deputy Aylward has 20 minutes and Deputy Connolly will have 15 minutes before we get to the ten-minute slots.

The roll-out of the bus system for schools was a good idea and I availed of it when I attended secondary school in 1968, which is a good few years ago now.  While it was a great scheme when it was rolled out, there is always a \"but\".  I am a rural Deputy representing County Kilkenny and every year, from July onwards, school transport, in particular concessionary tickets, causes me a major headache.  I will focus on that issue today.  As I mentioned, the service is good for most but it is not good for those who are left behind.  That is the problem.  I hear daily about problems and even last week a constituent with four children contacted me here in Leinster House about a problem.<\/p> <p>  Most parents work nowadays and it is not like it was years ago, when one parent stayed at home while the other was the breadwinner.  It has changed and both parents must work, so getting children to and from school is the issue.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party did some research for the 2016 general election and we updated the results this year.  It found that 350 pupils with concessionary tickets did not access the school transport service this year and that &euro;4 million would be sufficient to cover the costs involved.  I accept that is a simplified version and rolling out services to this group would be a different job for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is small money in the overall purse of taxpayers' money.  The Department and the Minister should address the issue.  I repeatedly bring it to his attention.<\/p> <p>  There was a recession and we changed the rules in 2009 or 2010.  Now that the recession is over, we should review the scheme and look after the 350 children who have been left behind this year, if my figure is correct.  We should try to include them in the school transport scheme.  Will the witnesses comment on that first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#O00300","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544691600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The concessionary element is a key part of this, as we organise the scheme on the basis of eligible pupils first and then concessionary pupils.  All pupils are supposed to have applied for transport by the end of April and all payments are supposed to be made towards the end of July.  The first problem is that people do not necessarily all apply and pay fees on time.  That is a challenge when it comes to organising routes.  Getting past that, Bus &Eacute;ireann, on behalf of the Department, must organise the routes, starting on the basis of the people who applied and implementing them on the basis of those who have paid.  Once all the eligible people who have paid have filled the seats, the remaining seats are available for concessionary tickets.  A large number of children are travelling under the school transport scheme using concessionary tickets.  In the 2017-18 school year, they numbered just over 27,000.<\/p> <p>  This year, there were approximately 3,000 applicants who applied for concessionary transport who did not receive it.  Of those, just 1,129 applied on time but did not secure a seat, while 1,888 applied late and did not receive a seat.<\/p><p>The figure is just around about 3,000.  We are speculating on a scheme here.  It is a matter for a Government to make policy but I do not mind taking this a little distance.  If were to have a scheme where concessionary transport was available to everyone then, we would have a different number of applicants.  Those applicants are on the basis of the scheme we have at the moment, not on the basis of a putative scheme that may provide transport for all concessionary users.  <\/p><p> We were very conscious of this being an issue.  Obviously on the establishment of the current Government, we had a review and published the outcomes.  We are continuing further work on the nature of \"concessionary\" and whether there is a way we can seek to meet some of the need that has been identified, such as for a large group of concessionary users - not individuals - who seek to go a certain distance and who may already be eligible for school transport.  We are exploring options in that regard and, yes, they would cost money.  They probably would cost more than the figure to which the Deputy has referred because obviously one must organise transport.  We are looking at that.  One of the tensions we have in the scheme is that we have a scheme where costs are going up, especially on the special education side.  We also have a tension, and it is an appropriate tension, to provide a social service to people who want to have it.  That is a tension always.  We want to make sure that we strike the right balance and that balance is obviously in the rules of the scheme and so on.  Yes, we recognise it is a difficult issue.  I am not sure it is as small as the Deputy set out and I am not sure it is even as small as I have set out.  If we had in place an open choice to be transported to anywhere up to a certain distance limit, that could actually cost a huge amount of money.  Obviously there may be room to develop the scheme slightly.  We are looking at whether that is a possibility and that would obviously cost money if we were to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I understand there is waste and will give examples affecting my constituents.  I have experienced this myself as I must drive through these areas.  A 40-seater bus serves a small place called Paulstown and brings children to Kilkenny but seven children have been left off.  I believe that it would not cost an awful lot of money to provide a 50-seater bus.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with the changes that have been made to the qualifying criteria for concessionary transport.  I know that the Department is not to blame for the changes because we, as politicians, are responsible for the changes.  I come from a little place called Ballyhale which is in the southern part of County Kilkenny.  In 1967, the three primary schools in the locality were amalgamated into one school.  For 40 years there were no problems and everything worked beautifully but all of a sudden these changes were made.  My grandchildren attend the school.  Unfortunately, after a service being continuously provided for 40 years in the parish, due to the changes that were made here, parents of the children have been told that they should send their children to a different parish because that school is nearer.  That is crazy stuff as everyone will agree who knows the loyalty that people have to their parishes, particularly in rural areas.  While I am not talking about all rural areas, people tend to be very loyal to their parishes.  There is religious loyalty because one receives the holy sacraments of baptism, first communion and confirmation in one's parish church.  All of that has gone on for generations and the same applies to hurling, football, soccer of whatever sport one plays.  Unfortunately, at the stroke of a pen we, as politicians, changed the criteria in 2010 or whenever.  Therefore, after three generations have availed of school transport, parents have been told they must send their children to their nearest schools.  I measured the distance that obliged one family in the parish, with three children, to travel.  It was 0.25 km and the family was told the children had to attend a school located outside of the parish.  We all know that one's loyalty is to one's parish.  The family was told this because of the new criteria and, unfortunately, siblings will be separated as a result.  The older siblings can attend one school but the next lot must attend school in another parish, which is nearer in terms of kilometres but not in any other way.  That is a crazy situation so we must review the matter.  I do not blame the Department for this situation.  It is us, the politicians, who must review the scheme.  I ask the Minister and my own party to review the matter and I hope it will be reviewed shortly.  I ask the Secretary General to comment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#P00200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544691600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I do not want to comment about individual situations but I will comment about the situation in principle.<\/p> <p>  If we were to say to Bus &Eacute;ireann you can run bigger buses where there are not enough eligible pupils for them, that is a policy change that costs money.  It can be done but it is a policy change that costs money, and it would have to be applied across the country and in all areas.  We have to have a consistent national policy.  Yes, that could be done.  Yes, it could cost a lot of money because Bus &Eacute;ireann run buses of different sizes at different times.  Yes, it can be done but, yes, it could cost a lot of money.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the amalgamations, the policy view was taken arising from the value for money, VFM, review.  There is a very good example in the VFM of a few Catholic schools that happen to be in the same Catholic parish, where parents were living closer to one school but only could get school transport to the school further away.  To be honest, we cannot set a scheme in stone in relation to amalgamations which were made 50 years ago.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>We did for 40 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#P00400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544691600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>We did for 40 years but we cannot set it in stone and it was reviewed.<\/p> <p>  The other point is this is about school transport.

This is not requiring them to attend school.  Parents can choose which school to attend, obviously subject to there being places in schools.  This is about the availability of school transport to support that.  I draw that distinction because I think it is an important distinction. <\/p> <p>  If we introduced and kept the level of choice to allow people to go to somebody under the former closed or close school rule, as well as the closest school, which was the policy dilemma, we would then have a myriad of choice, and a myriad of choice in transport costs a huge amount of money.  It is a reasonable policy to say that the State will support a child to go to his or her nearest primary school.

Approximately 95% of Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles operate more than one trip, morning and evening.  The same can be said of more than 60% of contractors.  Even though there may be spare capacity on one of the trips, the Department is still getting a more cost-effective network and better value for money.  I assure the committee that where capacity exists on a particular route, it is fully utilised to meet the demand that exists for concessionary transport on that route.  If there is demand for concessionary transport, any spare places are allocated on that basis.  This year, we probably have the highest number of concessionary pupils travelling.  The total number is approximately 28,400.  We aim to try to utilise capacity as best we can.  We also have to look at capacity in the context of the value for money it provides and the utilisation we get out of the individual vehicles.  I would like to touch on one other point, which is that there will always be an element of spare capacity.  If 35 eligible children present for travel, one has to procure a 50-seater vehicle.  There will always be cases in which a certain element of spare capacity exists anyway.  The key priority for us is to look at this issue in the context of the amount of utilisation we can get out of the vehicle and the cost that the State would incur if a separate vehicle had to be procured.

The hoarding of seats is a big issue in rural Ireland, where I come from.  I am talking about seats in respect of which tickets have been allocated.  I have received answers on this from Bus &Eacute;ireann on several occasions.  Seats are being allocated but are not being used; they are being hoarded.  The survey to which I refer was conducted for a month earlier this year on the bus that brings children from Paulstown to Kilkenny.  It was found that on every day of the survey, 11 seats were available on the bus - going in and coming home - and seven children were left on the side of the road.  The parents did this survey themselves.  The 11 seats that were not being used were being hoarded, perhaps by parents who were bringing their children to school on their way to work.  Perhaps they keep these seats for rainy days on which they cannot bring their children to school.  Something should be done about such terrible practices.  Seven children are being passed and left on the side of the road, even though there are 11 empty seats on the bus from Paulstown to Kilkenny.  I am just giving an example.  I do not mean to mention my own area all the time.  It is a crying disgrace to see 11 seats being left empty as the bus goes in and out, while seven children are left on the side of the road.

Bus &Eacute;ireann or the Department should wake up and do something about this.  If a seat is not used over a period of two or three weeks, it should be taken off the person who is not using it.  Some allowances can be made.  Parents are keeping these seats to use them on a rainy day when they are not going into Kilkenny for a work day or something like that.

Even though this is ostensibly a cost-based service, the report identifies serious flaws in the recovery of costs, particularly the management charge, which I will come to.  Oversight reporting requirements were weak, there was no service level agreement, and forecasting was poor.  The report makes three recommendations, within which there are a number of elements.  What do the officials from the Department have to say about the serious flaws in the recovery of costs?  I understand what Bus &Eacute;ireann has said.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding that the management charge was fixed at 13% of the direct costs, regardless.  It was capped at that level.  There was a surplus arising from that year after year.  The figure for \"accumulated service\" was &euro;11.2 million when the report was compiled, but it had decreased to &euro;6 million last year.  I might be wrong, but I think it was recommended that this should be eliminated on the basis that there was no adequate explanation from the Department of how it was fixed and so on.  Mr. McCarthy might correct me if I am wrong when I say the recommendation was to get rid of it.  I understand it is gone now.  Where has it gone to?  How did it happen?  If it was correctly done on a cost recovery basis, how was this charge allowed?  Where has it gone to?  I understand it has gone this year as a result of the special report.  Is that right?

First, I can recall a case of a second level school in the west where the patron had decided to close the school.  The Department did an analysis, having regard to school transport costs.  Notwithstanding that the school had 250 pupils, we calculated that it was more cost efficient and of more benefit to the local community to leave a second level school in the town.  There was a Catholic patron at second level and it transferred the patronage to the local VEC, as it was at the time.  Work like that can be done.  At a very high level, we have Project Ireland 2040 and we have economic targets to develop populations in the regions in scale.  I am on the project 2040 delivery board and a lot of work is being done to bring together perspectives from the different Departments to enable economic growth, including houses and jobs.  Obviously, educational infrastructure will link to that in the regions.  At a high level, there is a serious policy to seek to have diversity of economic growth and capital investment from the State to support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1544691600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Is that a \"Yes, we will look at that\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#W00500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544691600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Yes, that is being looked at.

It is a fantastic service.  I am aware of it from a person in my family.  The Department is rolling out a great service.<\/p> <p>  We must have been hardier in my day because I used to be on a bus for an hour and a half to two and a half hours.  We were hardier in the 1970s than nowadays.  I did not know there were restrictions on time.  At the same time, we were damn glad to get the bus.<\/p> <p>  In a case where the bus is full and there are no tickets available if anyone is even an hour late in paying, he or she is finished for the year.  I was involved in several cases where families forgot to pay over a weekend, or in one case it was only an hour late, and they were excluded for the year because they did not pay on time.  There was no appeal system.  Those who were late were just ruled out for the whole year until the following year.  Most of them learned from that and they paid the following year.<\/p> <p>  Parents are frustrated by the notification system.  They might be told on a Friday evening that even though the school is open on Monday no bus would be available.  That is frustrating for parents and people in general.  Working parents must make alternative arrangements.  An early warning system should be in place to warn parents, for example, a month in advance, that children on concessionary tickets will not get a place on the bus.  Something must be done about that.<\/p> <p>  In effect, there is no appeals system.  I have been through it on several occasions.  An inspector comes out and makes a decision and that is the end of the story.  He might come out a second time if one contacts him.  The inspector covering my area is based in Waterford.  However, there is never a change.  Whatever decision is made is upheld and there is no come-back on it.  In one case there was a third of a kilometre involved between two schools in adjacent parishes.  I did the journey myself in the car based on where the children were let off the bus in the evening and the distances were equal.  Even though I went to the inspector there was no give whatsoever.  Three generations of a family had been to the school concerned.  The family was told to go into a new parish for the sake of a third of a kilometre even though where the children were being dropped off meant it was the same distance between both schools but no one would listen.  That was the end of the story.  The provision of a place on a school bus was ruled out.<\/p> <p>  Another case concerning health and safety has been going on for years.  The Garda was contacted by parents as the bus was turning at a dangerous junction.  We appealed it on several occasions.  The inspector came out two or three times and said the bus would continue to turn at that point.  I thought it was very cruel that they did not take the safety aspect of where they were turning into consideration.  People were trying to drop children off on a bad bend in the road, and they were waiting for them with no place to park but they got no hop on that one.  I do not think the appeals system is working.  A better system should be in place for parents and politicians.<\/p> <p>  I have called on the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to amend the rules governing the school transport scheme which state that, routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis, to ensure who apply for a concessionary ticket can be accommodated.  I put the same question to the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  From an operational point of view, would Bus &Eacute;ireann be open to amending the rule and would there be a significant additional cost associated with amending the rule?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018121300002#AA02500","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544691600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>It is a policy political question and it is not for Bus &Eacute;ireann to comment.

The Bill was published on 14 November and concluded its passage through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last week.  I welcome the support received in that House for the core principle of community rating, which is long established and well supported Government policy for the health insurance market.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Harty, and Deputy Durkan for their support on this legislation. <\/p> <p>  This is a short and technical Bill comprising eight sections all focused on the specific issue of health insurance.  The amendments outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market and seek to keep health insurance policies at an affordable price for all citizens, young or old, sick or healthy.<\/p> <p>  Legislation is needed each year to update the amounts of credits paid to insurers under the scheme and the amounts of stamp duty levied on health insurance contracts to fund the credits. <\/p> <p>  As part of the process, the independent market regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, carries out an annual evaluation of the market, focused on the claims costs that every insurer has paid over the year.  Based on that analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits that should apply the next year.<\/p> <p>  The rates for next year, recommended by the authority, have been considered and accepted by the Minister for Health.  This year&rsquo;s Bill will provide for a general decrease in the credits across genders and age groups, and there will be no change in the stamp duty levy on contracts.  Maintaining the stamp duty levies at existing levels should ensure that health insurers do not increase premiums and that contracts remain at an affordable price for all citizens.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the technical amendments, this year&rsquo;s Bill provides for a number of amendments to the Acts governing the Health Insurance Authority and VHI. <\/p> <p>  In short, it is proposed to expand the membership of the Health Insurance Authority board; to broaden the composition of the VHI board; and to enable VHI to sell international healthcare plans directly.  I will outline each of these proposed changes in turn.<\/p> <p>  The Health Insurance Authority was established in 2001 with provision for five board members to be appointed.  Since then, the health insurance market has become more complex, with insurers adopting innovative marketing and product propositions to expand their client base and improve their risk profile. <\/p> <p>  Further significant changes can be expected as the Sl&aacute;intecare programme is implemented.  The role of private health insurance in our health system could change significantly, and the regulator must be able to react to this changing role and to advise the Minister for Health appropriately.<\/p> <p>  For the objective and effective discharge of its functions, it is desirable that the authority includes a broad mix of skills and experience and expanding the membership of the board will ensure they can deliver its strategy and address any challenges it meets.<\/p> <p>  The Bill also contains two amendments to the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, which are the governing legislation for VHI.<\/p> <p>  The first VHI-related amendment deals with board composition. Currently, the VHI board is restricted to having only two persons who are &ldquo;health service providers&rdquo; on the board.  This amendment will remove this restriction and includes a new provision that the Minister will give due consideration to the mix of skills present on the VHI board when making appointments, thus ensuring the highest standards of governance.<\/p> <p>  The second amendment to the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts deals with one specific area of VHI&rsquo;s business activities.  The amendment will permit VHI to sell international healthcare plans directly, not only as an agent as it is allowed to do currently, and it will remove the requirement for VHI to seek ministerial approval before selling these plans.  This development is consistent with VHI&rsquo;s current status as an insurer authorised by the Central Bank.  VHI is competing in a highly competitive and regulated marketplace and this amendment will remove the impediment to VHI&rsquo;s ability to compete with its competitors and thereby allow VHI to avail of potentially significant business opportunities. <\/p> <p>  The Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is long established and well supported Government policy for the health insurance market, and the amendments to the legislation governing the Health Insurance Authority and VHI are to allow these organisations to plan for future developments in this ever-changing and complex environment.<\/p> <p>  I commend this Bill to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018121300002#G00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544709600,"counter":817,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544709600,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Question proposed:  \"That section 1 stand part of the Bill\".<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544709600,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I ask the Chairman's guidance, as I have questions that are relevant to the Bill rather than the specific sections and subsections.

The risk equalisation levy is a regressive levy if one assumes that higher-income households buy more expensive healthcare and lower income households, where they can afford it, buy less expensive health insurance policies.  Risk equalisation divides into two different types of policies, namely, advanced and non-advanced, and it applies a flat rate to them.  It applies a levy of &euro;444 to the advanced policies and &euro;170 to the non-advanced policies.  The advanced policies range in price from about &euro;800 to over &euro;5,000, whereas the non-advanced tend to be between &euro;400 and &euro;800.  Therefore the levy seeks a higher percentage from those with cheaper policies.  The difference with the premium, platinum-plated policies has very little to do with clinical care in the hospital but is more how fancy the room is and the trappings.  If my understanding of the levy is correct, we are essentially subsidising fancy rooms for higher-income families.  One way we could change this levy would be to apply it as a percentage of the price of a policy.  As part of the deliberations for the Bill this year, was there any discussion on changing the levy from what is broadly accepted as a regressive measure into either a neutral or potentially progressive one?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018121300002#G00800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1544709600,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for his question.

I believe that, given the history of insurance companies going into liquidation here, the more reserves companies have the better and I do not suggest the VHI should have lower reserves.  However, it is relevant to the legislation because, by holding reserves which are significantly above the Solvency II levels, the VHI can manage its profit margin down and this has an impact on the rest of the industry.
