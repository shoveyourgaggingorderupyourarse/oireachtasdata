It further commits to ensuring the Shannon LNG project is not included in the EU Projects of Common Interest list in 2021. I have previously confirmed that if an LNG project were to apply for inclusion on the 2021 list of EU Projects of Common Interest, Ireland would not provide the required Member State approval and accordingly such a project would not be included on the list. I would note that no LNG projects in Ireland have applied for inclusion on the 2021 list.

This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across a range of different information campaigns.<\/p><p>The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a coordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community. This aligns with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. <\/p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals. <\/p><p>Campaigns have included national and local radio, national and regional newspapers and social elements across different platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok.<\/p><p>Last Spring a number of campaigns were run as restrictions were initially imposed at the onset of the pandemic in order to explain the measures and to reinforce public health messages. Other campaigns focussed on specific sectors and topics, including supports for business, the postponement of the Leaving Certificate, the Return to Work and Community Wellbeing campaigns.<\/p><p>In May of last year, the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopen Society and Business was published and a communications campaign was run to explain the different phases of the Roadmap.<\/p><p>During Summer 2020, the Jobs Stimulus Plan was announced by the Government and a campaign was run which focussed on restoring confidence and investment in the recovery.<\/p><p>In Autumn, campaigns aimed at Community Wellbeing and Keeping Well and reinforcing public health messaging were run.<\/p><p>The AntiViral campaign, launched in December, aims to engage with those aged 18-24, recognising that they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. <\/p><p>This campaign is a way to demonstrate the positive role that our young people are playing in beating back this virus. It has had over 5.7 million interactions on the social platforms and reached over 300,000 people in that age demographic. The AntiViral hashtag had over 1.1 million views and the campaign&rsquo;s positive sentiment was measured at over 60%.<\/p><p>Also in December, there were campaigns to inform citizens of the advice for having a safe Christmas with family and friends, and guidance on shopping safely, to reinforce public health messaging. <\/p><p>It is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.<\/p><p>Data from 25 of the Campaigns advertised in national press show an average reach of 49%, with 17 of these reaching over 50%. The average readership for the 25 campaigns was 1.9 million (with 16 of the 25 campaigns having a readership of over 2 million).

These are the inevitable outworkings of Brexit, a policy choice by the UK with which we did not agree, with the UK now a &quot;Third Country&quot; from a trade policy perspective having exited the EU's Single Market and Customs Union as of 1 January this year.  One such issue is where the UK acts as a distribution hub for goods, including those sourced from the EU, as referenced by Deputy O'Reilly.<\/p><p>In that regard, &quot;Rules of Origin&quot; are the premise upon which any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) seeks to confer the preferential tariff rates - zero in the case of the TCA - on the members of the Free Trade Area encompassed by the FTA, namely the UK and EU-27 in this instance.  The TCA outlines the conditions which have to be met for goods to avail of a preferential tariff when moving between the EU and the UK. The primary condition is that goods being exported to Ireland from the UK must be of UK origin to avail of the 0% tariff rate and goods being imported to the UK from Ireland must be of EU (including Irish) origin to avail of the 0% tariff rate on entering the UK.<\/p><p>As the Deputy points out, goods can potentially lose their Union origin if they at any point exit customs supervision or are released into free circulation after they leave the EU as they transit to Ireland.  Having regard to the Union Customs Code, which sets out the rules applicable for goods brought into or taken out of the customs territory of the Union, on 27 January this year, the Revenue Commissioners issued eCustoms Notification 14\/2021 which provides guidance and scenarios for the movement of goods from the EU to Ireland through the UK whereby the tariff may not be incurred.<\/p><p>For example, where the movement of the goods through the UK is a requirement, Revenue have advised that consideration could be given to using the &ldquo;transit procedure&rdquo; provisions of the Union Customs Code.  Under this mechanism, where EU originating goods are brought into the UK from an EU Member State, the goods can be stored in a customs warehouse in the UK and not lose their EU preferential origin thereby not incurring a tariff.  In this connection, there is a requirement to have a customs warehousing authorisation from HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (HMRC) in the UK and HMRC provide advice on the rules and requirements relating to the Customs Warehouse procedure in the UK, including the conditions associated with the operations which can be carried out on the goods while they are in the warehouse.  <\/p><p>This Revenue Commissioners' Guidance also addresses Inward Processing and Returned Goods options.<\/p><p>Alternatively, where there is no need for the goods to transit through the UK as part of the import, the direct movement of goods from the EU to Ireland should be considered as an option by Irish importers thereby avoiding the goods leaving the EU Customs Union or Single Market. Therefore, if goods travel directly from the EU to Ireland, for example from a port in France, Belgium or the Netherlands, the goods have not left the Single Market and the Customs Union and thereby remain in free circulation in the Union.  In this regard, connectivity between Ireland and Continental Europe has been significantly enhanced through additional direct ferry sailings\/capacity. <\/p><p>I should also add that my Department and the Enterprise Agencies are in constant contact with industry bodies including through our Enterprise Forum and the Retail Forum to identify where sectoral and regional impacts of the TCA are emerging at an operational level. We have a large number of Brexit supports including planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, the Enterprise Ireland Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000, as well as financial supports for adapting and restructuring business models and grants for research into new markets to assist companies respond to the new TCA dispensation. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland hosted a webinar last month on <i>&lsquo;Rules of Origin: How Rules of Origin affect your business to trade to, from or through the UK&rsquo;<\/i>.

The Agreement delivers on the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s objectives with businesses having access to zero rate preferential tariffs and quotas on goods traded between the EU and UK once the usual rules of origin for the EU-UK Free Trade Area are met.  This is vitally important for the agri-food sector, for example, which would otherwise have faced very significant additional costs and barriers when trading with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department, in conjunction with Copenhagen Economics, undertook a comprehensive study to consider the impact of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s trade and economy. Following agreement in October 2019 on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration for the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK, my Department commissioned further economic modelling to reflect the benefits of the terms of the Agreement and Political Declaration\/Protocol on Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  This Analysis forecast that growth levels over a decade would be 3.2 to 3.9 per cent below where it would otherwise be, depending on whether a \"best-case\" or \"worst-case\" scenario was modelled.  This outcome showed a reduction by almost half in the adverse impacts on the Irish economy that had been forecast for a trading relationship with the UK based on WTO terms, and the study identified a lessening of the negative impacts envisaged for the more generic FTA modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics analysis.<\/p>  <p>  As regards undertaking a specific appraisal of trade data for the first two quarters of 2021, I believe it is too early to commence a meaningful impact assessment of the concluded EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) at this point as certain parts of the TCA and the Northern Ireland Protocol have grace periods or temporary derogations attached to them. Furthermore, a framework for regulatory cooperation in financial services between the EU and the UK is to be agreed by March 2021 and the EU is assessing the UK&rsquo;s data privacy regime before deciding whether to grant a data adequacy decision in favour of the UK.  In addition, further changes will be introduced by the UK on 1st April and 1st July in term of SPS certifications and inspections regimes.  Therefore, we will not have sufficient statistical data available to assess the totality of the impact of the TCA until such temporary derogations and all elements of the Agreement are fully in force, including any further easements or derogations that may be agreed under the TCA structures.  However, I am fully committed to such post-implementation evaluation at an appropriate point, as soon as sufficient statistical data are available.  That assessment will have to take account of the impact which stockpiling ahead of 1st January and dampening in demand due to the pandemic, may have on such data, esp. as between the UK and Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, in advance or a macro-economic assessment, I should note that my Department and the Enterprise Agencies are in constant contact with industry bodies including through the Enterprise Forum which I chair and the Retail Forum, chaired, by Minister Damien English, to identify where sectoral and regional impacts of the TCA are emerging at an operational level.  In addition, Minister Robert Troy, in light of his responsibilities for trade promotion, has engaged in extensive outreach with business groups to address the many logistical challenges that the TCA has presented us with.  We have a large number of Brexit supports including planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, the Enterprise Ireland Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000, as well as financial supports for adapting and restructuring business models and grants for research into new markets to assist companies respond to the new TCA dispensation.

This will be done in the context of the doubling of the electricity generated from renewable sources to 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s final consumption and the achievement of net zero emissions by 2050. I expect that the review will be completed by the end of 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000078#WRF07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Infrastructure","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000078#WRF07300"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[12496\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000078#WRF07400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when a property (details supplied) will be able to avail of broadband.","asker":"1596","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>The Question refers to a premises located in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website <font color=\"#0000FF\">. <\/font>The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.<\/p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic.

In addition to energy efficiency measures, the decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector will be achieved through renewable energy measures such as\u00a0the\u00a0Support Scheme for Renewable Heat and further electrification of the sector\u00a0by the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The development of renewable energy sources\u00a0will\u00a0contribute\u00a0to sustained and sustainable economic growth\u00a0by supporting economic activity and new jobs, reducing our reliance on imported fossils fuels, and mitigating the long-term damage that rising greenhouse gases\u00a0will cause to the national, European\u00a0and global economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000079#WRG06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Pollution","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000079#WRG06700"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[12866\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000079#WRG06800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of inspections that have been carried out in 2019 and 2020 regarding compliance with the Air Pollution Act 1987; the number of samples that have been taken during this period; the percentage of samples that breached the regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>Enforcement actions under the Air Pollution Act are a matter for Local Authorities and my Department does not compile statistics in relation to inspections undertaken or enforcement actions initiated.

The policies and measures in\u00a0Climate Action Plan 2019 are designed to ensure that Ireland meets this target.  Within the Climate Action Plan there are specific targets for the energy sector\u00a0to meet.  The Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2\/cost optimal and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  The development of the National Retrofit Programme to achieve these targets is\u00a0well underway. &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes.  This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.  This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives.  The funding has already supported calls for projects under the new National Retrofit (One-Stop-Shop Development) Scheme and the Community Energy Grant Scheme, as well as a &euro;47 million increase in funding for energy poverty schemes.  Further SEAI administered retrofit initiatives will be launched in the coming months.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Climate Action Plan also sets a target for 70% renewable electricity by 2030.

Wind was the largest share of renewable electricity at 32% with hydro at 2.8% and other renewables including biomass at 2.7%.  The European Green Deal commits to delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions at EU level by 2050 and increasing the EU-wide emissions reduction target from 40% to up to at least 55% by 2030, to align with the goal of the Paris Agreement limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

In addition, effect can only be given to an international convention as it stands at the time of the enactment of the Act. As a result, primary legislation is required to update the definitions of the various Conventions as they are amended.

This has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses during the months of December and January. The pilot is now being evaluated. The RSA is fully committed to extending the service to all categories of vehicles, however, I would like to highlight, this expansion of services will take some time.

To cope with the initial four-month suspension, the service increased capacity from an average pre Covid-19 capacity of 15,000 to over 25,000 monthly. A plan is being progressed to increase this capacity up to 50,000 per month when service resumes, to manage the backlog of customers and shorten waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  As you can appreciate, the first priority has to be public safety &ndash; we want to provide services, and we know that people are looking for services, but services can only be provided to the limit possible while preserving public health.<\/p>  <p>  As the scheduling of candidates is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and their contract provider, I have no power to intervene in individual cases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000081#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000081#WRJ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[12587\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000081#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount of state aid that has been granted to the Shannon Airport Authority since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.","asker":"1519","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, from early in the Covid crisis, the Government put in place a broad range of unprecedented supports to help mitigate the effects of the pandemic on business, including a wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, a commercial rates waiver and deferred tax liabilities.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector.<\/p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 <i>Climate Action Plan<\/i>, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The Government, supported by the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce<\/i>, has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base. There are currently around 28,000 EVs under taxation in Ireland and, of these, according to recent figures from the National Vehicle and Driver File, 14,363 fully electric vehicles are registered in Ireland.<\/p><p>In accordance with Programme for Government commitments, my Department is expanding the scope of vehicle types to include personal electrified modes of transport. For example, legislation is being drafted to enable the legal use of electric scooters. Subject to resolution of outstanding issues relating to road safety and the movement of traffic, I intend to bring forward amendments to the relevant primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill comes before the Oireachtas in the next few months. Accordingly, I am confident that we are making real progress towards the delivery of our ambition for the transition to an electrified and low-carbon transport system.<\/p><p>With regard to public transport, moves are already afoot to electrify the bus and rail networks. To date, a total of 280 diesel-electric hybrid buses have been ordered, of which 100 should be operational by mid-2021, with the remainder to be delivered before year end. The National Transport Authority (NTA) are also tendering for both single- and double-deck fully electric town buses, with the first vehicles expected to arrive towards the end of next year. My Department is also funding electric vehicle pilot projects in rural areas under the Local Link programme.<\/p><p>Finally, building on the eSPSV grant scheme that was in place for the last 2 years, I have introduced an EV scrappage scheme to support taxi and hackney drivers switching from older vehicles to EVs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000082#WRK07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Car Test","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000082#WRK07100"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[13304\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000082#WRK07200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason that persons, who had NCT tests due before 28 March 2020, were not given a four-month extension on their NCT validity despite the fact that they could not secure tests in NCT centres for a number of months thus resulting in some drivers having only seven to eight months NCT certificate validity after testing; the reason the four-month extension was not granted across the board in view of the exceptional circumstances at the time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Competition in the sector is vital to ensure that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit. <\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal of Ulster Bank is regrettable for its customers and staff and is an unfavourable development for competition in the banking market. It is also a reflection of the wider challenges banking is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad.  The impact of Covid-19, coming on top of weak enough economic growth in Europe and America, has already been seen in European banking with consolidation and mergers in other European markets. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, our banks were amongst the worst hit by the previous crisis. Since then, overall conditions for banks have been difficult despite Ireland&rsquo;s strong recovery from the previous crisis. These conditions include the long period of low, now negative, interest rates that have severely depressed margins, having to continue to deal with the bad debt legacy of the last crisis, low credit demand, both in mortgages and SME lending and the relatively small size of the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are major changes driving the consolidation elsewhere. The innovations introduced by fintechs and their increasing market penetration are reducing traffic into the branch networks run by traditional banks. Competing with lean and nimble online firms while coping with high cost structures is posing a considerable challenge for the traditional full service sector and we are seeing cutbacks in these entities in terms of staff, branches and initiatives to move their customers online.  <\/p>  <p>  The announcement by Bank of Ireland last week that it is to close 103 branches in Ireland &ndash; 15 of which are in the north - is further evidence of the impact technology is having on banking and the way the public interacts with banks.  However, it is accepted that many people will still need or want to carry out their banking activities in person and it is a welcome development that Bank of Ireland is now entering into a new partnership with An Post that will allow personal and business customers to use their local post office for a range of banking services, including cash withdrawal and lodgements.<\/p>  <p>  NatWest is in early stage discussions with PTSB and other strategic banking counterparties about their potential interest in certain retail and SME assets, liabilities and operations.

While these are primarily commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for both AIB and PTSB, but more importantly for Ulster Bank&rsquo;s customers, staff and the Irish economy generally. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000083#WRL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000083#WRL03600"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[12512\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000083#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of the standard VAT rate being reduced from 23% to 21% for a six month period from 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2021; if an analysis of this policy decision is being carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>The temporary reduction in the standard rate of VAT to 21% announced in the July Stimulus Package was projected to cost &euro;440m.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is not yet possible to calculate the actual cost foregone as VAT tax returns, which are usually filed by traders every two months, do not report collection by VAT rate.<\/p><p>The Revenue Ready Reckoner published at  contains, on page 28, the most current estimates of the likely cost foregone from various changes to VAT rates or extensions to the current rates.

The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs, it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce legislation to allow banks to differentiate between customers in different sectors.

The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;9,207,244, and the potential tax cost is &euro;1,841,449, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question about the amount paid out under the scheme, Revenue have advised me that when it comes to tax credits, some taxpayers will get refunds whereas some will have the credit to offset against underpayments along with a number of other credits they claim. As at 7 March 2021 a total of 8,995 claims have been included in Income Tax Returns for 2020 for the Stay and Spend credit. These claims relate to &euro;3,206,048 of the qualifying expenditure recorded on the Revenue Receipts Tracker to date and the tax cost of same amounts to some &euro;641,000. However, as the filing deadline for the 2020 Income Tax Return is not until 31 October 2021, information on the total number of claims and cost for the 2020 year of assessment will not be available until after the filing date and the returns have been processed.  Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this new scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme.<\/p><p>Decisions on next steps relating to the scheme have yet to be taken and I will continue to assess matters as circumstances evolve. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000083#WRL05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000083#WRL05900"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[12665\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000083#WRL06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the current rates allowed under the e-working tax relief can be increased given the current shortfall for employees in the difference between the maximum rate of employer allowed working from home allowance before tax is applicable and the e-working tax relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>Where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC. Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.<\/p><p>This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer. The value of relief allowed under the Irish system is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers. The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free. By contrast, the weekly rate in the UK is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum.<\/p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.<\/p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.<\/p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home.<\/p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p><p>Borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements.

The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements.

Together these statutory provisions ensure that any issues to be determined between a financial service provider and its customer, can be determined by one forum, being the one more suitable to the particular circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000084#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000084#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[13188\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000084#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the breakdown of individual consumption per capita across Ireland's NUTS III regions from 2008 to date.

Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: <\/p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its business premises. <\/p><p>To make a claim under the CRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made. <\/p><p>Domestic travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  To be eligible to make a claim under the CRSS, the applicable restrictions must require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing the business premises in which the relevant business activity is carried on.<\/p><p>In relation to the eligibility of hotels to claim under the CRSS, I understand the Deputy is referring to a statistic that was included in a media statement made by the Irish Hotels Federation on 11 December 2020.  At that time, public health restrictions had been eased, with a phased move to a revised Level 3 restrictions applying nationally, which meant that hotels were allowed to reopen to provide accommodation services to the general public.  Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools, including those within hotels, were also allowed to reopen for individual use.  Where, on the relaxation of restrictions, a hotel ceased to be substantially restricted, and therefore ceased to be eligible to claim under the CRSS, it could claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under the scheme (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist it with the costs of reopening at that time.<\/p><p>Since 24 December 2020 hotels have, under public health regulations, been required to close to the public (other than for guests who had a booking and were due to check in up to and including 26 December 2020), with limited opening allowed only for essential non-social and non-tourist purposes.  Therefore, hotels are currently eligible to make a claim under the CRSS because public health restrictions are in place which require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises.  <\/p><p>In relation to eligibility criteria and increasing the rates of the scheme, I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS or to increase the rates. The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme. Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.  <\/p><p>The legislation provides that the Scheme will run to 31 March 2021 but may be extended by Ministerial Order (subject to D&aacute;il approval) but not later than 31 December 2021.  <\/p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to supports and, as Deputies will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that both the EWSS and the CRSS are now to be extended until the end of June 2021. <\/p><p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of the second quarter of 2021.<\/p><p>Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.<\/p><p>The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000084#WRM05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":727,"content":"<p>Question No. 297 answered with Question No. 288.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":728,"content":"<p>Question No. 298 answered with Question No. 268.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000084#WRM05400"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[13329\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000084#WRM05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider lifting the four-year rule for recoupment of overpayment or refunds for a short period during the Covid-19 pandemic to allow struggling businesses claim back refunds beyond this period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the time limit for making refunds of overpaid tax is set out in section 865 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.

The report was sent to Government and published in December 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The report contained 15 recommendations, grouped under the following subject areas:<\/p>  <p>  - Leveraging role of state supports for SMEs infrastructure to address market gaps;<\/p>  <p>  - Reducing financial exclusions and managing of existing information by credit unions, An Post and local authorities;<\/p>  <p>  - Enhancing competition;<\/p>  <p>  - Reducing information asymmetries and building skills; and<\/p>  <p>  - Enhanced responsibility for commercial banks.<\/p>  <p>  These recommendations are listed below and were a matter for a range of Departments and Agencies.  The Deputy should note that Recommendations 9 and 11 matters for my Department.  Following publication, I circulated the report directly to the relevant Ministers and Agencies and asked them to consider the recommendations relevant to their organisation.  Any subsequent implementation would be a matter for said Departments and Agencies, based on their own considerations and who will be able to supply further information if required by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 1: &ldquo;Continue to target rural enterprise support in future counter-guarantee loan schemes.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) operates a number of schemes on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is the largest loan guarantee scheme in the history of the State. The Scheme provides &euro;2 billion in lending, for terms up to five-and-a-half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million at below market interest rates and is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (business with less than 500 employees). The scheme, which was developed under European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary State-Aid Framework enabled the inclusion of primary producers. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;800m in lending available to SMEs and small mid-caps. Like the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme is available to businesses engaged in primary agriculture and aquaculture (the farming and seafood sectors), supporting businesses in these sectors as they seek financing for long-term investment. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 2: &ldquo;Expand Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s mandate to provide enterprise loans of up to &euro;50,000.&rdquo;  <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that Microfinance Ireland provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  <\/p>  <p>  With the arrival of COVID-19 in Ireland and the subsequent impact on businesses across the country, as an emergency measure Microfinance Ireland introduced the COVID-19 Loan Scheme to provide support to microenterprises directly impacted by the effects of the virus.  Phase 1 of the scheme had significant demand with the equivalent of three years lending provided in a four-month period. Phase 2 of the scheme commenced in August 2020 and MFI customers can apply for a COVID-19 Business Loan up to &euro;25,000 in addition to their existing borrowings, subject to a maximum credit exposure of &euro;50,000. <\/p>  <p>  The Department Enterprise, Trade and Employment has assured me that it will continue to work with MFI to provide appropriate loans to microenterprises.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 3: &ldquo;Promotion by Local Enterprise Offices of Micro Enterprise Loan Fund.&rdquo;  <\/p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Offices are bodies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the LEOs actively work with MicroFinance Ireland to promote their loan fund. The LEOs submitted 751 loan applications to Micro Finance Ireland in 2020.The LEOs have a provisional target to submit 550 loan applications to Micro Finance Ireland in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 4: &ldquo;Set ambitious targets for regional impact of any revised Brexit loan scheme.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that while there are currently no regional targets for the Brexit Loan Scheme, analysis of applications indicates a good geographical spread of beneficiaries. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that work is under way to scope potential options for adjustments\/revisions to the Brexit Loan Scheme, however given the structure of the scheme, which is counter-guaranteed by the European Investment Fund through its InnovFin SME guarantee facility, there may be limitations on the extent of any alterations to the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Any revised Brexit Loan Scheme will be promoted across the regions.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 5: &ldquo;Consider new initiatives to support expansion of SME lending by newer platforms.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) significantly expanded the number of on-lenders offering SBCI products over the course of 2020.  The participation of non-bank credit providers (3 signed, 3 to sign in near future) and the inclusion of 19 Credit unions in the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee scheme (CCGS) has significantly broadened the access to guarantee schemes both by type of institution and by geographic spread, and has increased access to the target audience considerably.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of non-bank finance providers has allowed SBCI products be delivered via new lending platforms and has brought competition and choice to the market.<\/p>  <p>  SBCI also increased the number of on-lenders participating in delivering the Future Growth loan Scheme (FGLS) by two, increasing the number to six participating institutions. SBCI also has a permanent open call on its website for interested on-lenders to apply for liquidity facilities to help increase price competition and customer choice.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 6: &ldquo;Expansion of Personal Micro Credit Scheme by member-owned credit unions.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  This is a policy matter for the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Personal Micro Credit Scheme (PMC) provides for small scale loans, known as \"It Makes Sense\" loans, ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;2,000, by Credit Unions to borrowers in receipt of social welfare payments who may have difficulty accessing low cost credit. Currently 107 credit unions at some 281 locations are participating in the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  An Post facilitates the repayment of these loans for social welfare recipients who receive their payment through a Post Office, by utilising the Department of Social Protection's Household Budgeting Facility. As part of a pilot scheme since Q1 2020, the Department of Social Protection has funded the weekly administrative cost for access to the Household Budgeting Facility.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 7: &ldquo;Facilitation of new providers to enhance access to credit in communities.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation focusses on potential for the An Post or other community-based providers to increase access to credit. <\/p>  <p>  My role in relation to the provision of financial services specifically by the post office network relates primarily to payment services, for which I as the Minister for Finance authorise An Post to provide. This authorisation is under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 (Section 67) Order 2016. <\/p>  <p>  For all other matters related to the post office network, I defer to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communication, Mr Eamon Ryan, TD. An Post is a body under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.<\/p>  <p>  While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  Initiatives by the SBCI are outlined above under Recommendation 5.  SBCI is currently exploring a number of new initiatives in partnership with both existing and new on-lenders that will further increase the level of competition and choice in the market, particularly in relation to emerging opportunities associated with the Green agenda and energy efficiency.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 8: &ldquo;Development of initiatives by local authorities as part of digital strategies to assist individuals to apply online for banking services.&rdquo;  <\/p>  <p>  Policy on local authorities is the responsibility of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 9: &ldquo;Support the Credit Union Market to deliver Expanded Range of Community Banking Services.&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  Credit Union policy is a responsibility under my Department.  Revised Central Bank lending regulations were enacted on 1 January 2020 which materially expanded the lending capacity of the sector, including for mortgage and SME lending. The sector had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of &euro;344 million at end 2020. More recently, I welcomed the announcement that nineteen credit unions have been approved to participate in the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS).<\/p>  <p>  The Government is supportive of credit unions who have the financial strength, the competence and the capability, undertaking more SME and mortgage lending. However, the decision to lend is to be made by the board of each individual credit union, taking into account their own specific commercial, risk appetite and regulatory factors.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also aware that many credit unions have improved their digital offerings.  In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. To date, 54 credit unions have been approved to provide MPCAS.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of a number of collaborative projects underway to support finance for retro-fitting and agri-lending, as well as collaborative projects being developed in the areas of SME lending, insurance and investment in social housing. These are all positive examples of how many credit unions are widening their products and services for their members. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Government has committed to a review of the policy framework for credit unions in the Programme for Government. This project is already well advanced.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 10: &ldquo;An Post to explore and discuss with its parent Government Department, NewEra, and, where appropriate, the Department of Finance, the possibility of investing in partner financial organisations, where such investment is commercially viable and where it would enhance competition in lending market.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Please see information provided on Recommendation 7.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 11: &ldquo;Extend Exemption for New Community Banking Entrants from Notification of Charges for 5 Years.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation is still under consideration by officials in my Department.  Indecon accepted that the current 3 year exemption is not a major barrier.  The extent of any additional attraction for new community banking entrants is limited and has to be balanced against the potential impact on consumers dealing with such new entrants.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 12: &ldquo;Development of Technology Based Lending Tool Kit by Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices.&rdquo;  <\/p>  <p>  Please see information provided on Recommendation 13.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 13: &ldquo;Advisory supports by Local Enterprise Offices to include assistance with preparation of lending applications.&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices are bodies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that The LEOs offer financial mentoring which helps firms with the preparation of lending applications. The LEOs also offer financial training which upskills small business owners and managers to be in a position to prepare their own loan applications.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 14: &ldquo;Skillnet Ireland to offer analysis of lending requirements as a component in their Management Development Programmes.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Skillnet Ireland is a State agency under the aegis of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 15: \"Commercial Banks should consider the establishment of an increased number of Community Banking Hubs or provide alternative methods of banking services delivery in areas where branch closures may have hindered access to banks.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation is a matter for the commercial banks and the Deputy will be aware that decisions in regards to operational matters are the sole responsibility of the boards and management of the individual banks which are run on an independent and commercial basis. Furthermore, the independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks are publicly available and were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am advised that the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) states that a bank must not, through its policies, procedures, or working practice, prevent access to basic financial services. The Central Bank adopts a &lsquo;technology neutral&rsquo; approach meaning that the same principles of regulation, including the rules of the Code, apply equally to both digital and traditional delivery environments.<\/p>  <p>  Branch closures are always a matter of regret, and I as Minister, would hope that closures are kept to the minimum necessary for financial sustainability. Where there are branch closures, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code must be complied with.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p><p>Borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The BPFI reported, that as of 31 December 2020, approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% were receiving other supports from lenders.<\/p><p>As Minister for Finance I have no function in the commercial decisions made by banks. However, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.<\/p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.<\/p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.<\/p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000084#WRM06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":744,"content":"<p>Question No. 305 answered with Question No. 290.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":746,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[13433\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000085#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider extending the current tax warehoused at 0% from 12 months to an additional 48 months given that some businesses have remained closed throughout the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

For example, if a business has been closed due to Covid-19 restrictions but resumes trading in April 2021, it will be able to warehouse liabilities accrued from March 2020 up to the end of June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that where a business re-opened but has had to close again due to the re-imposition of restrictions, the trade is deemed to be still subject to the restrictions provided for in the regulations under sections 5 and 31A Health Act 1947 until it has re-opened again.  This means that VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS liabilities for such businesses can continue to be warehoused in respect of the extended restricted period.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the expiration of Period 1, businesses are afforded a further 12 months (&ldquo;Period 2&rdquo;) during which collection of warehoused liabilities will be deferred.<\/p>  <p>  No interest will be charged on outstanding Covid-19 liabilities in either Period 1 or Period 2.  In cases where businesses have been subject to re-imposition of restrictions intermittently since March 2020, the earliest liabilities warehoused (Jan\/Feb VAT and Feb PAYE) have already been warehoused at 0% interest for almost 12 months.  Where such businesses do not resume trading until April 2021, these liabilities may be warehoused at 0% interest for a period of 28 months in total (from March 2020 until June 2022).

For this reason, modified Gross National Income (or GNI*), which excludes some of the statistical distortions arising from the multinational sector, enables a more meaningful measure of the size of the Irish economy. The letter also uses Actual Individual Consumption, which refers to all goods and services actually consumed by households. While this indicator is a useful guide for economic welfare, international comparisons can be challenging because of the difficulties in comparing the quality of different countries goods and services as well as differing savings rates among countries. <\/p>  <p>  Professor Honohan&rsquo;s letter indicates that if we use GDP per capita in 2019, Ireland was ranked in second place in the EU, behind only Luxembourg.

This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians and the valuable insights gained. This new scheme is aimed at commercial venues, producers and promoters in the culture sector and will support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and continued high quality artistic output for the general public. Grant recipients of the pilot LPSS may apply under this new scheme. The scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. The Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 will be open for applications on 19th March 2021 and further information can be found on my Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million will also be made available to local authorities for outdoor live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.  <\/p>  <p>  As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for a new scheme to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000. <\/p>  <p>  Self-employed businesses whether sole traders, partnerships and incorporated entities operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.

These figures do not include homes which were returned to productive use by Dublin City Council using funding from its own resources.<\/p><p>Requests for funding for 2021 are currently awaited from local authorities by my Department. The table attached sets out the funding provided to Dublin city Council as requested. <\/p><p><ahref=\"https:\/\/data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2021-03-10_pq397-10-03-21_en.docx\">SSHA<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000088#WRQ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Rates","counter":1008,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000088#WRQ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1009,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[13127\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000088#WRQ04500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will consider extending the current waiver on local authority commercial rates for tourism and hospitality businesses until the end of 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 218 fire stations nationwide.<\/p><p>Over the course of 2014\/2015, an External Validation Group (EVG), commissioned by the Management Board of the NDFEM, visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation process arising from implementation of the &quot;Keeping Communities Safe&quot; national policy document. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;.  The findings of that process are available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p>This first EVG report was a welcome benchmark of local authority provision of fire services in Ireland, and reviewed a number of themes. For the first time, it reported on the matching of provision of fire services with assessed fire risk. It reviewed fire safety work and undertook an assessment of the impact of national guidance on safety, health and welfare of staff in fire services. The Report concluded that the public are served well by the locally authority provided fire service arrangements and can retain confidence in the integrity and professionalism of those with responsibility for managing and delivering fire safety and fire services in Ireland. <\/p><p>In May 2019, the Management Board of NDFEM considered a proposal for a second round of external validation, or EVG II. Stakeholder engagement was undertaken in preparation for a thematic review process, which was scheduled to commence in Q1 2020. However, due to Covid-19, the Board made a decision to postpone this process. <\/p><p>As an alternative, the Board mandated staff in the NDFEM to undertake a review of the impact of Covid-19 on local authority fire service resilience and response, as well as on fire safety work and to look at fire services roles in supporting Covid-related emergency management. The objective was to capture  issues arising, lessons to be learned and good practice which worked during the first phase of Covid-19 response, so that essential services could continue to be maintained in case of further surges. <\/p><p>This review was undertaken by means of &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; (i.e. by Webex link) to each of the 27 fire services and three Regional Communications Centres. This &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; process was undertaken by an NDFEM team, working in association with Chief Fire Officers and their staff and local authority executives. These visits were undertaken between the 24th of June and the 22nd of September 2020.  A composite report on themes related to the impact of Covid-19 on fire services was compiled and presented to the NDFEM Management Board in October 2020.<\/p><p>The position in relation to undertaking an EVG II will be kept under review by the NDFEM Management Board, taking account of the  virtual experience of the response and resilience study and in light of the evolving Covid-19 situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000089#WRR03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1067,"content":"<p>Question No. 420 answered with Question No. 379.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising","counter":1068,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000089#WRR03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1069,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[13562\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000089#WRR03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount spent across his Department on advertising in relation to Covid-19 by month and by media outlet (details supplied) from 1 March 2020 to 1 March 2021.","asker":"1619","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1070,"content":"<p>My Department has not incurred any expenditure on advertising in national newspapers, regional newspapers, national radio, regional and local radio stations and across social media platforms on COVID-19 awareness raising campaigns.<\/p>  <p>  However, in 2020, my Department spent &euro;192,907 on public information material as part of the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Last week I launched Ireland's Climate Finance Report for 2019, which set the baseline for that commitment.<\/p><p>While COVID-19 rolls back development gains around the world, the Irish Aid programme has proved its self well positioned to respond.  Through country programmes in Africa, Ireland is supporting the strengthening of public health systems, amplified by Irish Aid's investment this year of &euro;50 million in global public health, including COVAX which will see vaccines distributed to 90 lower and middle income countries.  Ireland is also a member of the Team Europe response to the pandemic - the EU and its Member States are already supporting the vaccination of 20% of the world's population through COVAX, and this is likely to grow.  My Department works closely with the HSE in its work on global health, including in the provision of mental health support to frontline workers in COVID-affected partner countries.<\/p><p>With approximately 35% of Official Development Aid generated by other Departments, coordination across Government has been strengthened over the past two years.  In addition, the capacity to manage programmes, particularly in key thematic areas such as climate, food and health, as well as oversight, is being strengthened, building from a strong base as identified by the OECD's review of Irish Aid published last year.  <\/p><p>Work is ongoing to increase investment in research, and improve our public engagement.  In this regard, I am currently engaged in a public consultation towards a new strategy on development education, for finalisation this summer.  <\/p><p>Taken together these steps will ensure that Irish Aid is fit for purpose as we implement A Better World over the next decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"question","counter":1142,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[13362\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way the Irish embassy in Ethiopia is delivering the Irish Aid programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1143,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, launched in February 2019, commits to scaling Ireland&rsquo;s investment across four policy priorities: gender equality; reducing humanitarian need; climate action and strengthening governance. <\/p>  <p>  This policy was complemented, in November 2019, by the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Africa to 2025, which builds on Ireland&rsquo;s long history of engagement in the continent and commits to working with African countries in their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on reaching those furthest behind first.

Investments in development began from a very low base and today Mozambique remains one the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, with access to basic services such as water, healthcare and education still challenging. <\/p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in Mozambique aims to make a distinctive and principled foreign policy contribution that includes managing the delivery of the Irish Aid programme. A key objective of the programme is to improve access to quality health and education services &ndash; both critical tasks as Mozambique faces the continuing spread of COVID-19. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy is working at both political and technical levels in support of the Government of Mozambique&rsquo;s COVID-19 response. In 2020, Ireland made an advance disbursement of funding for Mozambique&rsquo;s health sector pooled fund, amounting to &euro;8 million, and worked with the Ministry of Health to reprioritise donor expenditure in order to procure PPE and to support the recruitment of auxiliary health workers to provide surge capacity in the health system. Ireland&rsquo;s support was critical in ensuring that front line staff were in place to manage the impacts of COVID-19 and that essential health services to the poor, particularly to women, children and vulnerable groups could continue. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s support to the education sector in Mozambique was also adapted in 2020 in light of COVID-19. As all schools were closed in March, Ireland worked with the Ministry of Education to reprioritise expenditure to support an adapted learning environment, including the provision of virtual classes via television and radio platforms, while also supporting teacher training and preparations for the resumption of primary and secondary education. <\/p><p>Reducing humanitarian need is another key element of Ireland&rsquo;s work. In March and April 2019, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused widespread devastation to infrastructure and crops, displaced 400,000 people from their homes, and left more than 2 million people in urgent humanitarian need. In response, Ireland provided just over &euro;4 million to UN and NGO partners. These funds enabled the delivery of lifesaving food assistance, health care, and access to water, sanitation and hygiene to impacted families, and later, provided those displaced with supports to return to their homes. The Embassy&rsquo;s partnerships with Government health, education, and disaster management agencies also contributed to an effective response to the outbreak of cholera following the cyclones, the rehabilitation of schools and hospitals using climate-resilient construction techniques, and to overall coordination of emergency response efforts.<\/p><p>In northern Mozambique, where a violent insurgency has been underway since 2017, Ireland is at the forefront of humanitarian response efforts to meet the needs of more than 660,000 people displaced from their homes by violence, and more than 950,000 facing emergency levels of food insecurity. In 2020, Ireland provided &euro;4.8 million euro to UN, NGO and Red Cross partners working to meet humanitarian needs. This included &euro;2.2 million to the World Food Programme in support of its efforts to provide emergency food assistance to those displaced, and &euro;700,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for work to uphold humanitarian law in conflict-affected areas, to support victims of violence, and to provide those displaced with access to health services, water and sanitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"question","counter":1157,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[13367\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS05700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way that the Irish embassy in Sierra Leone is delivering the Irish Aid programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1158,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, launched in February 2019, commits to scaling Ireland&rsquo;s investment across four policy priorities: gender equality; reducing humanitarian need; climate action and strengthening governance. <\/p>  <p>  This policy was complemented, in November 2019, by the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Africa to 2025, which builds on Ireland&rsquo;s long history of engagement in the continent and commits to working with African countries in their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on reaching those furthest behind first.

Irish Aid programmes focus on education, maternal and child health, human rights and accountability, and tackling Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Since 2020, the Embassy and its partners have also been working to address the impacts of Covid-19. <\/p><p>Gender equality is at the centre of the full range of the Embassy&rsquo;s work. Addressing harmful gender norms, violence, and promoting women&rsquo;s participation in society are core elements of Irish Aid&rsquo;s work, which comprises two streams: at national level, supports to UN and civil society partners aim to influence policy and national processes which address gender equality. At community level, direct interventions support women and children affected by violence and work with men and boys to reduce the incidence of violence. <\/p><p>In South Africa, where GBV is endemic, Ireland has supported the development and roll-out of a National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide. The Embassy&rsquo;s work also supports research and community-level engagement with men and boys to encourage behaviour change. In Zimbabwe, the Embassy has worked with UNFPA to lobby for the review of laws and policies to prevent child marriage, and to hold perpetrators of intimate partner violence to account, while civil society organisations supported by the Embassy run shelters and provide access to essential services for survivors of GBV. At regional level, the Embassy supports UN Women&rsquo;s multi-country office for South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Botswana, and Namibia, to implement the Southern African Development Community&rsquo;s (SADC) Framework for Action on GBV. <\/p><p>In South Africa, the Embassy&rsquo;s flagship education programme is the Kader Asmal Fellowship Programme, named in honour of the late Professor Kader Asmal who taught at Trinity College Dublin, co-founded the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was part of the team that negotiated South Africa&rsquo;s transition to democracy. Through this programme, Ireland supports students from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Lesotho to study at Master&rsquo;s degree level in Ireland in strategically important disciplines. 81 Fellowships have been awarded since the programme commenced in 2013, and 14 South Africans were offered fellowships for the 2020\/21 academic year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"question","counter":1163,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[13369\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS06300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way that the Irish embassy in Tanzania is delivering the Irish Aid programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1164,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s policy for international development, &lsquo;<i>A Better World<\/i>&rsquo;, launched in February 2019, commits to scaling Ireland&rsquo;s investment across four policy priorities: gender equality; reducing humanitarian need; climate action and strengthening governance. <\/p><p>This policy was complemented, in November 2019, by the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Africa to 2025, which builds on Ireland&rsquo;s long history of engagement in the continent and commits to working with African countries in their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on reaching those furthest behind first.

In May 2020, an OECD review recognised the excellence of Irish Aid, Ireland&rsquo;s international development programme, which helps Ireland play a leading role advocating for poverty reduction, channelling our assistance to where it is needed most.<\/p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Uganda opened in 1994, with the establishment of the Irish Aid programme in the country. Guided by the priorities of &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, Ireland&rsquo;s focus on the most vulnerable sections of society has been consistent, including through the longstanding prioritisation of the poorest and most marginalised region of Uganda, Karamoja. Ireland&rsquo;s engagement is recognised for its strong focus on girls&rsquo; education, HIV prevention, and support of social welfare grants for senior citizens. This focus remains highly relevant in providing targeted support to those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Embassy and its partners will continue to address the impacts of COVID-19 through its programming in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has played a key role in supporting an expanded social protection programme in Uganda. A critical component of this programme is the provision of social welfare payments to senior citizens. Ireland&rsquo;s support has helped provide cash transfers and reduce vulnerability of elderly people and their families. This has improved the quality of life across many households, through supporting improved diets as well as increased access to basic health care and education for children. It has also provided opportunities for households to engage in small enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  Improving access to education is a key priority of Ireland&rsquo;s investment in Uganda. In Karamoja, where education and literacy indicators are the lowest in the country, Ireland supports primary and post primary education, vocational training and skills development, as well as bursaries for the most vulnerable students. Support for strengthened governance also remains an important area of focus, and Ireland has worked closely with the EU and other EU Member State partners through the flagship Democratic Governance Facility (DGF), which provides coordinated support to over ninety organisations working to promote democratic governance and human rights. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of its progressive open-door refugee policy, Uganda hosts approximately 1.4 million refugees, the largest refugee population in Africa. The needs of this population are greater than ever, with refugee settlements facing increased food insecurity and risk of malnutrition due to financial constraints. The situation has been compounded further by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, Ireland has increased our support for cash transfers, food assistance and provision of basic services to refugees. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"question","counter":1169,"qnumday":456,"qnumall":"[13371\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000090#WRS06900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way that the Irish embassy in Vietnam is delivering the Irish Aid programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1170,"content":"<p>Ireland's longstanding programme of development cooperation in South East Asia is implemented by the Embassy of Ireland in Hanoi in conjunction with a number of partner organisations.

The populations and geographical areas targeted by the Ethnic Minorities Programme include more than half of those living in poverty in Vietnam. Irish Aid supports the Vietnamese Government in implementing the programme in five provinces, with a focus on small-scale infrastructure (local roads, schools, clinics, etc.).

The Strategy set out a multi-strand approach to deepening Ireland&rsquo;s relationships with SIDS, building on diplomatic, bilateral, multilateral, and international development links, and fostering closer bonds between our peoples. A partnership approach has been central to the formulation and ongoing implementation of the Strategy, with SIDS consulted regularly to ensure it is relevant to their priorities. <\/p><p>The Strategy is grounded in the ambition set out in <i>The Global Island<\/i>and <i>Global Ireland<\/i>to expand our influence and also reflects the commitment in <i>A Better World <\/i>to strengthen our relationship with SIDS, especially those most vulnerable to climate impact, and to support initiatives which respond to the specific challenges they face. Most recently, the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future &ndash; reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to deepen its relationship with SIDS. <\/p><p>The SIDS&rsquo; Strategy contains 36 commitments, of which 32 have been fully or partially implemented.

An early example was a dialogue between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and SIDS&rsquo; representatives at the Our Ocean Wealth conference in Cork in 2019. In addition, a regular cycle of meetings has been developed between the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, T.D. and his Caribbean counterparts at the World Bank\/IMF Spring and Annual Meetings in Washington DC. This is particularly relevant given that Ireland shares a World Bank Constituency with the Caribbean States.  <\/p><p>- Irish support for the SAMOA pathway within the UN, which aims to ensure SIDS-related issues remain high on the UN agenda and to support sustainable development in SIDS - not least by mitigating the effects of climate change. The mid-term review of the process was co-facilitated by Ireland's Ambassador to the UN in New York, Ambassador Geraldine Byrne-Nason, with President Higgins addressing a SIDS&rsquo; Summit at the UN. In 2020 Ireland funded the recruitment of an expert to work on SIDS issues within the UN Secretariat.  <\/p><p>In addition to these measures, in 2020 my Department undertook its first-ever SIDS-specific humanitarian response, working through the International Federation of the Red Cross and Asian Development Bank in the area of pandemic preparedness and education in SIDS.

He has condemned reported atrocities and identity-based attacks, and has called for the human rights of all Ethiopians to be upheld.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, through Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;2.6 million to date to support the humanitarian response to the Tigray crisis. This includes &euro;1.4 million to Irish NGOs within Tigray, &euro;500,000 to the UN refugee agency to support the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, and almost &euro;750,000 towards humanitarian stocks, and supports for the protection of women and girls. <\/p>  <p>  Unrest in other parts of Ethiopia,  including Oromia Region and Benshangul-Gumuz, is also of concern.  The Embassy of Ireland in Addis Ababa continues to monitor these situations closely in cooperation with our EU and UN partners.  <\/p>  <p>  Ethiopia will hold general elections on 5 June.  Ireland looks forward to free, fair and inclusive elections on that date.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000091#WRT02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising","counter":1196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000091#WRT02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1197,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[13559\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000091#WRT02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount spent across his Department on advertising relating to Covid-19 by month and by media outlet (details supplied) from 1 March 2020 to 1 March 2021.","asker":"1619","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1198,"content":"<p>My Department has incurred no expenditure on external advertising in relation to Covid-19.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.  The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs.  A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme.  The main purpose of the programme was to provide professional development and not the provision of a qualification.  Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  <\/p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period.  Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.<\/p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. <\/p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  <\/p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.  I look forward to its development.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new training programme for SNAs now in place is of high quality and will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000092#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":1255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000092#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1256,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[12540\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000092#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school place can be provided in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1257,"content":"<p>In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 .

Since Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.  <\/p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future.  As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.  <\/p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools earlier last year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period.  Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  <\/p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074\/2020, &lsquo;Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication\/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.<\/p><p>The Circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes. <\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education<\/i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers<\/i>. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.

This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service in my Department, to support students.

They are underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour and the need for such incidents to be recorded. <\/p><p>The guidelines when issued will apply to all schools.

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.<\/p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs. <\/p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions. <\/p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at .<\/p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.<\/p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.<\/p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.<\/p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.<\/p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school, including those children who have ADHD, Dyslexia, or Dispraxia, can therefore receive additional teaching support in schools, without a requirement for them to have a formal assessment of need.<\/p><p>I can also advise that an Education Passport has been devised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) which includes a suite of materials to support the reporting and transfer of pupil information from primary to post-primary schools.<\/p><p>An Education Passport, for each pupil, should be sent to the relevant post-primary school following confirmation of enrolment and, ideally, by the end of June.  Since 2014\/15, schools are required to use the NCCA Education Passport materials to support the reporting and transfer of pupil information at the end of sixth class. The materials are presented under the umbrella title of &ldquo;Education Passport&rdquo; <\/p><p>The &lsquo;Education Passport' is a compulsory requirement for all 6th class pupils in their transition from Primary to Post-Primary School.<\/p><p>Details of the Education passport are available at: <i> <\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000093#WRV05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000093#WRV05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":524,"qnumall":"[13065\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000093#WRV05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the wearing of masks and antigen testing will be brought into primary schools for children and teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1374,"content":"<p>My Department has always been guided by public health advice in relation to the infection prevention and control measure appropriate for schools.

All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when a teacher suffers from more than one health condition.  The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  A teacher is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are &lsquo;Normal Risk&rsquo;, High Risk&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo;. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the latest HSE guidance.My Department is following the same guidance that is in use across the public sector.

This may include re-assignment of a teacher to other duties within the school or facilitated to work remotely i.e. working from home.  When schools fully re-open, these flexible working arrangements will no longer be available and therefore a teacher in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; group who is medically fit for work must return to the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000093#WRV06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1381,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000093#WRV06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1382,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[13068\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000093#WRV06300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 465 of 27 January 2021, her views on whether the Framework of Design and Build Contractors to ensure the tendering and appointment of a contractor for the construction of schools (details supplied) will be in place before the projected timeframe of the end of the first quarter of 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1383,"content":"<p>The building project referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme and planning permission has been secured for the campus project.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of establishing a Framework of Design and Build Contractors to which Design and Build projects can be tendered.

It notes recent research on the topic, and reflects the experience of a number of voluntary groups working with people experiencing poverty and deprivation. This is a interesting report in the context  of the work my Department is undertaking to address social inclusion under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025.<\/p><p>This Roadmap for Social Inclusion which was published in January 2020, is the Government's strategy to address poverty and social inclusion in Ireland. It sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition to reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2025 and to make Ireland one of the most socially inclusive states in the EU. The aim of the Roadmap is to achieve this ambitious target by  delivering 66  commitments across Government Departments. In the context of the &lsquo;Hungry bellies&rsquo; report, it is important to note that the Roadmap looks beyond income as the only measure of addressing exclusion or inequality. The Programme for Government includes a commitment for the implementation of the Roadmap.  As Minister of State with responsibility for social inclusion, I am the Chair of the Social Inclusion Roadmap Steering Group, which oversees the implementation of the Roadmap across Government and monitors its progress. This group met for the first time in November 2020 and is due to meet again on 30th March.<\/p><p>The Roadmap contains a range of targets based on data collected as part of the annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), the official source of data on household and equivalised disposable income in Ireland, undertaken by the CSO.  It provides a number of key national poverty indicators, including the &lsquo;at risk of poverty rate&rsquo;, the &lsquo;consistent poverty rate&rsquo; and the &lsquo;enforced deprivation rate&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<i>Hungry Bellies<\/i>&rsquo; report refers to the most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data from 2019 which was published in late 2020. This data reflects income and living conditions in Ireland in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic.  The SILC data for 2020, which will reflect the impact of Covid-19, is unlikely to be available until Q4 2021.  <\/p><p>The 2019 SILC data showed that basic deprivation (which measures the percentage of the population experiencing enforced deprivation) had increased from 15.1% in 2018 to 17.8% in 2019. However the At-Risk-of-Poverty rate, which measures the percentage of the population experiencing relative income poverty, had fallen from 14.0% to 12.8% in the same period.  The consistent poverty rate, which measures the percentage of the population who are both at risk of poverty and experiencing deprivation, decreased slightly to 5.5% in 2019, from the 2018 rate of 5.6%.  Information on the Survey on Income and Living Conditions is available at: <\/p><p>It is reasonable to expect that the 2020 SILC data will reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on household incomes.  However this impact is likely to be lessened to some degree by the introduction by Government of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme.  Research by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), as part of their Budget Perspectives series in 2020, highlighted the importance of the social protection system for supporting those on low-incomes in general and the role of pandemic supports in &lsquo;cushioning&rsquo; the impact of the unemployment shock related to the pandemic, with the drop in income resulting from pandemic-related unemployment softened by the pandemic income supports.  <\/p><p>In addition, Budget 2021 included a range of targeted social welfare measures to assist low income families and households, including an increase in the weekly fuel allowance rate; increases to the qualified child rates for children under and over 12 years of age; an increase in the living alone allowance as well as increases to the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment and to the income disregard for the Disability Allowance. These measures will contribute to the ongoing support to low income households provided by the social protection system.<\/p><p>I thank the Deputy for her question and hope this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000095#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000095#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[12551\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000095#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if flexibility can be afforded to freelance and short-term workers with regard to eligibility for the pandemic unemployment payment in recognition of the disruptive financial impact of Covid-19 on employees on short-term annual contracts who are often not covered by the payment eligibility criteria; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1488,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is available to employees and self-employed persons who have lost employment as a direct consequence of COVID-19.

The payment is made for a defined maximum period for each of the two situations listed.

These issues are being considered from a perspective of fiscal and social sustainability, and intergenerational fairness.  It has held eight meetings to date and will report on its findings by the end of June 2021.  In this regard, the Commission is halfway through its work. <\/p><p>Membership of the Commission includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  This includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  The ICTU nomination on the Commission is a senior representative from SIPTU, a founding member of the Stop 67 coalition, and a member of the Executive Board of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  I was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female representation in its membership, and I am pleased that the majority of members &ndash; 7 out of 11 &ndash; are women.  It is imperative that the Commission has the required expertise to progress its work and is independent in its deliberations.<\/p><p>As part of its work, the Commission has been asked to seek the views of recognised experts and representative groups by inviting submissions and presentations. Details on the Commission's work is available on its website, PensionsCommission.gov.ie. The Commission&rsquo;s public consultation process closed just this week on the 9th of March.  It sought submissions by email or by post from interested parties on sustainable State Pensions arrangements into the future.  There was also a survey for those who did not wish to make a formal submission. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, is well equipped to grasp the potential impacts of any pensions reform options on affected groups, such as women, workers, and older people.  It is of particular importance to consider the impact of any potential changes to the State Pension system on those who rely on it for all or most of their income.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000096#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance","counter":1557,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000096#WRY01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1558,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[12916\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000096#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the expected timeframe for a decision to be made on an application for the disability allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

I note that the paper considers a number of issues concerning self-employed workers, and groups these into the four policy areas of: the social insurance contributions made by self-employed workers;  the social protection supports provided to them; the differentiation between employed and self-employed workers; and representation for self-employed workers.<\/p><p>With respect to the level of contribution to the social insurance fund by self-employed workers, they are now covered for most of the benefits available under the social insurance scheme which represents approximately 93% of the value of all benefits paid by the social insurance fund - in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than that made in respect of employed contributors.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government includes a commitment that consideration will be given to increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed and the NESC paper will inform my Department's consideration in that regard.<\/p><p>The second issue relates to the levels of welfare support provided to self-employed workers.  My Department offers a range of income supports to self-employed people, including -<\/p><p>- jobseeker's benefit (self-employed),<\/p><p>- the option of applying for a means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance instead depending on their personal circumstances,<\/p><p>- the pandemic unemployment payment,<\/p><p>- facilitating self-employed workers who are in receipt of  the pandemic unemployment payment and who are seeking to maintain their business, to earn up to &euro;960 over an eight week period while maintaining their full payment entitlement,<\/p><p>- the enhanced illness benefit payment of &euro;350 per week where they have been medically diagnosed with COVID or have been medically advised to self-isolate or restrict their movements,<\/p><p>- the back to work enterprise allowance scheme which offers support to people who are long-term unemployed and who are interested in self-employment as a route to entering the labour market - this allowance is payable to self-employed workers for up to a 24-month period from the commencement of their new business,<\/p><p>- the once-off enterprise support grant of up to &euro;1,000 to assist with the costs associated with reopening a business following the imposition of Covid-related restrictions, and<\/p><p>- my Department's employment support services on a voluntary basis through their local Intreo Centre.<\/p><p>With respect to the categorisation of self-employed workers matter, my Department&rsquo;s social welfare inspectorate carry out, as part of their duties, employer investigations to ensure compliance with social insurance law and employment status investigations form part of this work. The approach to addressing potential false self-employment includes the setting up of a new team of inspectors in late 2019 to focus entirely on detecting and investigating such practices.  In recognising the need to increase awareness in this area, my Department is leading an interdepartmental group on updating and revising the important &lsquo;<i>Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment<\/i>&rsquo;.  In consultation with other departments and the social partners, I expect this revised Code to be published in the coming months.<\/p><p>Finally, in the area of representation, industrial relations in Ireland rests on a voluntary model.

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The State Pension Contributory (SPC) is a contributory payment and, as such, is not means tested. A recipient of the SPC can claim an increase to their pension in respect of a qualified adult (IQA).  A qualified adult is the spouse \/ partner of the pensioner who is being wholly or mainly maintained by the pensioner. <\/p>  <p>  An increase for a qualified adult may be payable at the maximum rate of payment where the means of the spouse\/partner are &euro;100 a week or less, while reduced rates are payable where the means are over &euro;100 and less than &euro;310 per week.  No increase is payable where the means of the spouse\/partner are in excess of &euro;310 per week.  <\/p>  <p>  The State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC) is a means-tested payment for people aged 66 or over who do not qualify for the SPC based on their social insurance record. <\/p>  <p>  As such, all recipients of the SPNC are subject to a means test. Social welfare legislation provides that all income and capital belonging to an applicant (and his or her spouse\/partner, where applicable) is assessable for means testing purposes for social assistance schemes, such as the State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC).  This includes all income and property (other than the family home) belonging to the claimant.  <\/p>  <p>  To calculate the rate payable, the means of the claimant is deducted from the maximum rate of SPNC.

The overarching objective in developing the terms of reference was to establish a Commission capable of providing a full account of what happened in these institutions over the period 1922-1998. <\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference were focused on a combination of four distinct factors:<\/p>  <p>- Clarifying that the intended focus is on single women and children being accommodated for the purpose of receiving extended and supervised maternity and infant care services in Mother and Baby Homes; <\/p>  <p>- Defining the specific issues of public concern as discrete matters to be investigated;<\/p>  <p>- Specifying a list of Mother and Baby Homes and, in addition, providing for examination of equivalent experiences within the network of County Homes;<\/p>  <p>- Defining the relevant period as being from 1922 to 1998, while allowing the Commission to reduce the &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; in respect of any component part or institution if it considers it appropriate to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the approach taken provided for the intended clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in Mother and Baby Homes. <\/p>  <p>  In examining the exit pathways of children, the Commission was required to investigate the nature of the relationship between Mother and Baby Homes and other key institutions &ndash; these included children&rsquo;s homes; orphanages; and adoption societies. This involved the identification of patterns of referral and the practices and arrangements for the placement of children. It also included where an intermediary organisation was involved in arranging a subsequent placement.  <\/p>  <p>  The examination was also to identify the extent to which children&rsquo;s welfare and best interests were considered in making arrangements for their placement both here in Ireland and abroad. The Commission was further asked to identify the extent of mothers&rsquo; participation in such decisions, including procedures around mothers&rsquo; consent, and the extent to which these procedures were sufficient to ensure that consent was full, free and informed. The Commission was therefore provided with sufficient scope to examine the placing of children for adoption at home and abroad, as well as to examine situations in which the child&rsquo;s parentage was concealed, either by omission or sometimes, by illegal means.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s final Report addresses important questions in relation to the practices in place during the period under investigation. The Commission was able to cross-reference information from the institutional records, State records, testimony from witnesses and evidence from other sources. <\/p>  <p>  It is accepted by all parties that, in the past, the arrangements for the placement of children often involved secretive practices, carried out without due regard to the rights of those involved. Such practices reflected wider societal prejudices of the time. Today, the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases, and in every step of the process. <\/p>  <p>  Separate to the work of the Commission, I have just published an independent review report into incorrect birth registrations. This independent report was commissioned following Tulsa's discovery in early 2018 of evidence of illegal birth registrations in the files of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild adoption society. <\/p>  <p>  While this review was unable to identify a unique marker suggestive of illegal birth registration in the sampled files I know significant concerns remain about the practice of illegal birth registrations. For that reason, I have asked the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection to consider the very significant complexities and challenges, including the deep ethical issues, which arise in relation to the issue of illegal birth registrations, and to propose an appropriate course of action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000097#WRZ06275","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care","counter":1689,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000097#WRZ06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1690,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[12485\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000097#WRZ06400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the situation in respect of insurance cover for foster children, particularly in regard to farm accidents, given foster children are not deemed by insurance policies to be family or a visitor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1691,"content":"<p>The National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) Order (S.I No. 571 of 2019)  was made in November 2019.

Annual investment in early learning and childcare has increased by 141% since 2015. This funding has been directed towards improving accessibility, quality and affordability. It has, for example, funded a second year of the free pre-school programme and enabled the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).<\/p><p>The Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE) programme is a universal two-year pre-school programme available to all children within the eligible age range without cost to parents. The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks per year and the programme year runs from September to June each year. Approximately 95% of children participate in the programme prior to commencing primary school.<\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme was introduced in November 2019. It offers a statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare. It establishes an equitable and progressive system of universal and income-related subsidies for children up to the age of 15. The NCS derives from the Childcare Support Act 2018 which is the first piece of primary legislation passed in Ireland specifically relating to childcare. The Scheme aims to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, and tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families.<\/p><p>NCS subsidies are awarded as an hourly rate for a maximum number of hours per week. The maximum number of subsidised hours available to families has increased from September 2020. Parents in work, study or training can now avail of up to 45 subsidised hours of childcare per week. Parents not in work, study or training can avail of up to 20 subsidised hours of childcare per week. The Scheme comprises two types of subsidies:<\/p><p><b>- Universal Subsidy: <\/b>All families with children under 3 in registered childcare, or children who are over 3 and have not yet qualified for the free preschool (ECCE) programme, can apply. This subsidy is not means tested, and provides up to &euro;20 per week, or &euro;1,040 per year, off the cost of a registered childcare place.<\/p><p><b>- Income Assessed:<\/b>Families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years who are attending registered childcare and who have a reckonable household income (NET) of less than &euro;60,000 can apply for an Income Assessed subsidy. Subsidy rates are tailored based on individual circumstances, such as reckonable family income, child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. The highest subsidy rate is &euro;5.10 per hour for a baby living in a family with a household income of less than &euro;26,000 per year, or &euro;229 per week. The maximum subsidy for a school age child is &euro;3.75 per hour per week.<\/p><p>More information on the NCS is available to parents by contacting the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday 9am-5pm, or on-line at www.ncs.gov.ie.<\/p><p>First 5, the whole-of Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, has committed to a doubling of investment in early learning and childcare in the decade to 2028. In the context of this increased investment, a key project to address affordability is the development of a new funding model. An Expert Group is leading on this work.<\/p><p>Extensive research has already been commissioned to inform the Expert Group's work. The Research Partner, Frontier Economics, have so far produced and published five working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues entitled: &ldquo;International Comparisons of Fees, Staff Wages and Public Investment in Early Learning and Care&rdquo;; &ldquo;International Approaches to Funding Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to Reduce Costs for Parents&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Mechanisms to Control Fees Charged to Parents for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare&rdquo;.  The research identifies international practice and learning that will be of value for the reform of the funding model in Ireland.<\/p><p>The recommendations of the Expert Group will be made in Autumn 2021 and will set out how the additional funding pledged in First 5 can deliver optimally for children, families and the State.

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely. <\/p>  <p>  From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:<\/p>  <p>  - teaching and learning, <\/p>  <p>  - assessment, and <\/p>  <p>  - qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. <\/p>  <p>  Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers at a local and regional level. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that, where possible, necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. <\/p>  <p>  While I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by CORU, QQI and our educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point, I am conscious that further efforts are now necessary. <\/p>  <p>  The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created even greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements.

These engagements are ongoing and are focused on identifying solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes.

We published our Statement of Strategy for the 2021-2023 period on March 8. It contains six strategic goals including a goal on inclusion which seeks to &ldquo;support learning for all, recognising the needs of vulnerable learners and the most marginalised, and assist people in access to and progression through higher and further education and training, so as to grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The Further Education and Training (FET) sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including those with a disability. FET programmes are available to all learners, including those with an intellectual disability, who meet the eligibility criteria and the guidelines provided for each FET programme. <\/p><p>Specialist Training Provision (STP) is also available for learners with more complex support needs, and this provision addresses the identified training needs of people with disabilities who are experiencing exclusion and labour market disadvantage in the form of vocational training programmes. Community Education assists learners with a disability to participate in FET provision by adapting course content, resources and teaching methodologies to suit their abilities. <\/p><p>FET providers are required to offer reasonable accommodations to learners with disabilities, the nature of these accommodations varies depending on the identified needs of individual learners. FET provision is available across the country in every county. Most of these programmes are either free of charge or heavily subsidised. Details of FET courses are available at <i>www.fetchcourses.ie<\/i>or through the Adult Education Guidance Service in the learner&rsquo;s local ETB. This service is free of charge and open to anyone over the age of 18. Local ETBs can provide advice on all education and training options, as well as additional supports that are available to learners, including for learners with a disability. <\/p><p>SOLAS, the national Further Education and Training authority is currently overseeing an independent evaluation of SPT. The purpose of the evaluation is to examine the quality, effectiveness, on-going relevance and overall value of vocational training that is currently delivered by specialist training providers, and to propose any recommendations for future practice.<\/p><p>Students who meet eligibility criteria and are attending approved courses can access supports such as the SUSI grant scheme. The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) is the principal funding source for students with disabilities in further and higher education. The fund is available to students with disabilities, including Autism, attending both further and higher education courses. Students attending approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK, and the EU are also eligible for support.  The purpose of the FSD is to provide students with a disability with the necessary assistance to enable them to access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. <\/p><p>I recently approved a number of initiatives under the FSD aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development.

I am aware of the important contribution made by this sector and of the challenges that are being encountered given the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on students, teachers and providers.<\/p><p>As part of the response to the pandemic, my Department established a specific Working Group for this sector. This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments and sectorial representatives of staff, students and providers. <\/p><p>As part of this process, the representative bodies for English language education providers have engaged with the Working Group surrounding their proposals for supports to aid the recovery of this sector. In this forum, the providers have been advised of the measures introduced by Government, as part of the wider Covid-19 response, to support businesses at this time. These measures included the temporary wages subsidy scheme (TWSS) to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis. This temporary scheme was expected to be in place for an initial 12-week period. However, recognising the circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, the Government agreed that the TWSS would remain in place until the end of August 2020. Following the conclusion of the TWSS, it has been superseded by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which continues to provide payroll support to businesses. In addition to the subsidy that is being provided via the EWSS, this scheme also provides for a reduction in Employers PRSI. <\/p><p>Further to the above, the ELE provider representatives have been advised of the eligibility of businesses in this sector to apply, where appropriate, for further business supports made available by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices.

For the 2020\/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. <\/p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations for the 2021\/22 academic year will be published towards the end of March\/early April 2021. The opening of SUSI's online grant application system will coincide with the publication of the scheme. Grant applications are submitted online via www.susi.ie. Further information in relation to student grant assistance is also available from this website. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. <\/p>  <p>  A review of the Student Grant Scheme in 2020 (following the impact of COVID-19) was committed to as part of the Programme for Government.

This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.

The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN) to respond to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation, has been implemented on a national level since 2013.<\/p><p>I am informed that funding in Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), North Central Division for Garda Youth Diversion Projects and activities has increased from &euro;566,236 in 2018 to an allocation of &euro;1.2m in 2021. Alongside this increase in funding, the currently funded projects are being provided with increased staffing and support to increase their catchment areas to cover the majority of the DMR, North Central area. This is part of the overall objective of my Department to increase and develop the Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP) network to ensure access to all young people that need the service nationally. <b><\/b><\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the issue of youth crime is addressed in the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026, which I intend to finalise and bring to Government shortly.  This will consider the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system. This will include early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.  <\/p><p>Minister of State James Browne has also established a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour, which will consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that the North Inner City Electoral Area is one of three locations (along with Waterford and Longford) due to pilot the Department&rsquo;s new Local Community Safety Partnership approach. <\/p><p>The Partnerships will bring together residents, community representatives, business interests, councillors, local authorities and State services such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the HSE to devise and implement the Local Community Safety Plans. This approach is aimed at bringing all of the key services together with the communities they serve to jointly identify and tackle the problems facing their particular area. A community &ndash; such as the North Inner City &ndash; often has a range of resources available and the Partnership can act as a means to bring those resources together, and identify and address gaps where necessary. Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; was recently appointed Chair to the Dublin North Inner City partnership. A process of community engagement will commence this month with a view to having the partnership established in April. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000100#WRCC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1855,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000100#WRCC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1856,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[12669\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000100#WRCC02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the visa process for medical professionals who have job offers in health settings here and who are engaging with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service can be expedited given the serious need for medical staff nationally.

While each court of first instance (High, Circuit and District) has used the poor box system on occasion, it is mainly used in the District Court where the judge may order the defendant to pay a donation into the court poor box in lieu of another penalty.  It usually arises where the offence is minor in nature and would not attract a custodial sentence.<\/p>  <p>  Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions, but the decision is solely at the discretion of the judge (who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law).<\/p>  <p>  The Justice Plan 2021, which I published recently, commits to commencing a policy review of the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill 2014 in consultation with the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service. It is intended that the proposed legislation will replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system. The legislation will abolish the Court Poor Box and replace it with a statutory Reparation Fund, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. The fund would provide for a fair, equitable and transparent system of reparation that will apply only to minor offences dealt with by the District Court. I expect to publish a policy review shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000100#WRCC05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":1885,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000100#WRCC05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1886,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[12727\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000100#WRCC05900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of cases that the Meath protective services unit has dealt with since being established.

This commitment was reinforced recently with the highest ever budgetary allocation for the Justice sector including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service. This included &euro;8 million for the new Courts Modernisation Programme along with an additional provision of &euro;5.7m for COVID measures to enable court sittings take place in a socially distanced and safe environment. A significant priority for my Department and the Courts Service in the years ahead will be to significantly invest in digital technology, to transform the experience of practitioners and of court users.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say the Courts have continued to sit on priority matters in the areas of family law, criminal matters (especially cases involving people in custody), bail and urgent injunctions.  Prior to the latest imposition of Level 5 restrictions, additional capacity was added to the courts infrastructure to facilitate the holding of numbers of courts close to pre-Covid levels. While every effort has been made to facilitate as much court business as possible unfortunately significant backlogs have been accrued in regard to certain case categories. The Government endeavours to ensure our courts continue to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible.  My Department is in constant contact with the Courts Service and has maintained a schedule of regular interactions with the Courts Service throughout the pandemic to support the Service in addressing the issues that have arisen during this crisis, including where backlogs have arisen.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions  However, the Courts Service has advised that they continue to work with the Judiciary to prioritise business and the holding of courts to address areas of concern. <\/p><p>The Judiciary and the Courts Service have worked closely to adapt to changed circumstances and innovated through the use of technology to maintain the highest level of activity possible.  This has seen the first remote courts being conducted over video technology as well as an expansion of the use of videolink technology particularly with the Prison Service. This investment and commitment to continuing to serve has enabled the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal to continue with its throughput of cases and supported the other jurisdictions keep many lists up to date. In other jurisdictions, such as the High Court, the increased use of remote technology has led to an increase in cases heard.  Investments continues to be made in these areas to further improve services and the Courts Service is currently rolling out videolink facilities to 43 additional courtrooms across the country and is looking to enhance the infrastructure used in virtual courts. <\/p><p>Further investment is being made in hiring Croke Park to expand courtroom capacity in Dublin and using external venues in order that juries can be empanelled safely for Criminal trials.  These measures are temporarily suspended during the current heightened restrictions but will be recommenced once it is safe to do so. Criminal trials can now take place in an increasing number of trial venues throughout Ireland. Public health guidelines on social distancing initially limited the number of county town courthouses that could hold jury trials but through adaption of courtrooms and the use of technology the number of trial venues has increased from 8 to 16.Criminal trials can now be hosted in the following venues outside Dublin: Carrick On Shannon, Castlebar, Cork, Drogheda, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Limerick, Monaghan, Mullingar, Sligo, Trim, Tullamore, Waterford and Wexford. <\/p><p>The Courts have demonstrated an ability to resume a high level of activity immediately once society begins to reopen.  Through staggering of court lists, positive callovers of cases on hand and the introduction of new people management procedures, Courts began to operate at near full capacity in the summer and autumn of last year and good progress had been made in dealing with arrears that built up during latest period of restrictions.  The Courts Service expect similar results will be possible once current restrictions ease and continue to work closely with the Judiciary to identify areas of work that require particular attention.

I am advised that the Inspectorate will carry out telephone calls to prisons at least every two weeks to take account of the status of the aforementioned Framework Focus Areas. The Inspectorate will also distribute an online survey for prison staff across the prison estate. The objective of the survey will be to gain an understanding of how prison staff are handling challenges associated with COVID-19. These inspection activities will be supplemented by statistical data requested from the Irish Prison Service. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service welcome such oversight and inspection, and in particular the focus of the thematic inspection on Covid-19 which has hugely impacted the services provided over the last year. While the Prison Service has been relatively successful in mitigating against the risks associated with the pandemic and have managed containing infection and outbreak controls, the Prison Service also look forward to the learnings that will be derived from the Inspector's findings and recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000101#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Internships","counter":1913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000101#WRDD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1914,"qnumday":712,"qnumall":"[12959\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000101#WRDD01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of students who undertook work experience or internships with State and semi-State agencies under her aegis in 2019; the cost in terms of wages and allowances; and the estimated numerical capacity of State and semi-State agencies to provide work experience and internships on an annual basis.","asker":"1467","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1915,"content":"<p>It has not been possible to collate the information requested by the Deputy within the time allowed.

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first. <\/p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.<\/p><p>Vaccination of those aged 70 and older (in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74) began in February.<\/p><p>On the 23<sup>rd<\/sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. <\/p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.<\/p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. <\/p><p>In relation to the categories of very high risk and high risk conditions, this list is not exhaustive. It may also include people who have been classed as at very high risk, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of need. It is recommended that people discuss this with their treating physician who is in the best position to give appropriate advice.<\/p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.<\/p><p>Further details are available at the following link:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000102#WREE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":1994,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000102#WREE03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1995,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[12497\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000102#WREE03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding deployment of HSE speech and language therapists as contact tracers;

This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Ivermectin.<\/p><p>Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, the HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. <\/p><p>The HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting to reduce the risk of progression to severe disease in patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 unless as part of an ongoing monitored clinical trial. Furthermore, no evidence was identified for the effectiveness or safety of any non-pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting. <\/p><p>As confirmed by the HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group: (), evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. <\/p><p>The HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. The HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4th February 2021 published a statement including the following: <\/p><p><i>&ldquo;It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified: <\/i><\/p><p><i>- No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

Since services under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in January 2019, there has been a limited number of reports of protests or other actions relating to termination of pregnancy.  This is an extremely positive development, suggesting that termination of pregnancy services have bedded in relatively smoothly to date and are becoming a normal part of the Irish healthcare system, in line with Government policy.<\/p>  <p>  However, where problems do arise with protests outside health care services, there is existing public order legislation in place to protect people accessing services, employees working in the service and local residents. The Department of Health has previously liaised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around safe access to termination of pregnancy services, and the Garda National Protective Services Bureau issued a notice to all Garda Stations raising awareness about the issue.

The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be overstated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. <\/p>  <p>Data indicates that 104 nursing homes are actively dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak.  Noting that on 6th   March approximately 525 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, the level of risk, including to residents of nursing homes remains high.  The public health advice remains clear, as noted in the statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team on 24th February &ldquo;Given the increased transmissibility of the virus now, we must continue to limit our social contacts and do all we can to starve this disease of opportunities to spread&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.  Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  I recently wrote to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the importance of adopting a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the important role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing.  The importance of ensuring that visits take place to the greatest extent possible, in line with public health guidance and risk assessments was reiterated and providers were encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone to calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead, published on 23rd February, recognises that the challenge of balancing protective health measures and normal living has been particularly important in the context of visitations to long-term residential care settings (LTRC). LTRC visiting guidance has remained under ongoing review throughout the pandemic.  In light of the advanced stage of rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in LTRCs for both residents and staff, the NPHET (the National Public Health Emergency Team) has requested that the HSE progress a process for considering the scope and application of LTRC visiting restrictions in the context of the Framework of Restrictive Measures, having regard to international and national evidence, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the level of disease in the community.  The HSE are finalising this process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":2074,"qnumday":769,"qnumall":"[12624\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the basis on which decisions relating to the number of guests at weddings will be revisited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2075,"qnumday":954,"qnumall":"[13430\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the expected number of persons allowed to attend a wedding in June, July and August 2021 taking into account the increase in vaccines and the expected continued decrease of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2076,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 769 and 954 together.<\/p><p>The public health measures in place at any level of the Government's updated plan for managing Covid-19 - COVID-19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead recognise the need to reduce congregation and interactions between people to reduce the transmission of Covid-19.

At the beginning of last week, Ireland had received approximately 520,000 vaccine doses and by the end of the week approximately 500,000 doses were administered, a measure of the programme&rsquo;s efficiency.  Vaccines continue to be administered very quickly after their arrival into the country.  At the moment, vaccine administration is limited only by the supply of approved vaccines and that is dependent on manufacturers meeting their supply commitments.    <\/p>  <p>  As with all Vaccine Administration Sites, consumables (needles, syringes, sharps bin etc.) are delivered separately to vaccines. Planning is predicated on the approach that consumables will be delivered in advance of the vaccine delivery and every effort is made to ensure that this is the case.  However, I am aware of a small number of incidents where consumables have not arrived in advance of the vaccine delivery. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to General Practitioners, the position is that at the conclusion of the first phase roll-out of the programme last weekend, the HSE has confirmed that the majority of patients aged 85 years and over have received their first dose of the vaccine as scheduled. GPs have also begun administration of vaccine to people aged 80-84. In total over 1,300 GP practices, representing in excess of 3,000 GPs and their Practice Teams have delivered over 90,000 vaccines by last weekend and a further 37,000 vaccines being distributed this week (w\/c 8 March). The programme has also involved a number of large-scale GP clinics, which have taken place in the Helix DCU, MTU in Cork and Merlin Park Galway with over 1,500 over 85&rsquo;s receiving the vaccine at these locations.<\/p>  <p>  There are a very small number of practices, less than 30, who are due to receive first delivery this week for their over 85s and it is also intended to commence the vaccination of those who are homebound as arrangements have been put in place in conjunction with GP&rsquo;s, local community teams and the National Ambulance Service and will commence this week and also patients in our acute hospitals.  The HSE has acknowledge that there were problems with communication with GPs generally and that some issues have arisen with the distribution of vaccines to some GP practices over the last week, and steps are being taken to improve this situation also.<\/p>  <p>  As is well known, the vaccination programme is limited internationally by the supply of vaccine and our programme to date has ensured that all available vaccine is distributed and administered as quickly as possible.  The supply required for the completion of the programme by mid-May remains on target.  However, due to a re-profiling of the Moderna vaccine delivery schedule, the total vaccine doses available for distribution in the coming weeks is now slightly less.  The available vaccine supply is approximately 15% less than the required amount to meet the total over-80 cohort.  This means GPs may not receive the total order for these coming weeks but, in all instances, GPs will be advised on the amounts they will receive and any shortfall in vaccine for the over-80 age group will be allocated in the next order and so on through March with a significant ramp-up in vaccine delivery in April as increased supplies arrive in Ireland.  Unfortunately, these supply issues are outside of our control.  However, if any additional supply becomes available, this will be provided to General Practitioners at the earliest opportunity. Importantly, the HSE expects that the totality of the over-70s programme will be completed within the original timeframe of mid-May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2090,"qnumday":773,"qnumall":"[12636\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons who have had their Covid-19 vaccine appointments cancelled to date in 2021.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2091,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2092,"content":"<p>Question No. 774 answered with Question No. 772.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Addiction Treatment Services","counter":2093,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":2094,"qnumday":775,"qnumall":"[12652\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there has been an increase in the amount of young person's seeking treatment for drug addiction in County Kildare since the beginning of March 2020;

The Clinic&rsquo;s Consultant in Infectious Diseases (Gay Men&rsquo;s Health service (GMHS) and GUIDE Clinic, St James&rsquo;s Hospital) and other doctors are providing virtual consultations. PrEP service users attend GMHS for STI screening and blood testing.  Those with diagnosed STIs or requiring Hepatitis and\/or HPV vaccination continue to be treated in GMHS also.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, a phased reintroduction of STI services is currently under way in GMHS.  All services are being and will continue to be delivered in accordance with current Public Health COVID guidelines. Officials from the Department of Health and the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme are in regular contact with CHO6 to monitor progress regarding the phased reopening of the GMHS. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as www.man2man.ie  and www.sexualwellbeing.ie  are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved STI and PrEP services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000103#WRFF07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sexually Transmitted Infections","counter":2113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2114,"qnumday":782,"qnumall":"[12682\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the HIV and STI public testing services that are currently in operation under level 5 Covid-19 restrictions in County Dublin; his plans to restore services which have been suspended due to Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1466","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2115,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented interruptions to normal healthcare activity, with all services affected.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the Department of Health, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.<\/p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for the Minister for Health and further information is available here: <i>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/39038-provisional-vaccine-allocation-groups\/<\/i>. <\/p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. <\/p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.<\/p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.<\/p><p>On the 23<sup>rd<\/sup>of February, Stephen Donnelly TD, Minister for Health announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.<\/p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. <\/p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.<\/p><p>Further details are available at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/b44b2-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-vaccine-allocation-strategy\/<\/i>.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and avoiding non-essential travel, until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.<\/p><p>As the question also pertains to a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly in relation to the individual case, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":2143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2144,"qnumday":792,"qnumall":"[12715\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of tricuspid valve replacement procedures carried out at St. James's Hospital in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1507","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2145,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":2146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2147,"qnumday":793,"qnumall":"[12716\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000104#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the capital works that were carried out at National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh in each of the years 2018 to 2020 and to date in 2021; the estimated cost of each project; and the duration of each of the capital works projects in tabular form.

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases).  <\/p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. <\/p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed.<\/p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.<\/p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000110#WRNN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":2576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000110#WRNN03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2577,"qnumday":943,"qnumall":"[13351\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031000110#WRNN03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a register is currently operational to record persons that are prescribed the drug sodium valproate during pregnancy;

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.

Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years. As such, no decisions have been made on the eligibility criteria which will need to be satisfied to a enable a person to access advanced AHR treatments through the public system. <\/p>  <p>  An important consideration in developing the model of care and in determining the parameters that would frame it, was its interplay with the broader AHR regulatory framework and the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.<\/p>  <p>   It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.

Farmers are advised through their remittance dockets where manual grading is applied. <\/p>  <p>  The suspension of mechanical grading following an inspection by DAFM occurred on four occasions in 2020 and the factories in questions were instructed to revert to manual grading. In all instances, classification officers from my Department conducted a classification check before a factory was allowed to recommence mechanical grading.<\/p>  <p>  During these 420 inspections, classification officers also monitored compliance with the EU reference carcase presentation specification. Monitoring of carcase presentation continues to be carried out by my Department's Veterinary Public Health staff based in the factories, on a daily basis.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, one factory has been fined for non-compliance with carcase presentation, details of which are published on the Department Website.

The current programme began on 1 January 2018 and will run until the end of 2022. SICAP aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality. It does this through Programme Implementers, agencies and companies, who work with the most disadvantaged and the hardest to reach in communities. It is a national programme delivered with funding of &euro;190 million over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. SICAP is overseen by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each local authority area. Each LCDC agrees annual targets for its area based on local needs. My Department has engaged Pobal to work on its behalf to manage and oversee the reporting of SICAP nationally. SICAP supports a range of groups in society which are disadvantaged and marginalized.<\/p><p>- The Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports 420 community organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model. CSP funding is provided as a contribution towards the cost of employing staff in these organisations. It meets local service gaps and provides services and facilities that would not be available otherwise. Some &euro;49million is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2021.<\/p><p>- The &euro;4.5 million Community Enhancement Programme aims to streamline funding to communities in need. The programme is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.  Its mission is to provide funding to improve facilities available to communities. The funding is allocated to each Local Authority area by a methodology that reflects deprivation levels in each area. This uses the Pobal-Hasse deprivation index.<\/p><p>- &euro;6.5 million is provided by my Department towards the regeneration of Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City (NEIC) to support the implementation of the Mulvey Report &ldquo;Creating a Brighter Future&rdquo; and the NEIC Strategic Plan 2020-2022.<\/p><p>- Community and Voluntary Pillar funding (&euro;565,000): My Department also provides annual funding to members of the Community and Voluntary Pillar to support costs, not funded from any other sources, directly related to the organisations &rsquo;contribution to policy-making.<\/p><p>- My Department&rsquo;s Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national, community and voluntary organisations that demonstrate good governance and deliver services and supports that have a focus on one or more of the following: addressing poverty, social exclusion and promoting equality. The current scheme commenced on 1 July 2019 and will cease on 30 June 2022. The application process for the current scheme is now closed. <\/p><p>- My Department has responsibility for administration of the Dormant Accounts Fund, including approving the measures to be funded from the Fund which are delivered across a range of Government departments.<\/p><p>- The Seniors Alert Scheme encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities, through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. Funding is available under the scheme towards the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of a personal alarm or pendant and is administered on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by Pobal. <\/p><p>- Up to &euro;75,700 is provided annually by my Department in respect of each Public Participation Network (PPN).<\/p><p>- My Department provides funding to supplement investment by local authorities in their library services. Funding is provided, for example, as a contribution towards the cost of developing library buildings, technological capacity and resources, book-stock and other areas of activity that enhance local library services. Responsibility for the delivery of public library services is generally a matter for each local authority in its capacity as a library authority under the Local Government Act 2001.<\/p><p>- My Department makes an annual payment to Local Authorities towards the  cost of additional staff to support the community function in local authorities. It is expected that these posts will continue to support the  Local Community Development Committee arrangements and the implementation of Local Economic and Community Plans in particular.<\/p><p>An additional &euro;10million has been allocated to the Stability Fund as part of the revised Resilience and Recovery plan announced in February by the Taoiseach. Further details on how relevant organisations can apply for this funding will be available shortly. The Government is aware of the challenges facing community and voluntary organisations and is committed to working closely with the sector in managing through these, recognising that it will require a whole of Government approach.<\/p><p>- The &euro;5.5m CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small-scale infrastructural projects in rural areas. While not delivered by the Community Division, CL&Aacute;R aims  to support sustainable development of designated areas which have experienced significant levels of depopulation. The funding works in conjunction with local funding and on the basis of locally identified priorities.
