This move by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Boris Johnson, and his Government is disgraceful and utterly reckless.  Mr Johnson's belligerent approach to Ireland is part of a cynical attempt to cling to power in Britain at any cost.  It jeopardises so much achieved by so many over such a long period of time.  It fundamentally undermines the Brexit protections for Ireland that were so hard won, and it risks serious economic and political damage.<\/p>  <p>  I share the view of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that Ireland will not be the collateral damage for irresponsible Tory actions.  Therefore, let us be clear.  The British Government's plan to strip away the protocol is a plan intentionally to break international law.  In a supreme act of bad faith, it intends to walk away from its legal obligations and agreements.  It is worth remembering that not alone did the British Government sign-up the protocol but, in fact, it was central to designing its content and operation.<\/p>  <p>  The utter recklessness of this move is underscored by the fact the protocol is, in fact, working.  It gives the North access to both the British market and the EU Single Market of more than 500 million people.  The North's economy is outperforming the English economy, business is growing and new jobs are being created.  Of course, cross-Border trade has increased significantly, and the all-island economy is thriving.  The Tory Government now puts all of this at risk.  We have heard voice after voice from the business community describe how this unilateral action threatens significant harm to businesses in Ireland and, indeed, in Britain.  It endangers thousands of jobs and investment.  The way to resolve implementation issues is to sit down and talk to the EU, but this is something the British have refused to do now for 123 days.  Instead of engagement, Mr. Johnson opts for shameful political play-acting.<\/p>  <p>  Tory disdain for political stability in Ireland is now up in lights again.  This latest move is part of a wider wrecking agenda that seeks to undermine the Good Friday Agreement and to rob our people of a better future.  Mr. Johnson allows the DUP to block the formation of an Executive in Belfast.  Mr. Johnson then uses this political deadlock as a threadbare excuse to break international law and pursue his self-serving agenda.  All the while, workers and families in the North are without a government as they struggle in a cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Is gn&iacute;omh cont&uacute;irteach de mheon m&iacute;mhac&aacute;nta &iacute; reachta&iacute;ocht Rialtas na Breataine chun an pr&oacute;tacal a sh&aacute;r&uacute;.

The publication of this legislation yesterday by the British Government and the contributions of various British Government Ministers who have attempted to justify it have amounted to a profoundly dispiriting moment.  I was in government when the Good Friday Agreement was sanctioned by our Government.  I was there during the early stages of the Good Friday Agreement and I was a Member of this House before the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>Reflecting on the transformation of the British-Irish relationship as well as on the involvement of the European Union and the United States in facilitating the Good Friday Agreement, what transpired yesterday is a profoundly damaging moment for the Good Friday Agreement itself.  More importantly, it demonstrates the degree to which the British Government now seems oblivious to the various sets of relationships in which it has engaged as well as to an international agreement to which it itself has signed up, whose ratification it promoted in the Westminster Parliament, and which it now has decided unilaterally potentially to upend it.<\/p><p>The British Government's published legislation would give powers to Ministers unilaterally to override aspects of the protocol itself.  This is reckless and, as I said earlier today, has the potential to destabilise politics in Northern Ireland.  It is also economically incoherent, damaging and the kind of legislation that clearly was framed without any significant engagement with industry or business in Northern Ireland.  It is clear from the manufacturing sector, the export sector and the dairy and meat sectors that the protocol has had an advantageous impact.  I have met all the various sectors who have articulated that reality to me and who are equally concerned about the dual regulatory proposals that are contained within the Secretary of State, Liz Truss&rsquo;s, proposals.  That would significantly undermine traceability within the food industry and would cause real issues for industry in general.<\/p><p>I met with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, last week, as well as with the Vice President, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d.  We have been in touch with colleagues in the United States as well.  As Deputy McDonald will know, a delegation representing the US Congress was recently in London, Brussels and Dublin.  Suffice to say, all parties find it difficult to comprehend the rationale for or the logic of the British Government&rsquo;s position, bar the domestic situation within UK politics itself.<\/p><p>Fundamentally, what has happened here is a violation of trust.  The real difficulty is, having entered into an international agreement with the European Union, colleagues across Europe are wondering why one would enter into a subsequent agreement, if the first agreement is so casually put to one side.<\/p><p>I want to reiterate one key point, which is that the European Union has been flexible right throughout these negotiations.  The European Union came forward proactively with proposals, having listened to parties in Northern Ireland and having listened to industry.  We asked them to go to Northern Ireland to engage, and they did.  This was not a <i>fait accompli<\/i>in terms of the proposals that were published last October, but as a basis for the resolution of legitimate issues that were raised by unionism and others around the operation of the protocol.  With substantive negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom Government, those issues could have been resolved and still can be resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1655212200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.

He is quite prepared to use political unionism in the North as a prop in that wider drama.  That is what is happening here.  He has actively colluded with the DUP to ensure we have no government in the North.  Then he cites political deadlock as an excuse for these actions, which, as the Taoiseach correctly pointed out, aim to breach international law.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important Boris Johnson does not succeed.  It is very important he is faced down.  This is about the protocol in the first instance but it is also about something, as the Taoiseach will appreciate, much wider and much more profound than that.

Fundamentally, and it is with regret I say this, I get the sense that the current British Government does not fully get the Good Friday Agreement or does not understand the DNA of the agreement and what it really means in terms of its own involvement and the co-guarantor nature of the involvement between the British and Irish Governments, but also the wider interest from the European Union and the United States.

I condemn yesterday's action by the British Government in moving to publish legislation to undermine the Northern Ireland protocol.  The legislation clearly amounts to a breach of international law.  We have all seen that the introduction of the Bill is already damaging the relationship between Britain and the EU.  It is a reckless and dangerous approach to a sensitive issue and it has the potential to undermine seriously the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  Where compromise and trust are needed, we instead see the British Government opting to ratchet up tensions by pursuing unilateral action and ignoring its international obligations.  In effect, we are seeing Johnson's Government acting like a rogue state.  It is as if Donald Trump had moved into No. 10 Downing Street.<\/p>  <p>  This is clearly a matter of immense concern to all of us and, notably, it will have the most difficult and devastating effect on the people of Northern Ireland, who, as we see, are being used, in effect, by the Tory Government as a proxy in its own internal battle.  As Tony Connelly of RT&Eacute; put it, \"Boris Johnson has courted the hard-line European Research Group (ERG) to try to cling to his position\", and we are now seeing the Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, seeking to do the same in an internal Tory battle for power.  This is no way to do business.  We are all agreed on that.  The path the British Government is pursuing will cause economic uncertainty, hinder the potential for growth in Northern Ireland and, as I have said, risks setting back and undermining the hard-won peace process.<\/p> <p>It is not too late to call for a return to constructive talks with the EU.  I met last week with the leader of the Opposition in Britain, Keir Starmer, as did the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  I put it to him that to proceed with this reckless and dangerous legislation is unconscionable.  Mr. Starmer has put that in clear terms himself.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, we also saw a cross-party grouping of MLAs in the Northern Ireland Assembly write to Prime Minister Johnson.  That group of MLAs represents the majority of voters in Northern Ireland who support collaboration and continued operation of the protocol.  Their message is that the Johnson Government must end the charade that its actions are somehow being undertaken to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  We know that is not the case and the Taoiseach has been clear on this too.  Those MLAs have called, as we do, for engagement by the British Government with the EU in further negotiation and for honesty about the inevitable consequences of this British Government's unilateral action.<br\/><br\/>The clear message that we want to give, which is shared across this House, is that we in this jurisdiction must not be bullied by the Conservative Party and its political allies.  Given the approach of the British Government, which we have seen seeking, effectively, <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>legal advice as to the consequences and content of this legislation, will the Taoiseach confirm that our Government's advice is that we now, unfortunately, due to the unilateral action of the British Government, face the risk of seeing an undermining of the peace process and even a return to a harder border on this island?  Is that risk now facing us, contrary to what this British Government's so-called <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>legal advice is supposedly telling it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400005#C00500","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655212500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy's comments and the sense of unity across the House in relation to this assault on an international agreement.  Fundamentally, that is what is potentially being considered by the British Government.  It is producing legislation which represents a breach of an international agreement it freely entered into.  The British Prime Minister advocated this protocol and trade agreement to the British Parliament.  It was ratified by the British Parliament and accepted.  Flowing from that then is the whole issue of trust in the conduct of international relations.  The EU, in particular, has engaged honourably, proactively and with a significant degree of trust in terms of its negotiations.  It is clear now that the British Government has not been acting in good faith in respect of the conduct of those negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The allegations or assertions from the British Government's side that Europe has not been proactive or flexible do not stack up.  They simply do not stand up.  Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d has been proactive.  The medicines supply issue, if we recall, was resolved nearly a year ago.  In fact, the European Parliament specifically passed legislation to facilitate the resolution of the medicines issue as it manifested at that time.  It was again encouraging to see the very warm support that I received as Taoiseach, on behalf of everybody here, at the European Parliament last week on this specific aspect.  Some of my consultations were on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  All parties in Northern Ireland have a right to be consulted in terms of the British Government's action and not just one party.  Their views should be sought and engaged with.  The majority of MLAs, as Deputy Bacik said, support the protocol.  They believe there can be changes to the operation of the protocol, as we do as well.  Issues have been raised and, in the context of my recent discussions with Commissioner &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d, he is prepared to come forward with further proposals to resolve these issues.  One never gets reciprocation from the British Government side.  One never gets clarity from the British Government side as to what the landing zone is in respect of an ultimate resolution of these particular issues.<\/p>  <p>  Economically, it is striking to talk to people on the ground.  An increasing number of businesses and industries can not only master or manage the protocol but find it advantageous.  What worries me most is the lack of real appreciation of the nuts and bolts of this by the British Government.  Its proposals are actually damaging economically.  They are damaging to industry and to jobs in Northern Ireland.  Talk to anyone involved in the manufacturing or export sectors or the food industry and agribusiness sector and they are all clear that they need a protocol.  They do not need it undermined.<\/p> <p>They actually need it.  We should focus on the sector of the Northern Ireland economy that has problems.

As the Taoiseach said, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and his team are seeking to negotiate in good faith.  There is now a dawning realisation across the EU that the British Government is not negotiating in good faith and has broken trust.  That is why I do not use the comparison with Donald Trump lightly.

Unfortunately, we are seeing the same development with the British Government's breach of trust.<\/p>  <p>  We in the Labour Party, as proud Europeans and members of the Party of European Socialists, look to support the Government and the efforts of the EU to engage in constructive negotiation, find the sort of constructive solutions to any issues facing communities and businesses in Northern Ireland and ensure that we do not see any support for the Tory government's breaking of trust in this international arena.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400007#E00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1655212800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I appreciate the comments and position adopted by the Deputy in respect of this issue.

The Assembly should never have been taken down.  The Assembly should always be formed immediately after an election because the people have spoken.  I find it very difficult to comprehend a situation in a democratic world whereby if the people have voted through the ballot box, their elected representatives are not facilitated in meeting to discuss the cost -of-living and bread-and-butter issues that affect their daily lives.

Owners and operators of nursing homes are struggling to stay afloat.  Many see no way forward.  I have received numerous calls and correspondence from nursing homes across County Tipperary.  All are desperate for support to save their businesses.  They are not making extravagant demands; they are simply seeking equality with public nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  This is a national issue.  The kernel of the problem is the discrimination by the State under the fair deal scheme in the resourcing of private, as opposed to public, nursing home resident care.  At present, public nursing homes receive 62% more per resident per week than what is available to pay for the care of an elderly person in a private nursing home.  Private nursing home owners are being tasked with doing the impossible and a growing number are holding on by their fingertips in the hope that their voices will finally be heard.  <\/p>  <p>  Private nursing homes are providing elderly care for fees of up to &euro;700 per week per resident, less than the amount allocated to their public counterparts.  It does not take a genius to see that, from a business perspective, there is no future for private nursing homes in Ireland if this alarming discrepancy is not addressed urgently.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also a significant differential in pay for HSE and private and voluntary health care assistants.  Approximately one in every two employees in nursing homes are healthcare assistants.  The pay differential is unfair and compounds the problem.  Private nursing homes are losing staff to better paid jobs in the HSE and elsewhere.  Staff in private nursing homes are outstanding.<\/p> <p>They are under enormous pressure.  Their patients are treated like family members.  Staff give the patients professional care and attention.  These staff deserve to have their work properly valued.<\/p> <p> Negotiations have been ongoing for years, but the discussions are going around in circles.  They are unending and unproductive.  I spoke to one nursing home owner who was recently forced to put &euro;90,000 of borrowed money into their business for it to survive.  Last week, I visited another loss-making home which is now dependent on the religious congregation to support the nursing home financially.  The financial loss is growing to such an extent that the congregation cannot make up that loss indefinitely.  They have spoken about the current and ongoing rises in the costs of heat, electricity and food.  They are simply unable to absorb the increased costs of those necessities in the private sector.  Private nursing homes must provide the same level of complex care many elderly residents require.  Public nursing homes have specialised needs provided at no cost by the HSE, while private operators must pay for services such as chiropody, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and even basic medical equipment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400007#E00400","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655213400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  As it transpires, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is meeting with the CEO of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, Mr. Liam Sloyan, to discuss the issues the Deputy raised and the general issues that face nursing homes and their ongoing relationship with the NTPF.  The nursing home representative bodies are also in discussions more generally.<\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 is the overall template that governs funding to support people accessing residential care.  Prices are negotiated, as the Deputy will know, for delivery by the designated State agency, namely the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Pricing agreements are reached with individual nursing homes by the NTPF, and the rates the fund offers are based on a set of standard criteria that include costs incurred by the nursing home in question.  Neither the Minister nor the Department has a role in individual price negotiations.  There is a variation between the cost of care in public and private homes.  Public nursing homes generally have higher costs and a higher staff-patient ratio.  They also deal with far more complex cases, in general.  There is about an 80:20 split, that is, 80% of all nursing home care is private and 20% is public, in the form of community nursing units, with a minimum of one in each county.  That balance has to be looked at over time but, whether private, voluntary or public care, the resident's financial contribution is the same.  The price of care affects only levels of State funding and has no direct impact on the resident.<\/p>  <p>  Last December, the Department published a value-for-money review of nursing home costs.  The purpose was to identify and to analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private and public nursing homes.  Again, the review found that the cost differential is driven largely by variances in staff-to-resident ratios and the skill mixes in public and private nursing homes.  Older infrastructure and the cost of upkeep of older buildings are a contributor in many of our community nursing units.  Nine recommendations have come out of that report, and the HSE is, with the Department of Health and the NTPF, working through the recommendations.  Delivery of those would lead, I think, to an improvement in the overall value for money delivered by the nursing homes support scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and the Government provided substantial support to the sector over the pandemic, with &euro;134 million to &euro;135 million in additional funding made available to private and voluntary nursing homes.

In my view, the ongoing medical and personal needs of elderly residents are practically the same, regardless of where they reside.<\/p> <p>It certainly does not make any sense to me to say that it costs 62% less in a private nursing home than it does in a public one.  The reality is that this is just not sustainable for private operators and it is expecting them to perform a miracle.  If the Taoiseach does not bring this matter to a conclusion and if it is not addressed successfully, the doors of private nursing homes in every town and village across Ireland will be forced to close.

There are people today up and down the country who might believe what a Government Minister says and who may think, maybe, that because they are struggling with the cost of fuel and of motoring that they should go to the local social welfare office because a Government Minister told them to do so.  That is a highly irresponsible act.  There are vulnerable people and those under duress and financial distress who could take that advice on board and go to a social welfare office.  That is a disgraceful thing and I ask the Taoiseach to tell people that that is a misleading comment because it is not factual.  If one speaks to any social welfare inspector, they will tell you that they have not been directed by this Government to deal with this in any way, shape or fashion.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach knows as much about social welfare as I do.  There is a thing called an SWA, a supplementary welfare allowance, which is allowed for in certain circumstances.  I can assure the Taoiseach that any genuine man, woman or younger person who will go before a social welfare officer today to say that they were sent by the Minister and asks for help will be told, through no fault of the social officer, that they cannot get this help, that they have no money to do so and that it is not at his or her discretion.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify that here before the D&aacute;il today.<\/p>  <p>  I highlight the fact that a gallon of diesel - for anyone who does not know, a gallon is 4.56 L - costs &euro;9.53.  The tax take of this Government on that gallon is &euro;4.20.  A gallon of petrol is &euro;9.72 of which the tax take is &euro;4.77.  This is totally ridiculous and shameful and our group, the Rural Independent Group, asked the Government last April to stop and to tackle the massive amount of tax that it is taking and to do something about it.  The Government voted against us, did nothing and its answers to the people now is to suck it up and to blow it out in bubbles because it will do nothing for them.  This is totally ridiculous and unfair.  The soaring petrol prices mean that massive revenues are wind-falling for the Government.  We hear every day from Ministers suggesting that there is nothing more that the Government can do.  This is, however, the same Government which took in more than &euro;300 million in taxes on petrol and diesel alone in April.  The Government is benefiting the most from the hardship and the harrowing conditions people have to go through when all that they are trying to do is to survive and to keep motoring and on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400009#G00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1655214300,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the cost of living.

That is the hard reality.  In the first instance, we need to do what we can to reduce the impact on people.  The Government has introduced &euro;2.4 billion in cost-of-living decisions since last October across the board.

In education, we took measures on examination fees.  We reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills and we also gave a &euro;200 energy credit to every household.  We cut the annual PSO levy by &euro;58 to zero by October 2022.

He gave me a first-hand account of events on the ground in Ukraine, including, in particular, the appalling killings and destruction in Bucha and the continuing attacks on civilians and towns.  The Prime Minister, who was on his way to discussions at the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in Washington, outlined Ukraine's urgent need for financial assistance, both to enable the its Government to keep essential services going and to reconstruct infrastructure and buildings after the war.  He also indicated areas where particular technical assistance will be required to help make Ukraine safe again in the face of the enormous damage caused by the war.  He reiterated the determination of the Ukrainian Government to protect its people and resist the ongoing aggression by Russian forces.<\/p>  <p>  I expressed Ireland's strong support for Ukraine's application to join the EU.  The Commission will shortly publish its opinion on the application, which will be discussed by the European Council at its meeting later this month.  I also expressed our support for the strongest sanctions against Russia and those in Russia supporting or facilitating the war.  A significant sixth package of sanctions against Russia, which will see an end to the importation of 90% of Russian crude oil and petroleum products, was subsequently agreed at the special meeting of the European Council on 30 and 31 May.  Prime Minister Shmyhal expressed his gratitude for Ireland's ongoing support for Ukraine, including in welcoming Ukrainians who have sought refuge in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I met with the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dmytro Kuleba, during my visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos on 25 May.  He briefed me, in particular, on latest developments in the war, especially in Donbas, where there have been a large number of both military and civilian casualties.  I expressed my total horror at the brutal way in which Russian forces are destroying towns and villages.  I also had an opportunity for a short exchange with the mayor of Kyiv, Mr. Vitali Klitschko, while in Davos.<\/p>  <p>  I met with the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Ms Olga Stefanishyna, during her recent visit to Dublin on 3 June.  She was especially focused on seeking support for Ukraine's EU application.  She said that while the Ukrainian Government fully appreciates that joining the EU is a complex process, in which relevant criteria must be met, a strong signal from the European Council at this time would be of very significant value to the people of Ukraine, who are enduring so much.  I expressed our support and undertook to engage with other EU leaders to ensure the most positive message possible is sent.  I also met with the Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, Mr. Ruslan Stefanchuk, during my visit to the European Parliament on 8 June.  I again set out Ireland's unequivocal support for his country and his people.  He expressed his gratitude to the Government and people of Ireland.  In my address to the European Parliament, I said that those countries looking to join the EU should be supported in undertaking the reforms and preparations necessary and that, when they meet the criteria, we should not place further barriers in their way.  I expressed my hope that when the European Council meets in June and considers its application, it will be possible to send the people of Ukraine a clear and positive message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400017#R03225","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1655218200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for the update on his meeting with the Ukrainian Prime Minister and for his expression of support from the Government for the rapid accession of Ukraine to the EU.

These and many other examples of voluntary activity around the country to support Ukrainians are hugely welcome.  The ambassador conveyed to me her thanks to Ireland for the huge support we have given to Ukrainians fleeing war but expressed concern about accommodation and that the Ukrainian adults who come here wish to engage in paid employment.

Sadly, it is drifting when the war is perhaps getting most vicious, particularly in the Donbas region.  We see the true extent of the crimes that Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people.  It is rarely being covered and is not being discussed to the same extent that it was in the first fortnight of the war.  This happens with many conflicts and it is understandable.  It behoves all of us who spoke so passionately on this previously, regardless of what side of the debate we were on or what angle, to continue to press this.<\/p>  <p>  We have to remember this war is exacerbating so many of the difficulties that all the countries across the EU are facing.

Like Deputy Haughey, I think the EU can go further and there can be a seventh round of sanctions.  Regarding Ireland's role, the next time the EU agrees supports for Ukraine will we put financial resources behind EU lethal military support for the Ukrainians?

I cite Dublin's inner city as an example, where serious resource issues existed prior to Putin's criminal war on Ukraine.  I raised those issues with the Taoiseach on several occasions.  Now, however, this situation has been exacerbated almost beyond breaking point.  We saw last weekend reports of issues around housing and accommodation, with people sleeping on the floors of hotels.

I share with Deputy Bacik her horror at this war and the extraordinary inhumanity visited on the people of Ukraine.  Towns have been levelled to oblivion almost in respect of buildings.  Civilians have been targeted consistently.  The Deputy also correctly identified a range of volunteer organisations and individuals that have been extremely supportive of the response here to the situation.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Ukraine's application for membership of the EU, there has been proactive diplomatic engagement by the Ukrainian Government.  This has been represented most recently by the four parliamentarians here these days in respect of supporting Ukraine's application.  We are engaging with the European Commission and its President, and with others, to pursue that.  On Deputy Haughey's point, to be fair in the context of the sixth round of sanctions, it gets more challenging as we get higher up the rounds.  The sanction on the importation of Russian oil is a significant move, because quite a number of EU countries are very dependent on Russian oil and gas, unlike us and some other states.  Therefore, it is rather easier for us to declare our support in this regard.  To be fair, countries such as Germany and others are taking on board significant pressure by reducing their dependency on Russian oil very quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe there is a weakening of solidarity.  As I said to Deputy Bacik regarding the application for EU membership, I hope that by the time of the next meeting of the European Council, in the next fortnight, that we will be able to achieve some degree of unity of purpose concerning Ukraine's application.  There are challenges.  Some countries have a more technocratic approach to applications to joining the EU.  In a time of war, however, I believe it is necessary to send a simple and clear message to the people of Ukraine that they belong within the EU.  We should be unequivocal about that message of support.  I met with the speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, as I said earlier.  He sends his best wishes to the Ceann Comhairle and appreciates his recent meeting with him and with the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  This clear message regarding the Ukrainian application is the point.  Generally speaking, I favour a more proactive approach to enlargement in the western Balkans and in the neighbourhood of the EU more generally.  A passive approach in this regard leads to manipulation by other powers that are not really advancing the cause of the citizens of those countries in the neighbourhood of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of a ceasefire or a settlement, the leaders at the European Council have been adamant, especially the German Chancellor and the French President, that it is a matter for Ukraine to determine the timing and criteria governing any ceasefire and the conditions and so on.  Also, in terms of the reconstruction of Ukraine, the governments of Europe stand ready to support that fairly substantially.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond raised similar points.

During my visit to Lebanon, I met the head of mission and force commander of UNIFIL, Major General Aroldo L&aacute;zaro S&aacute;enz, visited the town of Tibnin, laid a wreath at the memorial in memory of the 47 members of the Defence Forces who lost their lives serving in Lebanon, met members of the local community, visited the Defence Forces stationed at UN position 2-45, observed their important work first-hand and visited UN position 652, which helps to secure the Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel.  During my visit I also had short meetings with the Deputy Prime Minister of Lebanon, Saadeh Al Shami, and the Minister of Tourism, Walid Nassar.

It is a breach of international law and has crippled the economy, with two thirds of the population reliant on humanitarian assistance.

UN special rapporteur Michael Lynk has called for Israel's latest escalation of rocket attacks on Gaza to be investigated by the International Criminal Court.

I ask him to perform a very simple act of solidarity that would go a long way towards alleviating that horror.  There are tens of thousands of Ukrainian people living in Poland, having fled Ukraine since the start of the war.  Many are women who have been raped by Russian soldiers as part of the war effort.  Rape is always used as a weapon in war.  As a result, many of them end up pregnant.  Under current Polish legislation, those who find themselves pregnant as a result of rape and who wish to seek an abortion have to go to court to prove they have been raped.  That law is being applied to those Ukrainian women who have been raped by members of the Russian army or the other forces attacking them.  They are being cruelly treated in being told they must also prove they are pregnant as a result of rape before they can access abortion.  That is inhuman and cruel.  There will be an amendment by The Left party before the parliament next week to lift that restriction and to allow Ukrainian women access to abortion.  Access for all is hugely important.

The legislation can be seen in that context.  Boris Johnson is, in effect, setting aside international law, destroying British-Irish relations and EU-UK relations, weakening the Good Friday Agreement and risking a trade war between the EU and the UK.  The British Government has said that it is setting aside the protocol to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The complete opposite is, in fact, the case.  The legislation has been brought forward simply to appease just one of the political parties in the North, to the detriment of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole.

We have consistently, at EU level but, more significantly, at the UN Security Council, raised issues pertaining to Israeli policy within the West Bank, settlements and a range of other matters.  We have been probably one of most consistent and proactive countries in that regard, most recently in respect of the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Al-Jazeera journalist.  I met with the President of Israel, at his request, on the margins of Davos.  He has strong Irish connections, as the House will be aware.  We never lose an opportunity to put across our perspective and viewpoint on the settlement policy and how wrong it is and the need for a two-state solution to that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I say to Deputy McDonald and others that, internationally, Ireland is one of the few countries that continues to hold Israel to account for its actions in the Middle East.  The US and others continue to support the position of Israel on the Middle East, although they also provide significant supports.  President Biden provides supports.  His administration has restored some supports for Palestinians that President Trump had got rid of.  A broader international effort is required in advocating on behalf of the Palestinians with Americans and others to get balance, a proper approach and a proper process involved in order to have a meaningful opportunity for a two-state solution and financial supports for the West Bank and Gaza and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA.  The European Union has made the strongest representations recently.  The Commission was making attempts to put conditions on supports to the Palestinian Authority in the form of funding from Europe and we have pushed very hard to have those conditions removed.  We feel that is an unacceptable new development in respect of EU funding of the Palestinian Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The Horn of Africa crisis, which Deputy Bacik raised, is a very serious issue in respect of the potential of famine arising out of Putin's war.  Without question, Putin has weaponised energy, food and migration.  That is a real issue facing the world right now.  I do not accept the proposition regarding a TRIPS waiver.  The European Union has, however, reached agreement with the leaders of Africa, particularly through the African Union, following the recent European Union - African Union summit.  Europe is the only real player involved in investing huge funds to develop the capacity to manufacture mRNA vaccines and technology more generally into the future in Africa - in South Africa and Senegal.  It never gets acknowledged in this House.  I am not referring to Deputy Boyd Barrett, but others in the House keep beating the anti-European Union drum.  Actually, the European Union has been the great donor of vaccines.  The issue with vaccines is no longer a TRIPS waiver.  I never accepted that it was and thought at the time that the TRIPS waiver was more a sound bite than a solution.  There is a surplus of vaccines at the moment.  What is really at stake now is getting the vaccines into people's arms, overcoming a lot of hesitancy about vaccines across Africa and various states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400020#U00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1655220000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>A Thaoisigh, I remind you of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400020#U00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1655220000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Am I over time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400020#U00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1655220000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>You are way over.

It will continue to help us deepen our understanding of how to deliver more affordable and sustainable housing systems, drawing on international and national experience, including ongoing work in Ireland on cost rental.<\/p>  <p>  NESC is supporting work on Ireland's well-being framework by examining how well-being frameworks are implemented in practice.  NESC has also undertaken an extensive programme of research and consultation to support the shared island initiative.  It produced a report on this in the first quarter of 2022 which made recommendations in five key areas: economy and infrastructural investment; social policy; climate and biodiversity; well-being frameworks; and data co-ordination.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it will examine aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic to help identify strategic lessons about public governance and how Government can be supported to arrange and manage its activity to deliver the best results for society.<\/p>  <p>  The NESC Council published five reports in 2021 and one report in 2022.

We see reports that the emergency department in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, is to be closed.

It seems to me that this is something that is not understood by the British Government particularly with its dual regulatory approach in food traceability which puts a lot of agrifood industries and enterprises at risk if it proceeds with its proposals as announced yesterday.  The agricultural interests and the meat and dairy industries that I met are very clear about the negative impact that the Foreign Secretary's proposals would have on the agrifood industry in Northern Ireland.  That is what illustrates more than anything the lack of real thinking through of those proposals by the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  Responding to Deputy Boyd Barrett, there is no doubt that the cost of the war is feeding into shortages in materials and so on as did the imbalance in supply and demand occasioned by the bounce-back of the economies after Covid.  The war has exacerbated that particularly with the costs in fuel and commodities beyond anything that we have experienced before.  That is a big factor in housing inflation.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Gino Kenny's points, the last two years have seen record recruitment levels into the HSE front line staff, with nursing, doctors etc.  In the junior doctors strike, culture in the medical profession is the key issue.  We have had these campaigns where they have been met with increased salaries, as they have before, and promises that the culture would change in how junior doctors are treated but that change has not always transpired.

It is necessary to address an urgent lacuna in the law regarding the legal basis for Garda court presenters.  The specific purpose of the Bill is to establish clearly a right of any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct a prosecution, whether or not that member initiated the prosecution.  It restores the system of court presenters which existed prior to a determination of the High Court on 31 May.<\/p><p>The circumstances that the provisions are designed to address are of an exceptional nature.  They arise from a judgment in a case stated from the District Court to the High Court.  The legislation will restore the <i>status quo<\/i>for the Garda court presenters, allow the District Courts to function effectively and address the needs of accused persons and victims to have their cases heard before courts of summary jurisdiction.  Consideration is being given to appeal the judgment.<\/p><p>The amendment will come into effect on enactment and applies to prosecutions currently in progress as well as future prosecutions.<\/p><p>First, I will outline the background to the Bill and why there is a need for emergency legislation.  In a judgment in a consultative case stated from the District Court in the case of the DPP at the suit of Garda Liam Varley <i>v. <\/i>Ciar&aacute;n Davitt, the High Court found there to be no legal basis underpinning the system of Garda court presenters.<\/p><p>Court presenters are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who specialise in court work in the District Court dealing with important procedural matters including evidence of arrest, charge and caution in first appearances in court, remands, bail applications and presenting a summary of evidence in guilty pleas.  The practice of allowing separate Garda members to perform these roles is well established and widely relied upon in the State.  It enables more efficient use of police resources by reducing the need for individual garda&iacute; to attend court to prosecute every criminal offence they detect.  These prosecutorial functions are carried out on behalf of the DPP under section 8 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Section 8(1) of the 2005 Act removes the right of a Garda to prosecute as a common informer, and section 8(2) supports this by providing that Garda&iacute; may bring summary prosecutions only in the name of the DPP.<\/p><p>Section 8(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 states that: (2) Subject to subsection (3), any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may institute and conduct prosecutions in a court of summary jurisdiction, but only in the name of the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p><p>In the judgment in the Davitt case, the High Court held that the ordinary and natural meaning of the word &quot;and&quot; in the phrase &quot;institute and conduct&quot; in section 8(2) is that the word must be read conjunctively.  To state it another way is to say that the same Garda member must perform both actions - &quot;initiate&quot; and &quot;conduct&quot;.  Accordingly, a Garda member has a right of audience to conduct any proceedings that he or she has instituted, but the section does not confer a right of audience on a Garda in any other proceedings.<\/p><p>Given this interpretation of section 8(2) of the 2005 Act, the court held that order 6, rule 1 of the District Court rules, which confers a right of audience on all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and not just the Garda who initiated the prosecution, is an impermissible amendment of the 2005 Act concluding that the rule is <i>ultra vires<\/i>the enabling legislation and could not be relied on by the District Court judge in affording a right of audience to a Garda who had no involvement in initiating the prosecution.  The net effect of the judgment is that no Garda, acting in a case other than one where he is the named complainant may address a court as presenter.  This includes bail applications and guilty pleas.  The court presenters, therefore, are now no differently positioned than civilians when dealing with a court.  In such circumstances the presence of a solicitor or counsel, or the actual prosecuting Garda is a prerequisite in all District Court cases for the time being.  On 2 June the High Court judge clarified that the judgment does not take effect until the final orders are made.  The case was adjourned until 16 June. <\/p><p>So far, I have set out the legal implications of the judgment.  Now I turn my attention to the impact on the actual workings of the District Court following the judgment.  The ruling has immediate and serious implications for the conduct of criminal prosecutions in the State as the system of Garda court presenters is well established and widely relied upon across the State.  The contingency measures put in place after the judgment issued and prior to the clarification made by the judge as to the effect of the judgment, and the ensuing disruption in that period, give an indication of the impact the judgment will have if remedial legislation is not enacted before the judgment comes into effect.<\/p><p>In Dublin, the DPP had to arrange for court solicitors to be present at all sittings of the 13 District Courts and instructions issued to State solicitors outside of Dublin to cover courts, where possible.  The instituting Garda member was also to be present wherever possible.  Further mitigating measures were also considered including the use of counsel from the DPP's High Court bail panel to cover the Dublin districts with ongoing liaison with Garda headquarters to ensure that Garda directives were in-line with the approach being taken by the DPP.<\/p><p>In a single day, 2 June, over 2,131 cases were before the District Courts across the country, and notwithstanding the measures outlined above, hundreds of cases had to be adjourned.  In one court alone, 130 cases had to be adjourned.  Once the judgment comes into effect, this impact will be magnified for each District court, in each county, for each day that the legislation is not amended.<\/p> <p>In addition to the substantial impact on the work of court and State solicitors and prosecuting garda&iacute;, the adjournment of cases has caused significant distress and upset to victims and accused persons.  There will be a knock-on effect in terms of delays in preparing books of evidence in other potentially more serious trials, work that would ordinarily be undertaken by deployed staff from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.<\/p> <p> The judgment also gives rise to a risk of Article 40 applications by persons remanded in custody or refused bail in the District Court where the DPP was represented by the court presenter and not a prosecuting Garda member.  Article 40 of the Constitution permits persons to apply to the High Court for release on the basis they are unlawfully detained.  Mitigating arrangements cannot be sustained over the long term from a cost and effectiveness perspective, and there remains a risk of Article 40 applications to the High Court.<\/p> <p> I will now briefly outline the contents of the Bill to the House.  The purpose of the Bill is to establish clearly a right for any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct a prosecution, whether or not that member initiated the prosecution, restoring the system of court presenters that existed prior to this judgment.  A short three-section Bill is proposed that amends the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to amend \"institute and conduct\" in section 8(2) in order that it reads \"institute or conduct\" and provide that the prosecution may be conducted by the instituting Garda member or any other member.  The amendment will come into effect on enactment and applies to prosecutions currently in progress as well as future prosecutions.<\/p> <p> That is where we are at and I look forward to hearing comments from the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400022#W02300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655221800,"counter":297,"content":"<p>We are supporting this amendment.  When this situation arose a few weeks ago, many Deputies throughout the country would have been contacted by people in the legal profession and by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were very concerned about the outcome of the amendment and the potential risks it involved.  As the Minister of State stated in his remarks, a considerable body of work is carried out through our District Court system throughout the State.  We are just after coming out of a Joint Committee on Justice meeting at which we discussed the fact we had waived the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  It is very reluctantly we do so because we should, as a norm, carry out pre-legislative scrutiny all the time.  In this situation, most members of the committee recognise that this amendment was ensuring what has been common practice up until now can continue.  It is a very small amendment to ensure that happens.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are questions at which we need to look.  What has been common practice?  Is it appropriate that it has been common practice?  It is appropriate that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na act as prosecutors when the same organisation is the investigator of crime?  It needs to be acknowledged that there has to be work done to look at that.  In the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland document, which has been endorsed by Government and all parties in this Chamber, there is a reference to that whole issue needing to be looked at and examined.<\/p>  <p>  That is not to recognise that the vast majority of these cases, especially in the District Court, are for minor offences.  However, some of the cases are serious offences that can have a serious impact on the individuals who are charged.  It is something we need to recognise.  Change needs to happen in that area because members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are better out in the community keeping people safe and making sure that crime does not happen, rather than being caught up in court proceedings.  I think all of us would acknowledge that is the case.  However, to make that happen, a process of change needs to come about over a period of time.  In that situation, certain more serious categories may be removed from the Garda court presenter and there would then be a staged element where the Government would, I hope, up the capacity of the State Solicitor's office to deal with these issues on an ongoing basis across the District Court system.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that, for the majority of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who engage in this work, there are usually one or two who specialise in it in each area.  From my understanding, it is always sergeants who do this.  They have experience and knowledge and know what they are doing.  They have been there before, are known to the court system and know the system very well.  In that context, we have proposed an amendment for Committee Stage that specifies any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na above the rank of sergeant.  It would be appropriate to include that and I hope the Minister recognises that would be an appropriate amendment, because it is in standing with what is and continues to be common practice across the board.<\/p>  <p>  Our courts system, especially our District Court system, is under considerable pressure.  The outcome of this judgment was going to put it under even more pressure.  We recognise the District Court system is very slow due to the number of judges we have in place.  There is a recognition we need to expand that.  We need to ensure justice is not only done effectively but also efficiently.  People face very long waiting times to have their cases proceed.  Much of that is down to the fact we do not have enough judges in the system.  There are also other aspects of it that need to improve.  The pressure the pandemic put on the system meant the system had to respond.  The system responded quite well in many cases and there were situations in which technology and innovative practices came into play that made it more effective and efficient.  That is all to be welcomed and they need to be mainstreamed.  We recognise that and will work with Government to make that happen.<\/p>  <p>  Primarily, the issue we are dealing with in this amendment, to ensure what has been common practice up to now is maintained, should be short-lived legislation.  We need to look at it as we go forward.  If we are to implement the vision for policing document, we certainly have to look at this as a short-term measure and look at a way of relieving these duties from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, ensure it moves into the State Solicitor's office and ensure that office is properly resourced to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  The issues several members of the committee had with regard to not waiving pre-legislative scrutiny were appropriate.  It is unfortunate that a mechanism is not found to ensure members of the Joint Committee on Justice are not given at least a technical briefing with regard to issues such as this when they come up.  That should happen.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure we do not have this situation in the future.  I know this is an emergency and last week was not a sitting week.  We had all those factors into play.  In broad terms, it is poor practice that things such as this should be sprung on the Joint Committee on Justice and the Houses of the Oireachtas in that manner and that we would move them so fast without being able to take a breath and look at them closely.  It is poor practice, especially if it is something that is more complex that may need a little more scrutiny.  I accept this is very simple legislation that keeps in place the process we have at present, but it is not good practice to continue behaving in that manner into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The overall District Court system needs to be dealt with adequately.  Once this amendment is through, and I expect the amendment will be worked very quickly through the process here because it is very simple and understandable for people what the amendment is trying to do, the broader picture needs to be looked at in detail.  There needs to be a firm commitment from Government to ensure we get our District Court system right, that it practises well, delivers for everyone and is effective and efficient for people who are before the courts and who are working in that system.  I hope the Minister will take our amendment on board when it comes forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400023#X00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1655221800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>The Bill restores the right of Garda court presenters to bring prosecutions by giving it a legal basis.  Two weeks ago, the case of Garda Liam Varley and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Davitt came before the High Court.  The judgment in this case was that there is no legal basis underpinning the system of Garda court presenters at District Court level.  The effect of the decision is that no Garda other than the prosecuting Garda has a right of audience in respect of a case.  This issue needs to be addressed by this Thursday, which is why we are here today discussing the emergency legislation.  Having examined the Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in has submitted an amendment to ensure Garda court presenters are not below the rank of sergeant.  If the Minister of State does not accept the amendment, the unintended consequence of the Bill will be that probationary garda&iacute; will given the ability to act as court presenters.<\/p> <p>We have grave concerns about this.  Currently, Garda court presenters are mostly local sergeants.  They represent the State in court proceedings by setting out the offence committed, including details of an arrest, charge and caution, along with an outline of the circumstances of the offence.  They do this whether they are the prosecuting garda or not.  This allows the State prosecutor to focus on the more serious cases in the higher courts.  This is a well-established system across the State and has been in place since 1948.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have not opposed this Bill due to the emergency nature of the amendment required to restore the power of Garda court presenters.  We will support the passage of the Bill through both Houses.  However, this is an unsatisfactory way for the Minister for Justice and the Government to conduct business, especially with regard to the prosecution of those before the courts.<\/p> <p> I also raise the issue of Garda numbers and visibility.  If a garda from Rathangan in County Kildare is in court, one other garda is left in the station.  If that other garda has a day off, there is nobody in that station.  It is the same in Castledermot in County Kildare.  Recently, a garda was on the street in Kildare town.  Several people said to me that is rare.  That is shocking.  We need more garda&iacute;.  They need to be more visible.  There needs to be less red tape, which ties garda&iacute; up.<\/p> <p> We need to look at court conditions and the capacity of the courts.  Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about that.  We have courts in antiquated buildings.  We only have one judge in Kildare.  He is doing the best he can in difficult circumstances but he is under immense pressure.  The list often stretches to double figures and it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> I recently discovered there are just nine drugs personnel in County Kildare.  They do amazing work and punch well above their weight with the number of seizures, but we need more than nine.  There is currently a drugs epidemic in south Kildare.  We need to do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400023#X00300","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655222400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>My colleagues have stated our position.  We will obviously support this.  We cannot have a case where we do not facilitate court presenters.  I think Deputy Kenny stated we will table an amendment.  It does not make sense to us that these presenters would not be sergeants or higher, because they need to be.  We need to make sure we do not end up with a novice or probationary garda in that position.  I also reiterate that we need to move this on.  This function should be operated by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  That would free up garda&iacute; to do the specific work we need them to do.<\/p>  <p>  This is hardly the first time any of us have spoken about the backlog in courts, particularly in the Circuit Court and higher courts.  Any sort of serious criminal activity is generally handled in them.  Even when garda&iacute; have done really decent work to deal with dangerous criminals, especially drug-dealing criminals who engage in violent activity, when action is taken, there is often a battle a day about remand, whether people are going to be released, and their specific conditions, especially if there has been violence or threats of violence.  From time to time, we get satisfactory results in the sense that people are barred from certain areas or regions.  That can be incredibly beneficial but it takes far too long.  It could take four or five years.<\/p>  <p>  On the wider issue of organised crime and drugs, as much as we welcome the increased resources for drugs squad activities, particularly in Dundalk and Drogheda, where there have been major disruptions to the drugs supply, the problem has got beyond us.  We need work on the citizens' assembly and more novel ways of dealing with this.  The local superintendent attended a community meeting and the drugs squad was reformed in Dundalk.  There were significant results.  He said at the time it could do with more numbers, whether 50 or 100 more garda&iacute;.  Then he stopped himself and said to show him anywhere where someone has actually taken on and won the war on drugs.  We all accept that dangerous criminals need to be dealt with and the courts system has sufficient resources to make sure the process does not take forever, but there is wider work to do.  It goes without saying we have to deal with the wider issue of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  My biggest concern is we have failed to deliver the required community and family supports.  Even though there is a cost to doing these, we have seen pilot projects that have worked for many years.  We have a very unfortunate history in this State of operating pilot schemes and leaving them in a small number of areas and not necessarily rolling them out.  Sometimes, where they are working in small areas with limited numbers, we do not expand their resources but we expand the region they have to deal with.  They then have the same issue as in all other under-resourced services that are under pressure and they cannot deliver for the people.<\/p>  <p>  We need a sufficient number of garda&iacute;, resources in court and addiction services to address the drugs issue.  We have work to do on diversion programmes.  We are failing early on by not investing enough resources in young people, their families and the wider community so that we can get to a better place.  We have a complete multi-agency response to education and health.  It is also about ensuring we can bridge a gap so that marginalised people, in particular, can get employment or into further education.  We have many of the correct pieces.  We just have not put them and the system together.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of sergeants, I will talk about Dundalk.  We have had insufficient supervision because we have not had enough sergeants.  I am glad the number has been increased, but it is not enough.  I am glad we now have a sergeant who has taken responsibility for community policing.  I have spoken to both the new chief superintendent and superintendent about that.  It is vital work.  We do not have sufficient community policing and more interaction between the community policing service, the drugs squad and so on is needed.  Relationships between garda&iacute; and the communities they police are not always how they need to be.  Sometimes, very good work is done, but at other times, it is not so good and they are missing vital information.  One could call it intelligence.  I have seen people being stopped and searched, which I have no difficulty with, but sometimes the garda&iacute; miss that a person might not be causing any particular issue and may just be going to his or her granny's house.  We know there are other more problematic cases.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying that the more pressure can be brought to bear quickly on drugs operations, the better.  I am looking for that while accepting we have more work to do.  Even if we have a citizens' assembly and the perfect proposals are put together, I feel that even a 32-county Ireland is very small and we probably need to look at a solution on a European level or higher.  We know the situation outside and inside every District Court.  We know people who have not access to or cannot access drug addiction services are caught up in minor crime.<\/p> <p>Some of them can be incredibly significant for those who are impacted.  All it indicates to me is the failure of the system.  We need to have that piece of work.  We will make the attempt at local level, dealing with the Garda and other stakeholders to increase community policing and ensure it is integrated through the entire operations of the Garda as much as is possible.  I get that the service is absolutely under pressure.  We need to put the resources where they are needed.<\/p> <p> As I stated earlier, we have to be able to deal with the backlog in the courts system, which causes great unease and difficulty.  Even in respect of ensuring witnesses are going to provide information that is necessary, the longer the time goes on, the more room there is for things we would not like to see happen.  Witnesses sometimes feel under too much pressure and step away from situations.  I am thinking of a number of instances where this has happened or may happen.  There is a cost to all these things.  We need to ensure we can put a proper system together.  That is the bit that is missing.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in supports the legislation.  It is absolutely necessary.  I hope the Government will listen to our proposed amendment in respect of sergeants.  It is just sensible.  We really need to get to the end of this.  I have slight worries in respect of the Louth Garda division that the chief superintendent is going to be responsible for Louth and Cavan-Monaghan.  It is a huge area and this may create difficulties into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400024#Y00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655223000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The Labour Party welcomes this legislation, which is coming from the High Court ruling on court presenters.  I am taken by the letter written by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to the Ceann Comhairle.  She states that on a single day, 2 June, more than 2,131 cases were before the District Court throughout the country.  Notwithstanding contingency measures put in place, hundreds of cases had to be adjourned.  In one court alone, 130 cases had to be adjourned, which has caused significant distress and upset to victims and accused persons.  These cases will be added to the already lengthy backlog of cases arising from Covid disruption.  Clearly, the court presenter system, without any legislative underpinning, was holding the District Court system together.  If it is struck down by the High Court, the legislative body of the Oireachtas then needs to act.  The Government is acting and we support that action.<\/p>  <p>  I do not necessarily agree, however, with the Minister's suggestion that delays are purely down to Covid.  Anybody who works in the system will attest to the fact there is a lack of judges.  That has to be addressed.  It is part of the issue that is leading to such delays in our District Court system.  It is slightly alarming that a ruling like this can shine a light on a practice that is holding the District Court system together and maintain that it does not have legislative underpinning.  Are the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice analysing our systems so there is no other issue that may come to light in future that could be struck down by the High Court?  It is important there is robust analysis of how our system of justice operates.  If something so fundamental to how a case proceeds through a District Court process can be identified by a High Court judge as not having legislative underpinning, is there anything else?  As a result of this judgment, is the Government, the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice or any agency conducting a robust analysis of how the District Court operates so that we do not find ourselves in this situation again?  It does not reflect well on us as an Oireachtas that such legislation has to come before us without pre-legislative scrutiny and has to be rushed through the Houses so quickly.  If someone is in front of a District Court, this may be his or her only chance to get a level of justice, be that person an accused person or somebody on the other side of the issue.  It would cause me and, I am sure, the Minister and the Government, disquiet that such a fundamental element of how this is run could be deemed to be without a legislative underpinning.  The lack of judges is part of the problem.  We need a robust analysis of how our District Court system is operating.<\/p>  <p>  I am heartened by the words of Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; when he speaks to how drug offences are dealt with.  I feel that across the Oireachtas we have potential for great change here.  As the Deputy said, there is a citizens' assembly due in the new year on the issue of drugs.  Those who work in this area know a massive number of the drug possession cases that have come before our courts do not need to be there at all.  Some 70% of drug cases are for possession for personal use.  The vast majority of cases are against people who are addicted to something or who use something.  In other jurisdictions, they are funnelled through a very different path.  We talk about harm reduction and using the health system primarily, not the courts system.  If the Minister takes a trip to the drug court, which has a certain level of success, she will observe a courtroom full of sick people.  They should not be sitting in a courtroom looking at a judge.  Those who have an addiction fundamentally do not belong in a courtroom interacting with the criminal justice system, garda&iacute; and judges.  That is not where they should be.  The citizens' assembly, as indicated by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, is the right forum for us to analyse properly how other jurisdictions are dealing with this issue.  I refer to Portugal and various states in America.  We should take issues of personal use and addiction out of our courts system.  They do not belong there.  We need to find another mechanism for dealing with them.  If we were to do that, we would free up a lot of court time and Garda time that could be spent tackling the pushers, the gangs and the industry rather than the victims, who are the ones inevitably in front of the courts.<\/p>  <p>  We appreciate the Government had to act and is acting.  The Minister is bringing forward legislation without pre-legislative scrutiny because there is a time issue and that is fair enough.  However, the Government has to recognise that if a High Court judge has struck down something so fundamental to the operation of our courts system, what else is there?  What else could there be?  Are there other legal loopholes that need to be strengthened so we do not find ourselves in this position again?  If we are back here again in six months' time because a High Court judge sees something else that does not have a legal underpinning, it is not going to reflect well on us at all.<\/p>  <p>  On the day-to-day operation of a court, I encourage the Minister to go down to the drug court or any court.  For any Member of the Oireachtas or member of the public who is not familiar with what happens there, whenever I have taken the opportunity to witness it at first hand, it is really striking how those who are in the accused position need an awful lot more help, compassion, understanding, medical intervention and counselling than is being afforded to them.  Many of these cases could be dealt with in a very different way.  Other jurisdictions that have dealt with it in a different way have seen the number of drug cases and overdoses collapse.  They have seen the number of people in heroin dependency programmes collapse as well.  That is my main point.  Let us not be here again because of something else we overlooked.  Let us deal with the lack of judges, because it is leading to delays within the courts system.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>If we have the opportunity and if there is goodwill, as Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; indicated, across the parties in this House to deal with the issue of drug offences differently, we will have a radically reformed courts system and a much better way to empower somebody with a drug use or addiction issue.  As any observer knows, the last person to whom somebody with a drug use or addiction issue needs to be talking is a garda or judge.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400025#Z00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655223600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and speaking about its provisions.  As stated by colleagues on the justice committee and others, the committee considered this matter at its meeting this afternoon, obviously after the fact in the sense that we granted the waiver last week in corporeal fashion.  We were happy to do so as the volume of cases going through the courts was such that the system was threatening to grind to a halt.  I considered the figures earlier and concluded 30,000 cases are being processed per week.  The figures provided by the Minister of State indicate there were 2,100 in one day.  It could be a bit higher on some days.  Naas alone processes 300 cases.  There are 13 District Courts in Dublin.  Every county in the country outside Dublin has at least one, if not two.  The lists would have between 100 and 300.  Many weeks could see up to 30,000 or more cases going through the courts.  Any of us familiar with the District Court system will know it entails summary justice.  In reality, common sense and practical considerations inform the outcomes more than any complex legal theories.  Experienced judges get the measure of a case in a couple of moments, and often that is all it takes to make the decisions.  However, it is important that cases be processed without delay.  We could have had circumstances in which the system ground to a halt for want of action by the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Waiving pre-legislative scrutiny is not best practice or something we want to do or do regularly.  As the House, including the Minister of State, will be aware, we process almost all items that come before us with due diligence and carry out scrutiny.  While the Davitt decision was a surprise, the High Court appeal, launched from the Circuit Court, was not.  The issue ran for months so there was a period in which to identify the issue.  In a previous role, I worked in a legal department doing what was called horizon scanning.  Part of my role was to consider upcoming legislation, amendments and decisions that might affect the place of work.  The Oireachtas, with all its powers, should have at least one person in a similar role scanning the horizon to see what is coming down the track and to be ready to act quickly when something like the development in question happens.  I grant credit on the grounds that action has been taken quickly through the drafting of legislation, but the Department, rather than putting things on the back foot, should keep an eye on cases like the one in question as they go through so we will not voice these considerations again.  The committee will not grant waivers willy-nilly; it was a special case.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the court presenter has evolved over time, more by accident than by design.  I know a number of court presenters.  They are sergeants.  They are extremely competent in my experience.  Any of the ones I know or have come across perform their duties admirably and honourably.  They are at a remove.  One of the points made about the system is that it is not best practice for the prosecutor to be directly connected to the investigator.  Actually, it is often thought that a criminal court case has a defence against the prosecution.  People who watch US television dramas, etc., see that sort of adversarial conflict.  Of course, there is an adversarial aspect to a case but in the Irish system the prosecutor has the additional duty of ensuring impartiality and independence.  The role overrides everything else and the prosecution has an obligation to put before the court matters that come to its attention, even though they may be detrimental to the prosecution case.  Prosecutors do that.  Along those lines, best practice suggests that because there are obligations, it is not recommended to have the person discharging the prosecution linked directly or indirectly to the investigating force.  Many garda&iacute; carry out the function admirably but it is difficult, even for the best-minded and most skilled and honourable garda&iacute; in the world, to be at a remove from the force they are part of and from their colleagues investigating the crime, who may work in the same station, perhaps at the same desk, on a day-to-day basis. That is an issue.  However, having said that, it would be far worse if every investigating officer had to prosecute his or her own cases, which is what would happen if this legislation was not enacted.  That is what we would have rowed back to.  Instead of having the centralised role of court presenter, every garda would be called in, which would put a strain on Garda resources.  Not only would the logjam in the courts be problematic but there would also be a strain on Garda resources, with garda&iacute; on the beat and on other duties all of a sudden having to attend courts.<\/p>  <p>   It is a matter for another day but we must consider the lack of efficiency in courtrooms if people must sit around for hours waiting for cases to be heard, perhaps with them being adjourned time and again.  Multiple garda&iacute; could be sitting around for multiple days waiting for their five minutes in the sun.  I do not believe any of them would want to do that.  That is best avoided.  It is being avoided through this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  A Policing Authority report, which is published, imminent or expected, makes a recommendation on the degree of independence.  It is recommended that an independent prosecutor, be it a State solicitor, State counsel or otherwise, have a role in the courts.  While the committee waived the pre-legislative scrutiny and I am supporting the expeditious passage of the Bill because of the nature of the situation, this subject deserves revisiting.  The committee may consider it but the Department should do so also.  We should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good in considering the legislation today, but let us not allow an imperfect situation to prevail in the long term either.<\/p>  <p>  While we are focusing on the prosecution today, the defence situation is also far from perfect.  There has been commentary and coverage recently of defence counsel appearing in the District Court.  They are paid a pittance for their time and efforts.  One reason is the legal aid scheme in the District Court does not apply to counsel but only to solicitors.  It is something of an antiquated scheme.  It derives from the days when the District Court had much shorter lists and when a solicitor might have covered two or three matters in a court before lunch, before dealing with conveyancing or something like that in the afternoon.  In reality, with busy practices and expanding suburbs, a Dublin solicitor is not going to spend an entire day looking after one case.  In the Criminal Courts of Justice, for example, a barrister might deal with a number of cases on a given day for different solicitors.  The barrister's role has been developed within the District Court but the system that exists recognises only the role of the solicitor and, therefore, the barrister who takes up the mantle depends on the solicitor to pay him or her afterwards, almost through a back-door system.  It is very confusing.  It is very unfair to those who go down that route.  The natural progression is that those concerned will withdraw their services eventually and move on to other things, and the system will be the poorer for it.  This should be looked into when the District Court system is being considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400026#AA00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1655223600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the Bill.  It is about restoring Garda court presenters and it is more than urgent to pass it.  I want to make a few brief points on it.  We do not always agree here but when there is a matter of urgency, we can come to a gentleman's or lady's agreement.  We do not oppose the Bill.  We accept it and the waiving of the requirement to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny, but as has been raised a number of times on the side of the House, one slight amendment is required.  I ask the Minister of State to take it on board.  If accepted, it would mean the Garda court presenter would not be under the rank of sergeant.  The Minister will have heard other speakers speak about trying to streamline the legislation and say the judgment in the High Court may be an opportunity for us all in this House to work together and consider changing practices within the judicial system.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to streamlining services, the drugs courts and so on were mentioned.  Funnily enough, the mental health committee, at its meeting this morning, dealt with people who are charged with offences under the drugs Act.   Many of these have addiction issues, so maybe there is an alternative to going to court.  Individuals could be victims because of addiction.  Therefore, there are many things we could change in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken to garda&iacute; about this.  We used to have many conversations when we were working in the convention centre.<\/p> <p>We should have more of them on the streets on the beat.  Their frustration is that they are doing all the administrative work even though they are trained to go out and protect the citizens of this country.  It is not happening.  Our amendment is to streamline it and make it specific to working garda&iacute;.  People can do all the theory tests in the world but once we go onto the practical stuff, that is where we need our garda&iacute;, not inside, acting as deputy clerks or anything like that.  I ask the Minister of State to take that amendment on board.  It would be of benefit to moving forward within any part of a judicial review or anything to do with the courts.  Let us get garda&iacute; onto the streets to protect the people they are supposed to serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400026#AA00300","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655224200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I accept this legislation is required.  However, I am not an advocate for rushing legislation through this House.  Although this is probably an exception, we tend to see this prior to a recess.  I hope we are not going to see a whole clatter of things rushed through without adequate scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  The primary legislation should have made provision for court presenters when the strategy was being developed.  It should not have taken a High Court decision to force the justice system to harmonise itself with some basic considerations.  I wonder what consideration there was at the point the strategy was being developed.  Did nobody in the Department think of this aspect?  It may be there are other Bills where we should learn from this shortcoming.<\/p>  <p>  A point I would like to build on is the context of human rights.  The court management office and the court presenters must be cognisant of the position relating to Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in summary, the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time.  Others have talked, for example, about the number of judges.  We are all aware there can be lengthy delays in cases being heard.  If there is any violation of the convention in that regard, the person impacted can seek effective remedy before a national authority, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.<\/p>  <p>  I know cases are being adjourned because the High Court decision means the Garda sergeant court presenters may no longer manage criminal prosecutions in the District Court.  Ms Justice Bolger&rsquo;s overturning of the rule under which a large volume of criminal prosecutions were presented by garda&iacute; unconnected to the original investigation could seriously impact the current efficiencies realised by the use of the court presenters and the functioning of the District Court itself.  This has the potential to lead to breaches of the convention because of delays but the specialised role of the court presenter could also be redundant, meaning garda&iacute; who would be free to cover ground on their rosters will now find themselves coming back and forth to the courts.  We have seen this before.  I remember going past Naas courthouse maybe ten years ago and I would see a whole lot of garda&iacute; outside the court and, at the same time, people were looking for visibility in other respects.  It is very important that there is efficient use of garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  I keep on stating that there is not equality across the country in the deployment of resources.  The more the population grows, the more we stretch those resources, rather than having them added to.  That is very much the case in places such as counties Kildare and Meath, which have the lowest ratio of population to garda&iacute;.  I suspect that when the new census of population comes out, this will be even more acute.<\/p>  <p>  I want to move on to points raised by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The 2018 Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report recommended that the new State Prosecution Service should be tasked with bringing cases to the Courts Service.  The report also views Garda investigations and prosecutions as two separate jobs, as is the case in other comparable jurisdictions.  The report goes further and calls for the immediate cessation of police prosecutions in court because garda&iacute; are not trained to the level of the opposing defence lawyer.  During the High Court case, legal counsel for the DPP and the Garda argued that the revised interpretation of the District Court rules on the right to an audience would result in a fundamental overhaul of the court presenters system operating in the District Court, and that the involvement of garda&iacute; in prosecutions and the time they spend in court or preparing for court is enormously wasteful for police resourcing and they should be deployed to core policing duties.  It would be quite useful to do some sort of a calculation regarding the time involved.  When we consider the resources and we then start taking out things like rosters over whatever number of days and people who are ill or on leave, and we start to look at the actual time available to police areas, the capacity is much less than we might think.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer of court prosecutions to another State department or service has been called for by garda&iacute; themselves, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority.  The Government's implementation plan for the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland stated that a review of prosecution decisions would take place by September 2019 and would be implemented by the summer of 2021.  Instead, in the summer of 2022, we find ourselves having to enshrine poor practice into law because this recommendation has not been acted on in four and a half years.  The Minister of State might outline where he sees that going and what kind of timeframe we are talking about.  The Department of Justice put out a tender only last March to research our procedural system and how it compares to other jurisdictions.  To go beyond the research, is there a timeline in that regard?  The tender document cites the recommendation by the commission and states that it is accepted in principle by the Government, subject to further evaluation, suggesting that this reform, widely acknowledged by all sides as necessary and committed to by this Government and the last, could be sidelined.<\/p>  <p>  The high-level steering group on police reform has yet to make any recommendation to the Government on the prosecution system.  The two interim reports submitted by the group to the Minister for Justice in 2021 have not been published yet.  The Minister of State might tell us if it is intended to publish those and, if so, when.  I ask him to clarify whether there are plans to act on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Are court presenters a stopgap to getting to that point and, if so, will the Minister publish those reports and give us some sort of a timeline on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400027#BB00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1655224200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>This Bill seeks to extend the powers of audience that members of the Garda have before the District Court.  Although it is a very short Bill, its brevity should not disguise the fact there is a very complex and lengthy history to the rights of audience that police officers have had before our courts, particularly for minor offences.  Prior to independence, it was the case that in respect of all minor offences and some indictable offences, members of the RIC - the constabulary - were the people who were able to give evidence before the courts.  The reason they were able to give that evidence was not any statutory power they had but that they had this common law power to give evidence as common informers.  The reason they were common informers was they were members of the public and they were in a position to give this evidence before the court.<\/p> <p>That was a widespread practice before independence.  In fact, it became too widespread and there was criticism of police officers as they then were for effectively becoming advocates before the court.  It was slightly different in Ireland where the law officers encouraged it.  There were statements to members of the RIC that they should examine and cross-examine witnesses and, in effect, be witnesses.  Following independence, all the prosecutorial powers were transferred to the Attorney General of the Irish Free State under the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act 1924.  Section 9 set out how the powers of prosecution were to operate in respect of indictable or serious offences but also in respect of minor offences.  It is clear from section 9(2) that the power of members of the constabulary to prosecute as common informers continued and was transferred over to the new force, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The power for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this new State to prosecute as common informers continued.  It also continued even after the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in 1974.  Even though many offences were prosecuted at the suit of the DPP, and before that the Attorney General of the Irish Free State, predominantly garda&iacute; were prosecuting as common informers.  We got full recognition and a better understanding of that in 1977 in the Supreme Court decision in the case of DPP <i>v<\/i>. Roddy.  Mr. Justice Griffin stated that garda&iacute; who are prosecuting are prosecuting as common informers.  He looked at section 9 of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act 1924 and noted that the power of garda&iacute; to prosecute as common informers had not been removed.  <br\/><br\/>We are here today because of the recent decision of Ms Justice Bolger in the High Court.  It is important we are aware of what happened and why that case was stated to her for her consideration.  It related to a minor drugs prosecution in a District Court.  A garda was prosecuting but the initiating garda who had arrested and brought the case was not in court.  The replacement garda was there and that garda wanted to be able to give evidence if the accused pleaded guilty or wanted the case to be adjourned if that was not the case.  The District Court judge was asked by the solicitor representing the accused whether she would state a case.  She did state a case and that was whether the substitute garda had a right of audience before the District Court in respect of that prosecution.  Ms Justice Bolger answered in the negative and said there was no right of audience.  Her reason was she looked at section 8(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  That legislation in effect removed or codified the common law.  It provided a statutory basis upon which garda&iacute; could prosecute minor offences in the District Court.  That had been recommended by Mr. Justice Griffin in the 1977 case.  However, section 8(2) clearly provides that any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may institute and conduct prosecutions in a court of summary prosecution but only in the name of the DPP.  <br\/><br\/>Sometimes we think we get too worked up about words contained within legislation.  However, we are here today introducing new legislation because the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; was used in that section.  Had the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; been used, we would not be here.  In the case before Ms Justice Bolger, it was argued by the State that the section should be read disjunctively.  That does not make sense because in 2005 when whoever was here used the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, they meant to use the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  Had they meant to use the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; they would have used the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  Those who have read the decision of Ms Justice Bolger will see that she very correctly assessed the language contained within the statute and said that if the Oireachtas was going to be deliberate in changing how prosecutions are done in the District Court, it clearly would have used very precise language.  She rejected the argument put forward by the State that it should be read disjunctively and the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; could be substituted for the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  <br\/><br\/>Obviously that has significant consequences, which is why we are here.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, on bringing forward this legislation so promptly.  It is an example of where legislation needs to be brought forward promptly.  A series of prosecutions are going through the District Court throughout the country at present.  We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where every initiating garda has to be in the District Court on a particular date, otherwise the proceedings will be struck out.  That would be a miscarriage of justice.  <br\/><br\/>We have to go back to what was contained in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It recommended getting the garda&iacute; out of court as much as possible in their capacity as presenters.  Sitting in courtrooms is a waste of time for garda&iacute;, ultimately becoming advocates in the District Court.  None of us wants that.  We want garda&iacute; out on the street fighting crime as opposed to presenting cases.  Garda&iacute; will obviously have to be in court to give evidence as witnesses.  That is different from the issue of court presenter.  I would welcome legislation to give effect to the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We want presenters in court.  We do not want the rules of evidence cut short.  Direct evidence will have to be given by garda&iacute; who spot things on a particular occasion but this legislation is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400027#BB00300","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655224800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an p&iacute;osa reachta&iacute;ochta seo.

It is unfortunate that we have ended up in this situation as it has tied up garda&iacute; who might otherwise be out on the beat.  The Garda court presenter is a well-established position.  Typically it is the local sergeant.  It is important we draw a distinction between garda&iacute; who are called for evidence as Deputy O'Callaghan has done.  That is very different animal from that of the court presenter.  This legislation makes sense.  It is something of an emergency situation and it is being rushed.  We will support it albeit we will table amendments.  The fact that court presenters currently have to be the prosecuting garda&iacute; and that no decision other than the prosecuting garda has a right of audience as things stand means there are garda&iacute; in the courtroom who might better be out on the street.  When training garda&iacute;, which is an expensive and time-consuming job, our focus should be as much as possible to have those skilled people out on the street deterring crime.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there are a few areas in which that is being tied up.  The other relates to the very slow pace of civilianisation, which needs to be expedited.  I recently had a conversation with some senior garda&iacute; in Cork.  There as much as anywhere else we are not seeing enough civilians coming in.  That means garda&iacute; are not out on the street to the extent that they could be.  We need to push that on because many jobs are being done by garda&iacute; that could be done by civilian staff.  That is having an impact on Garda resources on the ground.  <\/p>  <p>  I will again raise the fact that Garda resources in Cork seem to be the poor relation compared with some other urban centres.  It has not had the same intake from Templemore as Dublin, Limerick, Drogheda or some other locations.  That needs to be changed.  I will instance a few areas, in particular Carrigaline, which I have raised often.  Of any large town with more than 10,000 people it has the fourth lowest number of garda&iacute;.  There are only 20 garda&iacute;, which is actually fewer than there was in March, for more than 15,000 people.  The number is very likely higher after the census.  That is one garda for every 800 people in the town.  That just is not good enough.  It is a similar story in other rapidly growing areas such as Douglas, Togher and Ballincollig.  That needs to be addressed.  <\/p>  <p>  From a policing point of view, the Minister of State might bear in mind that Carrigaline has a huge number of young people but the Garda youth diversion project is operating from a rented premises, well supported by the community association and that is welcome.  However, it will ultimately need a permanent location, its own building, for the young population that exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400028#CC00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1655224800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>This is important legislation and I commend the Minister of State on bringing it forward.<\/p> <p>It is only a short Bill.  It is short in implications in terms of what it has to say to us now but it is very important in the way it ties it up.<\/p> <p> It reminds me of the phrase \"and-or\" and an issue the House has discussed in the past, that is, the meaning of \"may\" or \"shall\" in relation to what authority is given in a Bill.  Of course, these words have two distinct and different meanings.  \"May\" means the Minister may or may not, at his or her discretion.  That is a simple interpretation of it.  We have had countless debates in this House as to whether it meant something else and Deputies insisted on the use of the word \"shall\", which compels the Minister or whomever to do what is proposed in the particular Bill or section.  It gives the Minister no options whatever, whereas \"may\" gives him or her options.<\/p> <p> I realise what is proposed in this case.  It is to replace \"institute and conduct\" so that it reads \"institute or conduct\" following the amendment.  That is good.  I accept it will take garda&iacute; out of the courts and put them out on the street.  However, what is important is that the person conducting the proceedings should be familiar with the details of the case.  If that does not happen, difficulties will arise and people may walk when they should not walk or people may be convicted where they should not be convicted.  That is an important definition.  I am aware the Minister of State has studied all of this carefully beforehand and that it has been proofed to the extent necessary.  However, we need to always recognise that there are exceptions to the rule that may arise in different ways and means from time to time.  I mention that for noting at this stage and the Minister of State may have something to say about it.<\/p> <p> In general, the courts work in a satisfactory fashion.  But for the courts, we would be in very serious difficulty.  The only issue I have ever come across is that people who feel aggrieved that the law did not treat them favourably may find themselves equally aggrieved after going to court.  They invariably go back before the courts again and again as lay litigants and they never have their cases resolved.  They are never happy that the ongoing discourse regarding their case never seems to get resolved.  I mention that in the case of people who are deceived in relation to wills and people who inveigle themselves into the confidence of people who are vulnerable and may influence the individual who is vulnerable to the extent that they should not.  Depending on the way the case is dealt with, it may well happen that nothing is done to reverse that situation.  That should occur.  There needs to be an opinion of last resort that examines the victim's situation in a way that gives some solace or recognition that his or her case has been heard.  For example, solicitors will say they know the person is the victim and has been wronged but that is in the past and they cannot do anything about it at that stage.  The Minister of State is an experienced lawyer and I would not like to get into an entanglement with him.  However, I have seen both types of cases overturned, particularly where an injustice was done and the complainant persisted and achieved a result.  In another identical case, in the same way, this was done by a judge interpreting what was put before him or her and saying the complainant had a valid case and the court would deal with it.  There needs to be some reassurance provided for those people who feel wronged.  That also applies in family law cases.<\/p> <p> Family law cases are better dealt with than these cases.  What we see, as public representatives, in cases we have dealt with is that psychologist's reports sought by the court are viewed by the other side as one-sided.  It may be right, accurate or wrong.  It may be as a result of discussions with one party only or as a result of discussions with the two parties, as it should be, but that does not always occur.  On some occasions, decisions have been reached by the courts with far-reaching consequences whereby an aggrieved party becomes highly aggrieved and feels the system is against him or her.  Members of the public need to be reassured in such cases.  I am not agitating for anything other than a discussion on that issue at some stage in the future in this House.  There are many such cases.  Everybody knows about them and we have all tried to resolve them in one way or another.  I hope we can do that.<\/p> <p> I hope this particular amendment does not run into flak - no pun intended - and serves its purpose.  I hope it achieves fair and even-handed handing out of justice in the courts.<\/p> <p> Everybody goes to court to get justice but justice does not necessarily come.  Justice is viewed from the perspective of the person seeking it and sometimes what people get is the law.  The two are not always the same thing.  I will leave it at that.  I hope the legislation will work well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400028#CC00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655225400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is not an ideal way to process legislation but it is important that we are dealing with it as the alternative would be chaos.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill.  We have tabled an amendment to ensure that Garda court presenters are not below the rank of sergeant.  This allows prosecuting garda&iacute; to focus on serious crime in higher courts.  Garda&iacute; need to be utilised in an efficient and effective way.  They play such an important role in communities across the country and the last thing we need is garda&iacute; tied up in court when they could be utilised more effectively.<\/p>  <p>  The same applies when garda&iacute; are tied up, as mentioned previously, doing desk duties and endless paperwork when they could be out doing the jobs they are particularly good at.  The amount of paperwork garda&iacute; have to do is madness.  The amount of time a simple statement takes makes no sense in an era of technology.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; need to be working with communities and they need to be resourced to do so.  A concrete example of the lack of Garda resources in the south inner city is that Pearse Street Garda station does not have a minibus to work with community groups.  Pearse Street Garda station is one of the busiest stations in the country, yet it does not have a minibus.  This means the engagement between garda&iacute; and the local community is limited.  The work community garda&iacute; do is crucial when it comes to dealing with young people and keeping them engaged in society in a positive way.  In many ways, as I have mentioned in the House previously, the Mulvey report has divided the city.  It has divided the north inner city community from the south inner city community.  They are effectively one community but the Mulvey report has divided it to a point where the north inner city has significant resources to work with communities.  On the southside, however, Pearse Street Garda station does not have a minibus to work with local communities.  That is a reflection of the lack of the required resources in the inner city.  I have said previously that the findings of the Mulvey report should be mirrored on the south inner city.<\/p> <p>Again, this is an important Bill and we support it, with an amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400029#DD00200","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655226000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Deputies Berry and Shanahan are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400030#EE00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1655226000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion of this Bill.  I fully recognise its importance and the urgency associated with it.  I take on board as well the points that have been raised by other Deputies.  There are two ways of looking at it.  First, we would all prefer to not to be here discussing very detailed legislation at short notice with a tight, time-sensitive horizon.  The other way of looking at it is that this is probably a good example of two arms of the State, namely, the Judiciary and the Legislature, working in unison but independently to ensure that we have the best law possible.<\/p><p>In general terms I support the Bill.  I am supportive of it for five reasons primarily.  First, if it is not broke, do not fix it.  The current system works well.  As the Minister of State alluded to, it is well established.  It is well respected, both by victims and by the accused.  It is important to bear in mind that the judge, when she made her ruling last week, did not raise any problems with the principle of a court presenter.  The issue was with the administrative technicality associated with it.  I am glad that this Bill will tie up that administrative technicality.<\/p><p>My second point is that from a law perspective, as a general rule, it is not good to have ambiguity or grey areas.  This House should seize any opportunity it has to tie up or to clarify points of law.  This is a good example of this and it is a good opportunity to do that.  We should grab it with both hands.<\/p><p>The third point is that garda&iacute; do not work as individuals, but as teams.  We need to appreciate that.  I do not see any difficulty whatsoever with one particular court presenter handing over key information in relation to a case and to allow a second or even a third court presenter to continue with the case, to present it and to prosecute before the courts system.<\/p><p>Fourth, what we are proposing will make the courts system more efficient.  All it will do is bring us back to the <i>status quo, <\/i>to where we were last week.  However, it is unreasonable to expect that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should always be inside the courts.  This will make the courts system more efficient.  In the event that a garda is injured, ill, or if, as we saw only a couple of weeks ago, their house is broken into by criminals, if they are on a course, or if they are annual leave, the court system can continue without an adjournment or without a delay.<\/p><p>Fifth, and most importantly, I am supporting this Bill because I recognise that if it is not passed shortly it will prejudice the outcomes and will delay a number of cases that are already before the courts.  In summary, I support the Bill for the reasons that I outlined.  I look forward to its passage through the D&aacute;il and to its swift implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400030#EE00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1655226000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>The principle of garda court presenters means that any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can institute and can conduct prosecutions in a court of summary jurisdiction in the name of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As Members have already said, the system has been well represented, well established and has been working efficiently.  For many within the District Court prosecutions, the legal basis for garda court presenters being well understood ensures that garda&iacute; would not be taken off the beat because they are required to present in court to conduct their own prosecutions on every summons that they initiate.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendment has been recognised as required due to a recent High Court ruling at the end of May.  The High Court found against the State, requiring that a prosecuting garda must be present in court to progress the case that he or she initiated.  Such a finding, if left unamended, would completely disrupt the courts, as has been suggested.  Therefore, I as a member of the Regional Group, will be welcoming the amendment.  It is important to close out this legal loophole.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak for a few minutes about the actions of garda&iacute;, as opposed to the courts, as well as about the difficult job they have in trying to integrate with the court system and to process their own work.  We have significant challenges now across the State, not least of which are the increased challenges of anti-social behaviour, drug abuse, criminal theft and damage, attacks upon the person and attacks upon garda&iacute;.  Many of those who are accused in the courts of serious crimes are availing of legal aid.  I would say that there is an overly accommodative stance in terms of sentencing regimes.  It is probably to do with the difficulties with the lack of prison accommodation.  However, it is a fact - it has been made public quite a number of times - that there are many people walking around with multiple convictions.  They should basically be in a custodial situation and they are not.  They are coming up time and again before the courts.  This is very challenging for garda&iacute; to be seeing these people out and about when they are trying to prosecute them in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the discretion that was available, particularly to community and regional garda&iacute;, has been withdrawn in recent years.  The result is now that more minor prosecutions are being activated.  For many in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are admonished to ensure that the letter of the law is applied without cognisance of the spirit to which it was intended.  This is something that the Minister of State needs to have a look at.  It is having a detrimental effect in garda community liaison engagement.  It is obstructive to building the relationships that community and garda&iacute; need to facilitate and to share a relationship and information, particularly of information that would expedite the solving of less serious crimes.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of expediting court appearances, we now have a significant problem in the State where summonses are going out and they are not being picked up by An Post.  People are not at the addresses that they are being sent to.  We have over and over deferral of cases.  If you look at air travel at the moment, it is ubiquitous that everybody is getting their boarding cards through their phones.  People have no problem accessing travel documents through their phones all the time.  The Minister of State needs to look at some integrating technology now that summonses can be issued by means of mobile phones and emails.  This would do much to speed up the activities in the courts, to make sure that summons are served and to ensure that people are deemed to have been served. <\/p>  <p>  I also want to mention the issues of my own Garda station, which is now the divisional headquarters for the south east in Waterford.  I raised this in the House with the Minister of State some months ago.  I was happy in recent days to attend a community engagement down there.  It was attended by all of the rescue services and ambulance services in the area.  That is only right because Waterford, as the Minister of State probably knows, serves over 12 counties for all areas of emergency, including 999 calls and air-sea rescue.  They co-ordinate everything there.  As I said to the Minister of State before, there is not room to swing the proverbial cat inside that barracks building.  It has had no expansion and no capital development for the past 20 years, even though it has now been designated as a divisional headquarters.  More people are due to go into it.  More people from the private sector are due to work there.  There is no room for these people.  There is no room for the members to put their bags.  There are very few lockers.  I ask the Minister of State again to liaise with the Department of Justice, the Commissioner and the OPW to find the long-requested funding for this barracks.  I understand that a capital footprint and a design plan of &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million was given to the Department.  I ask the Minister of State to resource that so that members there can do their jobs efficiently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400030#EE00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1655226000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I also welcome the chance to speak on the Bill.  The importance of the Bill, brief though it may be, cannot be overstated.  It seeks to address the findings in Liam Varley <i>v<\/i>. Ciar&aacute;n Davitt that there is no legal basis underpinning the system of garda court presenters at District Court level.  This effectively means that no garda, other than the prosecuting garda, has the right of audience in respect of a case.  Needless to say, an irregularity of this type can have profound consequences in dealing with crime or with similar matters in a timely, effective way.  The consequence of this may not just impact on dealing with cases promptly, but can also impact on faith in the system.<\/p><p>We hear much of dissatisfaction with prosecutions.  Not addressing this adequately would only add to these concerns.  The High Court decision made an immediate impact on District Court cases.  We saw postponements in May and June.  This, effectively, was a postponement on the delivery of justice.  Not addressing this gap in legislation can also result in areas where depleted Garda numbers can be reduced further by requiring a specific member of the force to appear in court.  When Garda duties are taken up in court and numbers are shorter on the ground a system that does not allow any garda, other than their prosecuting garda, to have an audience in respect of a case further restricts the ability of our Garda to operate as effectively as they wish on the ground in our communities.<\/p><p>Take Tipperary, for instance.  As of the end of last year, we had a total of 398 garda&iacute;.  This is down from 411 a year earlier and is only three more than was the case back in 2009.  In my view, we must be mindful of time management and of the prompt working of justice.  That is why as a party Sinn F&eacute;in agreed not to object to the waiver of the pre-legislative scrutiny on the Oireachtas committee on justice without sight of the Bill.  However, it now appears that there is a shortcoming in the Bill that would have unintended consequences that could impinge upon the effective prosecution of a case.<\/p> <p>As the Bill is worded, it would see probationary garda&iacute; being given the ability to act as court presenters, which would have consequences that are of particular concern.  Na Teachta&iacute; Martin Kenny and Daly have submitted an amendment to rectify this and ensure Garda court prosecutors are not below the rank of sergeant.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the opportunity to speak on these proposals, which have potential ramifications for every community in my constituency of Tipperary and all across the country.  We need legislation that deals effectively with the matters that impact on communities the most.  We also need to ensure Garda numbers are sufficient to meet the current needs of communities with as much urgency as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400030#EE00500","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655226600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy O'Donoghue.  I am pleased to speak broadly in support of this Bill.  At the Business Committee and in subsequent communications, we agreed to progress this legislation as a matter of urgency.  There is an old saying that justice delayed is justice denied.  The Minister of State, as a practitioner of the law, understands the problems that arise from delays.  There are many reasons for those delays.  The backlogs in all the courts, particularly in Circuit Court sittings, are enormous.  It could take seven, eight or even ten years before some Circuit Court cases are held.  That type of predicted longevity is not good.<\/p>  <p>  I am not hung up on the question of whether a garda acting as a court presenter must be a sergeant, as proposed in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, but I would say any participating garda should, obviously, have some relevant experience of the court system.  One gets that experience by learning and participating in the Courts Service.  T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre.  Any time I have been at court sittings, I have seen several members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na waiting and waiting, whatever the delays are, and perhaps not being called at all in the end.  It is a complete and utter waste of Garda time.  I am all for proper, fair and speedy justice.  However, as Deputy Durkan noted, one might not always get the justice one expects from the justice system, or it might not be justice at all in one's eyes, and it is frightfully expensive for those who have to pay to access it.  I will speak about the free legal aid system presently.<\/p>  <p>  It is not acceptable to have ten or 12 garda&iacute; attending court sittings when they have so many other duties to deal with in communities.  In the division in my area, especially in the Cahir-Cashel district, the Garda numbers were never as low as they are now.  I salute the community garda&iacute; there, who are brilliant.  Sergeant Ray Moloney, who has now moved on, was top class, as are the team members, Garda Jenny Gough and Garda Judy Davern.  Last Friday, we had the launch of the amalgamation of two schools in Cahir into a new building, which has been 35 years or longer in the planning.  It was wonderful to see Garda Kevin McGuinness of the traffic corps, Garda Davern and Garda Gough there, led by a piper.  Pupils from the two schools came together in what is known as the old convent yard, which is now a day care centre, and walked the almost half a mile to the new building.  There was great excitement and it was lovely that the garda&iacute; were able to give the safety of an escort, led by the piper, to the new school, Bunscoil na Cathrach.  It was a momentous day.  The new school will have some 380 pupils, although the children in sixth class will only have a couple of weeks there before moving on.  The project has come to completion under the stewardship of the principal, Mr. Horan.<\/p>  <p>  It is great to have local garda&iacute; available for events like that.  I know that some of them, including in this case, come into work when they are not on duty.  In many areas, they don the uniform and do that kind of work.  They are with the people, for the people and they stand with the people.  No police force in the word can police without the support of the people.  It is a two-way street.  Community garda&iacute; get down and dirty with the people, visiting them and getting involved in community-focused events, including community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes.  The new property marking scheme, which will be starting in my village shortly, with the assistance of former members of Muintir na T&iacute;re and our own SOLAS team, is a very good initiative.<\/p>  <p>  The free legal aid service must be reformed.  Why does it take so long to introduce reform to such schemes by way of legislation?  I am all for free legal aid for people who are not able to afford the defence under the justice system to which they are entitled in any democratic society.  However, I also am in favour of three strikes and you are out.  I am not for a revolving door situation whereby people can come back for free legal aid umpteen times.  In some cases, individuals have received it 15 or 16 times.  They are milking the system.  Legal practitioners, too, must take a share of the blame for this revolving system.  The victims are lost in all of this.  We have a victims' charter and everything else but we have been very slow to support victims.  I once helped a family in a case involving a heinous murder.  The family members were trying to find out when the person who was convicted would be getting out and possibly returning to the locality.  There is no follow-through from the justice system in supporting the families of loved ones whose lives have been taken away and who have been swept from them.<\/p>  <p>  Huge reforms are needed.  This Bill deals with only one of those reforms, arising from a ruling by the High Court that the prosecuting garda must be the garda who investigated the offence and issued the summons.  That will require more and more garda&iacute; to attend court sittings and the waste of time involved is shocking.  I am not saying the current system should be diminished in any way.  We have competent garda&iacute; to perform this duty and it is normally experienced members who do so.  However, having such a large number of garda&iacute; held up is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  I have to mention Clonmel Garda station.  I referred to the amalgamation of the schools in Cahir that took 30 or 40 years to achieve.  The issue with the Garda station in Clonmel has been going on for 50 or 60 years.  We have planning permission and a wonderful design for a brand new station and a site has been found.  The project was included in different packages and bundles of stations all over the country, including Sligo, Clonakilty and others.  There has been change after change, the latest of which was a gigantic one.  Garda&iacute; in Clonmel, under the leadership of Superintendent Willie Leahy, as well as Chief Superintendent Derek Smart in Thurles, have been left bewildered.  The design was done and we accepted we were in a bundle with two or three other stations.  We understood there would be contractors appointed to build the Garda stations.  Now, however, the station has been locked into a tripartite arrangement with the children's court.  In my experience - Deputy O'Donoghue has a lot more experience than I do in this area - there are specialised builders who work on court buildings, which normally are very stately buildings with a very finessed finish.  I am not saying Garda stations should be any less stately but they are, pardon the phrase, a different animal.<\/p>  <p>  We are concerned that this will lead to further undue delays and prevarications.  The Minister for Justice visited two weeks ago and saw the state of the station, as have several of her predecessors, as well as the Taoiseach.  It is Dickensian and shameful.  We can no longer expect our garda&iacute; to give a service to the public from such a building.  It is not acceptable for the public to have to access it.  It is just not fit for purpose.  The building is leased from the county council, which wants it back for many reasons.  As I said, a lovely site has been found, on the location of the old Kickham Barracks, planning permission has been granted and the design and everything else is ready to go.  The station should not be bundled with any part of the Courts Service.  We have accepted being bundled with other Garda stations around the country.  When it comes to tendering for projects, different skill sets are needed for court buildings, requiring different architects and everything else.  As I understand it, the court project is not even at design stage.  If I am wrong on that, the Minister of State will correct me.  The new arrangement is not good enough for the people of Clonmel and south Tipperary and it is not good enough for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na there.  It cannot be allowed to carry on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400031#FF00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1655226600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I agree with most of what is contained in it except for the provision whereby a trainee garda may be called on to present in court.  I do not agree with that.  Any garda who does so must have experience in that field.  That is my one concern.  I welcome anything that will free up Garda resources.  There are many areas around the country in which garda&iacute; are needed but are being held up for days and weeks participating in court cases.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Often court cases are suspended, when a few days were offered.  That takes resources from our local communities.  We must invest in the Garda and in technology for the force to combat the type of crime existing now.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs major investment in technology.  The required technology is there but it is not being used.  For our Garda services to be at their best, even though we have depleted numbers, there must be a great deal of investment in our Garda stations.  Taking the example of Newcastle West in my own district of Limerick, for three years the Garda station was closed to allow for the building of a new one.  Yet that Garda station has not been built.  We do not have a headquarters in west Limerick.  All I hear every time I mention this is that the matter is being looked into and someone will get back to us.  It goes to show what types of things are happening.  If it was in Dublin or Cork, that headquarters would have been built.  When it is in west Limerick though, the Government seems to think we can wait for years to have this project completed.  We all need our headquarters in our areas.<\/p> <p> The Garda does a hard job.  It is one I could not do myself.  Garda&iacute; leave their families and put their lives on the line.  They do not know what they are going to face in any part of the day.  Therefore, out of respect for the Garda and for the work the members of the force do, I thank them for everything they do in trying to keep us safe.  Investment, though, must come from the Government.  The Garda must be provided with the proper equipment, vehicles, technology and premises to allow the members of the force to carry out their work.  They do fantastic work in communities.  When we have enough garda&iacute; to allow it, they engage with younger people.  They try everything they can to help the younger generation growing up to ensure those young people can say a garda is a person you can turn to when in trouble or in need of help.<\/p> <p> As I said, we have depleted numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is hoped those numbers will rise in the next couple of years.  I believe 1,800 people were called for an interview.  I think they are at No. 200 now in the context of the interviews.  I welcome this.  I also welcome people applying to go for an interview and wanting to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is no point in having a Garda service, however, if the investment is not there in the premises, the technology and the vehicles required.  Equally, we also need numbers.  Therefore, I welcome what is in the Bill.  I do not agree with a requirement for a sergeant to be involved in this context.  I do not believe it has to be a sergeant.  A competent garda with experience would suffice, but not a trainee garda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400031#FF00300","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655227200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>We understand the basis of this Bill stems from a recent High Court judgment in which it was determined that the system of Garda court presenters had no legal basis.

We recognise the importance of establishing Garda court presenters on a formal legal basis.  This is why we did not oppose a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill by the Joint Committee on Justice.

Obviously, it has been well reported in the media that the High Court struck down the existing practice, or at least found it lacked a lawful basis.  We are now proposing to introduce this system on exactly such a basis.  I am convinced it is a considerable waste of Garda time not to have a presenting officer.  I am not convinced at all, however, that a return to the <i>status quo<\/i>is not an equal waste of Garda time.  We have this great habit in Ireland of commissioning reports.  The Minister of State's Department, apart from the Department of Health, is probably one of the main culprits contributing to global warming in this fashion by commissioning reports.  I refer to all the energy it takes to compile a report and then to print and publish it so that it can then sit on a shelf.  Even more energy is probably used then because it likely gets dusted every once in a while.  These reports remain on the shelf, though, and nothing happens with them.<\/p><p>We have a report, The future of Policing in Ireland, about which there was much fanfare at the time.  It was published in September 2018 and recommended that this idea of a presenting officer be abolished and replaced with a national prosecutorial service or an extension of the existing State Solicitor's office.  The report recommended that all &quot;decisions should be taken away from the police and given to an expanded state solicitor or national prosecution service&quot;.  I refer to decisions on whether to prosecute and the prosecutions themselves.  The report also noted the &quot;Garda&iacute; in charge of prosecutions may not be trained to the level of the opposing defence lawyer[s]&quot;.  This might have been something the Minister of State encountered himself when he was in the District Court.  It was also noted in the report that, &quot;Some Garda&iacute; have undoubtedly become skilful prosecutors through experience, but this should not be their job and it does not justify taking them away from front line duties.&quot;<\/p><p>This is the most important point in this context.  If we have garda&iacute; who are, essentially, prosecutors, then they are not out policing in the community.  We have other people who are trained as prosecutors and who go through universities etc. to become prosecutors.  Those people could easily be carrying out that function.  Garda&iacute;, of course, also have extensive and specialist training they cannot use because they are doing a job they are not trained to do.  The idea behind this Bill is we are going to save Garda time by, essentially, wasting more Garda time until we get to the point of being able to draft a Bill that will save Garda time.  That is a bit convoluted.  It is a convoluted way of saying this Bill seems to be a waste of time and we are going to end up back where we were, which is not where we wanted to be, but this is happening because the court decision was made more quickly than was anticipated.  It is a case of what is another year of waiting for a report to be enacted in the Minister of State's Department.<\/p><p>Before the recess, we brought in legislation that rolled over emergency measures to allow people to drink outdoors.  We are only doing that, of course, until the consolidated legislation comes in when we will deal with it all.  Everyone had a great chuckle in here, however, about when that might be.  People guffawed and agreed we would probably never see that legislation.  Therefore, we continue with this farce that it will just be one more piece of legislation that will be rolled over annually.  This Bill is in that vein.  Contrary to what is being claimed, this Bill is going to continue the practice we have referred to.  It is not one that is necessarily wasting Garda time <i>per se<\/i>, because the role being carried out by those members of the force as prosecuting officers is necessary and better than the alternative that would exist after the High Court judgment in the absence of proper amending legislation, which would see numerous garda&iacute; having to go to court to give the evidence that one presenting officer could do.  It is, however, still not a solution.<\/p><p>It is four years after The Future of Policing in Ireland report was duly received by the Minister of State's predecessors in the Department and the by the then Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I presume there was some fanfare and that someone got photographed with the report and that it was a great day out.<\/p> <p> However, at some point it could be about amending the legislation and system.  Apart from the waste of Garda time, there is a further problem with the fact that the presenting officers are garda&iacute;.  It leads to an impression one might have, if one came from another jurisdiction, that these are Garda courts rather than independent courts because garda&iacute; are making a decision on whether to prosecute and garda&iacute; present evidence, as opposed to merely giving evidence of what they have seen or what their policing duties were.  Rather, they are in uniform as garda&iacute;.  There might have been a time when it was intended that they might look like Garda courts, but we have moved beyond that in the administration of justice.  Certainly, most countries have done so.  We are almost unique in retaining this system.  More serious consideration needs to be given to this and a more profound change needs to be introduced than that which the Bill proposes.<\/p> <p> I want to discuss how we do justice in Ireland.  I want bring up a decision of the Garda ombudsman, relating to a protected disclosure under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The Act is an unusual creature because if a protected disclosure is made to any of the various Government Departments, guidelines are to be issued.  There is an expectation that there would be an investigation into the subject matter of the protected disclosure.  In this instance, a former member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na made a number of rather disturbing complaints.  One related to a prosecution in the Special Criminal Court.<\/p> <p> We will, of course, come to the Special Criminal Court in about a week's time in the House and it will be put up to us to again roll over the legislation.  We had a committee chaired by a former member of the Supreme Court and former Attorney General, no less.  In those circumstances, it might be expected to be somebody who would have a fair understanding of how the prosecution of serious offences works and the risks inherent in not having the possibility of non-jury courts.  Nevertheless, the committee found that in respect of the operation of the Special Criminal Court, the fact that one could not challenge a decision of the DPP to refer the matter to the Special Criminal Court was legally problematic.  His judgment was borne out because it has been subsequently criticised by various UN tribunals over the years.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding all of that, including the reports, the commissioning of a report and the report being published, here we are.  I believe there is another independent body.  If one does not like the first independent body, one can get another one.  When Deputy Charlie Flanagan was Minister for Justice, the votes were looking tight at one point before Sinn F&eacute;in decided it would abstain on this issue.  He was going to commission another independent body to examine the court, which gave Sinn F&eacute;in the opportunity to abstain.  I have not heard about the report since, but I presume there are independent experts driving around the country and maybe even taking evidence.  God love us if they are taking evidence, because why would anybody waste his or her time giving evidence to a group like that knowing what happened to the last independent group?  When it came up with a recommendation that the Department of Justice minions did not like, the report was filed with all of the other reports, including the report on policing we are discussing today.<\/p> <p> The case I refer to concerned the prosecution of two subversives, as they would have been called then.  They might now be called politicians.  Nevertheless, my objection to the Special Criminal Court does not change depending on who is being tried or how one views their offences; the principle is that people are not able to challenge the decision to try them there.  Two persons were apprehended in Clare and prosecuted in respect of a bank robbery.  The garda to whom I refer made a protected disclosure that he took a statement from a witness.  The accused were found guilty in the Special Criminal Court.  <\/p> <p> The garda alleged that the statement used in court was a very different one from the one he took, and involved the use of marked notes in a bank robbery.  Essentially, the two people concerned were accused of stealing money to fund the activities of the IRA.  A witness gave evidence to this particular garda that she could not say that there were any marked notes or could not identify the marked notes in question.  She was interviewed by a subsequent garda and changed her mind.  This evidence was part, but very far from all, of the evidence which was adduced against the accused in the Special Criminal Court, and who were subsequently found guilty.<\/p> <p> The garda who gave the evidence was involved in the Shergar investigation.  As the House will be aware, a certain amount of ransom money was put in a boot of a car and subsequently went missing.  While &pound;80,000 is still a lot of money, it was a vast sum of money in the 1980s in Ireland.  The official Garda line would suggest there is very little cover for all of this.  A branch of Ulster Bank was opened and &pound;80,000 was taken from it.  All of this happened without the involvement of any senior management, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was led to believe.<\/p> <p> Money went missing and somebody had to carry the can.  One garda was fired.  Disciplinary proceedings were brought against him and he was found guilty on the majority of charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400032#GG00300","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655227800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Does this relate to the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400033#HH00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1655227800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>This relates to the need for profound reform of the legislation governing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, rather than putting another sticking plaster over what is increasingly a festering wound.<\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner appointed somebody to investigate the case and it was subsequently found that somebody had been procured to give evidence against the garda concerned.  All of this was brought to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Having looked at the case, it determined that, as regards the evidence against the persons being tried in the Special Criminal Court, there was other evidence against them and they were legally represented at the time.  With regard to the garda's evidence, it was found to be his opinion, the evidence of somebody else, the effluxion of time and all that.  It culminated in a decision, taking all of these matters into consideration, that GSOC was of the view that it was not desirable in the public interest to investigate the allegations under the 2005 Act.<\/p><p>Desirability in the public interest is unique to disclosures made to the Garda ombudsman.  If it is not in the public interest to investigate corruption in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the doctoring of evidence and the singling out of somebody to carry the can, if only to find that everything was being done properly, what is the public interest?  Is there no public interest whatsoever?  GSOC, as a matter of public record, is very badly funded and unable to carry out its functions, but I understand it has a number of public interests to satisfy and may be tasked with doing a loaves and fishes operation.  However, it is important for the integrity of policing in Ireland that a light is shone on all aspects of policing, including matters that occurred some time ago.  If we do not look properly at what happened some time ago, how can anybody have confidence in what is happening today?<\/p><p>This Bill is yet another sticking plaster from the Department of Justice.  There is very little legislation going through the House at the moment.  I do not know why that is, and I have raised this issue on previous occasions.  We could have come up with something a little more profound than that which is in this Bill.  Essentially, we are trying to preserve a <i>status quo<\/i>which we have accepted is inadequate.  That is a ridiculous proposition for the Minister to bring to the House.<\/p> <p>We know the situation is inadequate, and we have had only four years to come up with an alternative.  Now the courts have struck down the situation, which we have already accepted is not really up to scratch, but the Government will provide a legal basis to carry on this operation nonetheless.  To use a colloquialism, it could be considered whistling past the graveyard.  You know when you have the awful sense that things are not really going the way you want them to go?  The Government will just keep going for another little while and pretend it is all right.  It is not.<\/p> <p> We need proper legislation.  There is a much more detailed Garda Bill going through the Houses - very slowly, it has to be said.  The heads of that Bill were examined by the Committee on Justice at some point last winter, and I have not seen it come to Second Stage yet.  That legislation mirrors large pieces of the existing legislation.  Major discretion is afforded to the Garda Commissioner.  In particular, that legislation mirrors the idea that certain matters will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice in order that he or she - at the moment, of course, we have a female Minister for Justice, which is very much to be welcomed - be kept informed of matters that may be of interest to him or her.  There was the Phil Hogan incident whereby the Minister was informed of the fact he had been apprehended with a mobile phone to his ear while driving.  It is a long way from the prosecution of people in the Special Criminal Court for bank robberies to raise funding for subversives.  It might be of interest to a Minister for Justice to know exactly what is going on in the country or to know that somebody - a political opponent, perhaps, or a thorny political personage - was driving around while carrying a mobile phone.  That is political policing, really, and we are to continue with that on the Statute Book without any overhaul of the laws that govern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> All of that, of course, leads to a lack of confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na among the population and a lack of confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management among lower ranking officers, which is a very big problem.  Bringing in sticking-plaster legislation in order that we can still have presenting officers in the District Court is not the answer and not what we need.  It marks a very disappointing lack of ambition on the part of the Department of Justice - not, I should say, the civil servants in the Department of Justice because it is for Ministers, senior and junior, to lead the Department of Justice.  I do not see a whole lot of leadership there at the moment.  On that basis I will oppose the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400033#HH00300","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655228400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I acknowledge the Committee on Justice for providing a pre-legislative scrutiny waiver in respect of this matter due to its urgency.  I take Deputy Martin Kenny's point that where a committee waives pre-legislative scrutiny, perhaps a technical briefing could be provided to spokespersons.  I will bring that point back to the Department and the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  Currently, court presenters in Dublin are generally sergeants and, outside of Dublin, are generally at a rank higher than sergeant, often at inspector level.  The relevant court presenters are given very specific training as well.  I am not aware of any situation in which someone below the rank of sergeant has acted as a court presenter.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is not minded to accept Sinn F&eacute;in's proposed amendment.  I acknowledge its worthiness but, given this is emergency legislation, we simply do not have the time to ensure there are no unintended consequences, no matter how obvious the circumstances may be.<\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of the emergency legislation is to restore the system of court presenters that existed prior to the High Court judgment.  There has been insufficient time to ensure there would be no unintended consequences by adopting any alternative approach at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, in April 2021 the general scheme of the policing, security and community safety Bill was approved by the Government and published.  The scheme provides that the Bill, when enacted, will repeal the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, in its entirety.  Head 9 of the scheme provides for the prosecution of offences by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is necessary to restate the existing law as set out in section 8 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, pending the report of the high-level review group on the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the public prosecution system and its consideration by the Government.  The review group is due to submit its final report within a matter of weeks.  Consideration of the group's recommendation is linked to the final report of the review group and its consideration by the Government in due course.  Nothing in this Bill should pre-empt the work of the group, and that has informed the approach to the emergency legislation for consideration today.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully recognise the emergency legislation, as proposed, is significant, I believe this Bill represents a necessary, proportionate and carefully balanced response to the current situation and would allow the District Court to function as intended.  Further, the legislation comes in response to an emergency, whereby failure to act would deny access to the District Court for accused persons and victims, incur greater costs on the State and prolong the period of uncertainty for all involved.  Consideration is being given to appealing the judgment.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing from Deputies on the matter on subsequent Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400034#JJ00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655228400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1655228400,"counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400034#JJ00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1655228400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn - to discuss pre-legislative scrutiny of legislation for a defective concrete blocks scheme;

and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has made a commitment in its Programme for Government: Our Shared Future to ensure that each child with a special educational need has an appropriate school place, in line with their Constitutional right;  <\/blockquote>further notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; there has been an inexcusable failure by the Minister for Education and Deputy Josepha Madigan, Minister of State at the Department of Education to make adequate preparations to provide appropriate school places to children with special educational needs;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; many parents have been put in a desperate position due to a lack of Government planning and may feel pressured to accept inappropriate places in special education centres or otherwise, as they feel they have no other choice for their child;  <\/blockquote>furthermore notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the 13-step process of compelling schools to open special units under section 37A of the Education Act, 1998, far from an emergency response, is incredibly arduous and time-consuming; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the announcement from Deputy Josepha Madigan, Minister of State at the Department of Education that she will now begin to issue notices under section 37A of the Education Act, 1998 is unlikely to ensure that schools will open special units by this September, given the timing set out in the Act to undertake the 13-step process; and <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; publish the data they hold on the true number of children with special educational needs who do not have an appropriate school place for September 2022; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; bring forward emergency legislation to expedite the section 37A process, ensuring special units in schools who receive these notices will be ready for September; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; give a clear statement that the segregationist proposal of special education centres will not go ahead; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; recommit to ensuring that all children with special educational needs have an appropriate school place within a school community by September 2022; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; undertake a review and appropriate forward-planning before the end of 2022, to ensure that we are not again faced with children with special educational needs without an appropriate school place in summer 2023. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>This motion calls for emergency measures from the Government to ensure every child has an appropriate school place - I emphasise the word &quot;appropriate&quot; - this September.  It is disgraceful we have got to the point of having to resort to emergency measures at all.  Education provision, particularly for children with special educational needs, should never be an emergency, yet year on year families across the State face a summer of stress not knowing whether their children will have schools to go to in September.  Every year is the same, with no action on the part of the Government or the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, throughout the course of the school year followed by panic stations every May and June.  This year is no different.<\/p> <p>There are no excuses that the Minister, Deputy Foley, or the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, can make for the Government's failure to prepare.  It was repeatedly warned this year and last year by parents of children with special educational needs, disability advocacy groups, Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  <\/p> <p> A survey released by AsIAm last week found that at least 267 students did not have an appropriate school place for September 2022.  In reality, that number is significantly higher.  That does not include the thousands of children whose parents, desperate and feeling that they had no other choice, accepted an inappropriate place for their child.  <\/p> <p> One parent told me this week that she and her partner were awake at night worrying about putting their son into an unsuitable mainstream class of 30 children in September with a teacher who is not trained in special education, as they have no other option.  That is not the fault of the teacher.  The couple's son should not be in that class.  It is devastating for families that the lack of planning and action from the Government has left parents with their backs to the wall, accepting completely inappropriate school places because they feel they have no choice and home provision on other occasions.<\/p> <p> The Ministers have access to the information on the true number of children who need a school place in September.  They have the budget and the power to intervene and resolve this.  Their failure to act is unacceptable.  The announcement at the eleventh hour that they will now begin the process of issuing section 37A notices is a day late and a dollar short.  This is a 13-step process.  It will take months to complete all of the steps as they currently stand.  Meanwhile, we have only two weeks of the primary school year left.<\/p> <p> Parents I have spoken to are greatly worried that it will be October or even November before these additional class places are open for their child.  Families were understandably hurt and, frankly, angered by the proposal that was floated of segregated centres of education, segregating and isolating children from their peers into special education centres rather than as part of the school community.  One has to wonder how this proposal came to be in the first place.  There is clearly a lack of communication within the Department, with the Fine Gael Minister of State with responsibility for special education announcing this special education proposal and the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Education briefing the media that she had concerns over the implications for inclusion and immediately turning around to tell her party that it would not come about.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are tasked with working together with the National Council for Special Education and schools on the ground to ensure that all children have an appropriate school place.  It seems the two Ministers in the Department are not even talking properly to each other about how best to resolve this.  If that is indicative of the lack of poor planning, communication and dysfunction in the Department, is it any wonder that we are in this crisis at the eleventh hour?  The mixed messages coming from the Department are incredibly difficult for any family to navigate but I imagine even more so for families of children with special educational needs who have English as a second language.<\/p> <p> The Ministers know the number of children affected and what school places they need.  I am urging them both to publish the data they hold on the number of children who do not have an appropriate place, give a clear statement that this segregationist, isolationist proposal of centres of special education will not be implemented and publish emergency legislation to expedite the section 37A process.  More than that, because it is not enough to solve the issue for this September as we rush to do what we can to resolve that particular problem, we must ensure this is not repeated and that, instead, decisions about this matter are taken as far out from the beginning of the school year as possible.  That needs to happen for 2023.  The NCSE needs to get its act together on data and planning but so do the Ministers.<\/p> <p>This is about the potential of children and them having the ability to best reach that potential.  To do so, they need an appropriate school place, as is their constitutional entitlement, and I urge the Ministers to give them that constitutional entitlement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400034#JJ00700","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655229000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>In 2018, Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  I will cite part of two articles of the convention.<\/p><p>The first, Article 7, states: <\/p> <blockquote> \tParties shall take all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children.  In all actions concerning children with disabilities, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. <\/blockquote>  <p>Article 24, which relates specifically to education, states that the parties &quot;recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education&quot; and &quot;shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels&quot;.  The article, which continues in great detail, also states the parties will ensure that persons with disabilities &quot;can access an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live&quot; and will &quot;receive the support required, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education&quot;.<\/p><p>This is not happening currently.  Children with additional learning needs are not treated equally to other children.  We have hundreds of children either without a school placement or in an inappropriate school placement.  Children are not being educated in the communities in which they live.  Many are travelling up to 40 km from their homes to access a supposedly suitable school placement.  We have children in our schools on reduced timetables because they have been placed in an unsuitable school setting or insufficient resources have been provided to make the placement work.  Furthermore, we hear of children suspended or expelled for the same reason.  Students in special settings account for only 4% of primary school places but account for 6% of primary school expulsions.  It is inconceivable that any child would be expelled from primary school.  The reason some of these children are being expelled, however, is that the State has let them down and has failed to provide an appropriate school place.  This is totally unfair.<\/p><p>The Minister is letting these children down and denying them their basic rights.  Children are being home-schooled, not because it is their choice but because they had no other option.  Over 1,400 families were supported by the home tuition grant scheme in the 2020-21 school year.  How many of these families had no choice but to apply for this grant?<\/p><p>This Government made a commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that every child with additional educational needs would have an appropriate school place, yet here we are again facing into a new school year with countless children without an appropriate school placement.  The Department of Education and the NCSE have data on precisely how many school places are required for children with additional needs.<\/p><p>There was no excuse for children progressing from primary to secondary school as the number in special classes in schools is known, yet there are insufficient suitable places for children to attend secondary schools in their locality.<\/p><p>The proposal to establish special education centres has shown how out of touch the Government is with what is appropriate and what should be deemed to be inclusive.  It smacks of locking children away in residential centres out of sight and out of mind.  We need emergency action to deal with the crisis looming in two months.  The cumbersome method of enforcing a section 37A process has to be streamlined in some way so that it can be processed much faster.<\/p><p>From September onwards, planning for September 2023 must start in earnest, after which a proper long-term plan for a fully inclusive education must be put in place immediately for the years thereafter.<\/p><p>The parents who have contacted me are very upset that their children are not receiving the education they require.  Children are self-harming.  I am hearing of children banging their heads off the wall or the ground.  Some are suicidal and are lashing out at parents and siblings.  This is born out of frustration that their needs are not being met and is not fair for the child.  Every child deserves a chance to reach its potential and to be happy and safe in its everyday life.  If a child needs are not being met, the child and his or her family are affected.  <\/p><p>I am aware of schools being opened to address a deficit in certain areas but, due to a lack of planning, the school is not working for the children.  This is down to a lack of properly trained staff who do not know how to deal with autistic children or do not know the purpose of a sensory room, for example.<\/p><p>Additional school places need to be provided in every locality to cater for the needs of the children from that locality.  Children should be in a position to attend their local school with their siblings.  There needs to be a move away from segregation to inclusion, with proper planning and resourcing.<\/p><p>I ask that the NCSE and the Department of Education commit to gathering and publishing data quarterly on inappropriate school placements and children attending school outside their locality.  We also need to know how many children are on reduced timetables, how many have been suspended or expelled and how many are dependent on the home tuition grant funding because the school placement was inappropriate or lacked the proper resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400035#KK00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1655229000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I have met hundreds of parents of children with disabilities in recent months, primarily in the area of healthcare and accessing speech and language therapy support, occupational therapy, child psychology and physiotherapy - a whole range of supports that children with disabilities need and cannot get because we do not have adequate resourcing of children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  Part of that involves the lack of supports in schools.  There is obviously a clear link between the assessments of need the HSE should be providing but was not providing - it was found by the High Court to be in breach of the law in respect of those services - and children's educational needs.  An assessment of need was, in theory, to look at the health but also at the educational needs of a child.<\/p> <p>Children with special needs are being failed.  Some weeks ago, the National Principals Forum published a survey which outlined in very stark terms the nature of that failure.  Children with additional needs are on average receiving 21% fewer hours of specialised learning support than 15 years ago.  That is a damning indictment of successive Governments of which the Minister's party was part.  The vast majority of primary schools have more pupils with additional needs than they had four years ago yet the most recent allocation of SNA positions were frozen for the third year in a row.  Eight in ten principals want a full-scale review and a new child-centred system for allocation of special needs resources and places in schools so that every child with additional needs can receive the support that they need in the most appropriate setting.  For the vast majority of children with special needs, that should be in a mainstream school.<\/p> <p> I mentioned the recent High Court finding that the HSE was in breach of the law around assessments of need.  The judge referred to the lack of co-operation between the HSE and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on the allocation of resources.  It blamed the Government for not commencing the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act which successive Governments have promised but which has not happened.  One in four children's disability network posts are vacant.  That is a phenomenal figure.  We are told that 700 posts, mainly therapist posts, cannot be filled amounting to 400,000 hours of therapy that children cannot get because the posts cannot be filled.  We hear excuse after excuse from the Government for why these issues cannot be resolved and how difficult it is to recruit staff but we see no plan in place to increase training places for all these positions so that we can recruit more.  These children have constitutional and legal rights to these services.  According to AsIAm, at least 267 children will not have appropriate places this September.  Each one of those children who will not have a place this year because of Government failure are being badly let down in so many different areas: they are not getting the assessments of need that they deserve, the therapy supports or school places.  Deputy Tully organised a meeting in the audiovisual room some weeks ago which was very well attended.  Five parents of children with special needs, mainly autism, all told stories of their children, what they were like, how much they love them and how brilliant they were but also how challenging it was because of their disabilities.  It was heartbreaking to hear how almost every one of those parents felt let down by the system in access to healthcare supports, therapy supports and also a failure to provide proper school supports and places.  That is unacceptable.  What we are calling for is clear.  First, we want the Minister to publish the real number of children in need of places.  We want her to expedite legislation to ensure adequate provision in schools and we want to ensure that every single child has an appropriate place in September when the schools recommence.  It is the Minister's job to deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400035#KK00300","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655229600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Some weeks ago, a major meeting was held in Dublin 15 in my constituency, about 15 students who have no access to a school placement.  There were two Ministers and a Senator from the Government benches.  Parents after parent spoke of their concerns that their children were again being left behind and they had to fight for everything.  They are weary of fighting for what are their children's rights.  I thank the parents and the activists who took time out the other day to meet myself and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  They told us that out of the 22 places that were identified in the Dublin 15 area only one child has been informed that they have a place in September.  Others have been told that they will get further information in coming weeks but they have told us that they are deeply worried about the admission policies that may leave them at the bottom of the list when it comes to accessing those special classes.  They also do not know what these classes will look like.  I have a lot of experience in this area and I stated very clearly at that meeting that the special class is not just tables, chairs, walls, a teacher or an SNA.  A special class should be much more and the supports should be much more.  There needs to be support and appropriate placement for any particular child.  They need the extra resources in those schools or else we are just talking about a school place and that is it.  Unfortunately in my experience, many of these students will fall out of the system without that support and end up at home and unable to attend school.<\/p>  <p>  Every parent spoke of their frustration dealing with the system.  They simply cannot understand why the NCSE did not properly plan despite numerous warnings that a school placement crisis was looming.  We know what we need.  The Government needs to publish the data on the true number of children with an appropriate school place in September.  The parents told us at the meeting that they know what the information is.  We need to bring forward the emergency legislation to expedite the 37A process.  We need a clear statement that the segregationist proposal of special education centres will not go ahead.  The parents have made it very clear to us that what they are talking about in terms of a hub is a multidisciplinary support hub for children and for parents and not a centre that kids will be just put in and lumped in for their teaching hours and just left there.  They need the supports.<\/p>  <p>  We really need to commit.  This is not something that has just crept up overnight.  It has been there for years and unfortunately it has not been addressed and it does not look like it will be in the near future.

I have raised it here in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions yet the situation does not change.  The parents of children with special needs still have to contact schools far outside their areas while at the same time they are told that there is no need for such classes in the areas where there clearly is a demand.<\/p>  <p>  One area that needs such a class is Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary.  In September I raised with the Taoiseach the fact that no ASD unit or classroom was available for primary school children there.  The Taoiseach told me that there was no issue with resourcing ASD units, that extra classes were being opened and that schools needed to apply for ASD units.  In the middle of February, parents were informed that is not as easy as the Taoiseach made it out to be.  An application made by Gaelscoil Charraig na Si&uacute;ire was unsuccessful.  It was told that current demand appears to be met from the current established classes in surrounding areas.  In an email I received last week, I was told that there are five children travelling from Carrick-on-Suir to a new ASD class that is opening in Portlaw, County Waterford.  Six children will attend this class and three other children with special education needs will start in mainstream in Portlaw.  Some are starting in the Presentation Primary School in Carrick-on-Suir with access to shared SNAs.  Carrick-on-Suir has needed a dedicated ASD class for years yet it is not getting it.  I have been told that more than six children will be looking for an ASD class in September 2023.  If the Government does not want to hear from or chooses not to believe the parents of Carrick-on-Suir, maybe they will listen to AsIAm whose survey of parents over the last two weeks revealed that at least 267 children do not have an appropriate place for this September.  Under section 37A the Minister can compel schools to open special classes.  It is shocking to see the Minister is only now issuing these notices to schools.  We call for the process to be streamlined to ensure additional special classes are opened in time for September.  There is a programme for Government commitment to ensure that every child with a special education need has an appropriate school place.  Carrick-on-Suir and other places in need must be on the Minister's list, and not the shocking idea of segregated classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400036#LL00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1655230200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I move amendment No.1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

Deputy Josepha Madigan, Minister of State at the Department of Education recently announced that the section 37A process to compel schools to increase SEN provision has been initiated for a third time, and that this process is now underway, this process is currently being reviewed as part of the review of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and this review will take into account actual cases where section 37A has been used and the effectiveness for the child;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

and <\/blockquote>furthermore notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; significant investment has been made in the area of Special Education and that this is a key priority for both the Government and the Department of Education; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; while significant progress has been made in adding capacity in schools and special schools to support Special Educational Needs, provision challenges still remain and that the Department of Education will continue to engage intensively with the NCSE, parents and all educational partners to continue to increase capacity.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to the motion.  The Department of Education is committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is supported in reaching their full potential.  We must have an education system that celebrates each child and young person within its care and strives to meets his or her individual needs.  This is at the heart of what we do across the education sector and it is especially at the heart of special education provision, which is a priority area for investment for this Government.<\/p><p>I commend the excellent work happening in many schools around the country in this regard.  As part of my work as Minister for Education, I am deeply fortunate to visit very many schools throughout the country and to meet with their students, staff, parents and broader community members.  I am continually awed by the warmth, integrity and excellence in teaching and learning which I see in classrooms and schools throughout the country, including in respect of special education in both mainstream and specialised settings.  This year, the Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, or more than 25% of the Department's budget, on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs.  This is right and proper and we will continue to increase investment to support students and young people over the term of this Government.<\/p><p>Departmental policy and educational expertise supports children with additional education needs being integrated in mainstream education to the greatest extent possible, with additional resources and supports such as differentiated learning, student support plans, special education teachers and SNAs being made available to schools and students.  The total number of special education teachers in the mainstream school system is 14,385 in 2022 - an overall increase of 980 teaching posts.  Provision has been made for 19,169 SNAs by the end of 2022, which represents an overall increase of 1,165 posts.  It is important to note that students do not require a formal diagnosis or assessment to access these supports.  This ensures that schools and students are able to access supports in a streamlined manner.<\/p><p>This being said, the Department recognises that some children and young people require more specialist support and it is committed to making special school and special class places available for these children.  Ensuring that appropriate class placements are available for students remains one of the key priorities for the Department.  One of the most difficult situations that can arise for any child or parent is for an appropriate school place to not be available for the child.  I will use this opportunity to outline some of the progress that has been made as well as work that we are continuing to do in this regard because I recognise that work must continue apace to ensure that there is joined-up thinking and co-ordination in this regard.<\/p><p>The NCSE is statutorily responsible for planning and co-ordinating provision at both a local and a national level and advising the Department in that regard.  A network of SENOs, who are located throughout the country, will continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.  There is ongoing intensive engagement between the Department, the NCSE and other key stakeholders on short-term requirements for special class and special school places and the more strategic and longer-term requirements on a national and local basis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will update the House in respect of the section 37A process.  I would also like the House to note that engagement is ongoing between the Department and the Office of the Attorney General in respect of the legislative tools available to further expedite this process.<\/p><p>A number of initiatives have been put in place by my Department over the past two years to assist with the planning and co-ordination of special educational needs provision.  These new initiatives are bearing fruit with 315 new special classes due to open for the 2022-23 school year, which will create more than 1,800 places for students.  Two new special schools were established in Dublin in 2021.  A new special school has been established in Cork in this school year and a new special school is being established in the 2022-23 school year in Cork.  Following on from strategic engagement with the Spiritan Education Trust, a new special school will be established in the 2022-23 school year at the Templeogue College campus in Dublin, with the overall objective being to develop a modern, permanent provision for this school to enable it to cater for up to 150 pupils when completed.  This will add very significant capacity for south Dublin area.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Department is committed to planning for the future and all major building projects, such as new school buildings and significant extensions, must include space for special class provision as standard.  Between 2018 and 2021, permanent accommodation for 292 special classes and additional capacity for 122 classrooms in 22 special schools was delivered.  A further 700 projects are currently progressing under the Department's capital plan, which will deliver more than 1,300 new SEN classrooms and 200 replacement SEN classrooms to cater for approximately 7,800 SEN pupils in primary and post-primary education.  Almost 100 of these projects are currently on-site, which will ultimately deliver classroom spaces for almost 1,000 additional SEN pupils.  This investment is reflective of the broader and greater ambition that we hold for the sector.  We will absolutely continue to prioritise investment in this vital and significant area.  As such, I propose the Government's countermotion for consideration this evening.<\/p><p>I again acknowledge the exemplary work of many schools in the area of special education provision throughout the country.  This notwithstanding, I also know from listening to and hearing from young people and families that more work must continue to be done to ensure that every child, including those with additional educational needs, receives timely access to every support he or she might need to reach his or her fullest potential.  We must never lose sight of this goal and I look forward to continuing to work with everyone around the table, including all key stakeholders and interested parties, to ensure this the case.  In this regard, I thank the Deputies for raising these important matters and I look forward to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400037#MM00100","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1655230200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I have just listened very closely to what the Minister has said and I have heard her outline investment and funding that is going in to special education.

I have been here for the past seven years and am black and blue from calling for this every year.  Once June comes, children and families are pitted against each other and fight teachers in Aldi and Lidl because their children cannot get a place in school.  Children with special educational needs are at a significant disadvantage.  In her opening statement, the Minister said the Department's policy on educational expertise supports children with additional educational needs being integrated into mainstream education.  It is a lie and a mistruth.  I know of parents who tried to normalise their children's lives by putting them in primary school, in the mainstream system, with the assistance of teachers, but the problem is that they are ignored when it comes to secondary school because the feeder schools take up the slots.  We do not have enough places.<\/p>  <p>  We all have access to constituency databases.  I hope the information from the census will come out shortly.  The most recent one was in 2016.

We cannot get people into schools in their own area and they will not be able to get school transport because it is outside of its remit.

Parents have come to me saying they have chased down 17 schools that have all said \"No\".<\/p> <p>On the list that was given to a woman in Donaghmede by the special educational needs organiser, SENO, there was a school in Drogheda.  Already we have hundreds of parents around the country who feel that they and their children are second-class citizens.<\/p> <p> I want the Minister to cast her mind back to 18 months ago when we were in the Convention Centre Dublin and we had a discussion about the reopening of schools in January 2021.  The Minister did her absolute best to present herself as a champion of children with special educational needs and their parents by pitting parents against school communities.  I challenged her by saying she was suggesting to us we have to pick a side.  The Minister for Education said she did pick a side, that of young people and children with special educational needs and their parents.  That is exactly what the Minister said.  Fast-forward 18 months, we are now in June 2022 and again we have no solutions to the reality of what these families are facing.  When it suits the Ministers, they can be on the side of children and families who are facing issues of school placement.  When it does not suit them, they have to go through Twitter threads because they know there is a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme coming or they are embarrassed by a child from Tipperary who has to fundraise for her brothers.  They came up with a proposal that is so obnoxious and odious to the rights-based approach of children with special educational needs that it should have been followed by a resignation letter from the Minister with responsibility for special education.  There are temperate, mild-mannered lobby groups and NGOs working in this system and area all the time that are horrified by the warehousing that is effectively a direct provision approach to special educational needs.  It is as if the Ministers are stunned we are in the month of June because they could not predict it.  Allied to this is the fact those who work most intensively in this area, our special needs assistants, SNAs, have the ignominy of being told on the very last day of May whether they have jobs for September.<\/p> <p> I am exhausted listening to parents who are telling me their life stories, and I do not have to deal with it day to day.  I cannot imagine the exhaustion of somebody who is dealing with challenging parenting and who then has to deal with agencies of the State that effectively make them and their child feel worthless.  I and other Deputies deal with campaigning groups from all over the country.  They have to become campaigning groups.  If they were to deal with the State on a one-to-one basis, they would not get anywhere.  Unless they become a campaigning group or a full-time campaigner, they are wasting their time.  Unless they expose the privacy of their family life to television cameras and go on \"Prime Time Investigates\", nothing is going to change.  They must have the campaigning zeal of a child in Tipperary who sees that what is happening to her brothers is not fair or just and has to embarrass the Government into meeting her.  That is the only thing that seems to make a difference.  It does not come from an inherent sense of equality or justice within Government.  It does not come from an inherent sense of equality or justice on the part of the Ministers.  What it comes from is a fire-fighting response to an emergency need.<\/p> <p> I cannot imagine the rage I would feel if I approached the local school in my community with my child whom I have struggled to convince that he or she is an equal citizen in this Republic, and for the local school to say \"No\".  The Ministers cannot at this late stage tell us they have grand plans for section 37A.  It has been utilised twice.  One of those cases is still stuck in the courts.  As has been said, it takes a long time to expedite.  The Ministers could have been reforming section 37A for the past 18 months since they made their grand gesture in the convention centre about how strongly they feel about special needs education, special needs students and their families.  They did not.  When they had a chance to use it as a wedge against teachers and SNAs on the reopening of schools, it was convenient for them.  What actually needed to take place to provide school places for those who need them just did not happen.  As has been said by the proposers of the motion, the Minister needs to take action on section 37A and we will support that.  We supported emergency legislation earlier today.  We will support any amount of time the Minister wants to put forward on section 37A to demand of a school to open up for a child who needs a place and then to resource that school.  I am quite sure there are school principals and communities who are not sure they would get the support of the State if they did go down that road.<\/p> <p> Immediately tonight, the Ministers must end this warehousing proposal.  They must make a statement that it was a bad idea, ill-conceived and poorly thought out.  It has caused a lot of hurt and upset and it is not going anywhere.  The Ministers should make that statement tonight.  They must absolutely commit to the ethic of a local school place for a child in that community.  They must commit to doing anything they possibly can to ensure that right.  They should commit that we will not be back here in six or 12 months' time having the very same debate because it does not suit the Ministers, who are utilising this issue as a wedge to drive between parents, school communities and children with special educational needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400038#NN00500","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655231400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for proposing this motion, which the Social Democrats entirely support along with any and all actions to ensure all children's educational and human rights are met.  I acknowledge the work my colleague, Deputy Gannon, has put into this issue.  Unfortunately, he was unable to be here today for the debate.  There is undeniably a crisis regarding appropriate school places for children with disabilities across our island, although I would be hesitant to use the word \"emergency\".  I am hesitant because this situation has not arisen suddenly, nor has the Department been caught off guard or been unexpectedly faced with this situation.  This crisis has not emerged without warning as emergencies do.  It was entirely foreseeable and preventable.  It is now being made worse by the Department's inability to act with urgency to adopt a rights-based approach when it comes to children with disabilities in our country.<\/p>  <p>  The Education Act 1998 expressly states that the duty of the Minister for Education is to make appropriate education available to everyone in the State, including persons with disabilities.  The right to education is enshrined in our Constitution and the programme for Government has a commitment to ensure each child with a special educational need has an appropriate school place in line with his or her constitutional right.  Yet we know the reality, that there are many families throughout the country who cannot access education for their children with disabilities and these children's rights are being trampled on by this Government.  As public representatives, we receive emails weekly if not more frequently.  We see the stories on the news of families and children having to document the failure of the State to provide an education.<\/p>  <p>  It is galling to hear Departments and Ministers say people with disabilities in Ireland have an equal right to access to education and that the Department's policy is to ensure appropriate education for all children with additional educational needs.  While these rights exist in words and policies, in theory and in the Ministers' ideal, they do not exist in reality for these children or for their families.  They do not exist in the day-to-day lives of the hundreds of children and families throughout the country who cannot get a school place, or for parents who have received more than 20 rejection letters from schools or those who have been forced to accept a school place they know is not suitable or appropriate for their child because there is no other option.<\/p> <p>AsIAm, through its Appropriate School Place survey, found at least 267 children do not have an appropriate school place for this September.  The number is likely to be significantly higher.  The Minister, the Department and the NCSE have access to the data on the true number of children who require an appropriate special education place in September.<br\/><br\/>The survey of AsIAm yielded many other stark findings that show the failure of our education system to provide for all children and the utter desperation families are enduring.  Two hundred and twenty-one of the respondents received no assistance from the NCSE in looking for a school place, and 126 respondents have had no communication from their special educational needs organisers.  Of the respondents whose children have a school place, fewer than 50% received adequate supports, such as special needs assistants and additional teaching time, for those children, and 57% were on reduced timetables.  One hundred and nine respondents accepted school places for September 2022 that are not appropriate for their child&rsquo;s needs.  Of these, 94% received no further support from the NCSE in finding a more suitable place.  Two hundred and forty-one respondents stated they did not expect to receive an offer of an appropriate school place before September 2022.  That paints a picture of a failed system.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that AsIAm conducted this work following the indefensible and legally questionable plans surrounding the special education centres.  The Department has moved away from these, which I welcome and as do many of my colleagues who are present.  However, we need to ask serious questions as to why interim measures based on segregation were developed when the rights and policy are underlined by inclusion.  The idea is completely at odds with international human rights and our national legislation.  Regardless of how briefly it existed, we need to question how it came about.<br\/><br\/>We have a shameful past when it comes to vindicating the rights of people with disabilities.  In 2018, Ireland was the last country to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, committing to do what is needed to ensure people with disabilities can exercise their human rights fully and as equals of non-disabled people.<br\/><br\/>Nearly 20 years on, the Education for People with Special Educational Needs Act has not been fully implemented.  Instead, it was permitted to expire.  I am aware of the ongoing review, which is needed, but we also desperately need a sense of urgency and the will to follow through.  The results must not be more legislation permitted to gather dust on a shelf.  That we do not operate in Ireland with a human-rights-based approach to disability is internationally embarrassing and morally repugnant.<br\/><br\/>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, at its meeting in January 2016, highlighted and criticised our nation for having no comprehensive strategy for the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream education and the encouragement of their autonomy.  The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in its general comment on inclusive education of 2016, stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tPlacing students with disabilities within mainstream classes without accompanying structural changes &hellip; does not constitute inclusion.  Furthermore, integration does not automatically guarantee the transition from segregation to inclusion. <\/blockquote> <p>It also stated:<\/p><blockquote>\t...educational institutions and programmes must be available in sufficient quantity and quality.  States parties must guarantee a broad availability of educational places for learners with disabilities at all levels throughout the community. <\/blockquote> <p>I do not doubt the intention of the Minister or Department but there is a legacy of not meeting the needs of people with disabilities and of their rights not being met.  That is why 241 of the respondents to the AsIAm survey do not expect to receive an offer of an appropriate school place before September 2022.<br\/><br\/>Families are not asking the Department to look into a crystal ball.  They are asking that they and their children not be punished because those children have additional educational needs.  We now have a crisis that must be dealt with urgently while maintaining those children&rsquo;s rights, but we must also have a departmental commitment to planning ahead by providing multi-annual budgeting so schools will be able to provide appropriate places for children with additional educational needs ahead of schedule.<br\/><br\/>There is a disconnect between the reality of children and families across our nation and what the Department and NCSE are presenting as a reality.  How many children are on a waiting list for a special school place?  How many are in need of supports?  The Minister must publish this information.  There must be transparency regarding these failings.  The information is critical and needed so we will no longer have the disconnect.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion, for which I reiterate the support of the Social Democrats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400039#OO00200","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655232000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on its motion.  It is very good.  We are probably debating something we should not be debating because there should not be a need for a debate on special education for children, yet we continue to debate it not only in this Chamber but also outside it.  The issue may seem abstract when debating it but it is not so abstract when it comes to parents and their children not being provided for in September.  It is completely unacceptable that this continues in 2022.  History will judge successive Governments to have let down children by not providing the basic right to an education.  Two hundred and forty-one children will not have an appropriate place come September.  At least 112 children between the ages of one and six are waiting for an appropriate school place.  The stress this brings on is incalculable.  That the children will not have a place is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  As other Deputies have said, many parents come to our constituency offices and tell us their children will have no school places in September.  My head drops when that happens.  As I have said before, Deputies are the last people to whom parents seeking special educational provision speak.  That means the system has failed, and that is just not good enough in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, the matter of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, places, particularly at secondary school.  At present, the ratio between places at primary and secondary levels is 3:1.  Therefore, there is a serious shortage of ASD places in secondary schools.  In the Leinster area, including Dublin, the ratio is 3:1.  Therefore, for every three places at primary level, there is one at second level.  This will lead to a major shortage of appropriate places in secondary schools.  This is already happening.  Some secondary schools are stepping up to the plate and some have reservations about resources, places and so forth.  It is important the resources be put in place.  I can speak only for the area I represent.  I realise there is a major shortage in secondary schools every September.  That has to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The special education centres are a complete non-runner.  The Minister should state they will be completely ruled out.  Parents I have been speaking to, although not all, have said they are not a good idea as they almost institutionalise the special education of their children.  The section 37A legal process compels schools to make provision for special education.  Again, it entails a very arduous, bureaucratic system.  Ultimately, schools probably will not be compelled to provide special educational places.  We should not have circumstances in which schools must be compelled.  If schools were given the resources and adequate provision were made, every one of them would provide special education in the classroom.  There is no doubt about that, but there is a barrier between the resources schools want and what the Department of Education can provide.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to be overly political about this.  Sometimes you have to leave your politics behind but this needs to be sorted out.<\/p> <p>It should have been sorted out yesterday.  I know that, on a personal basis, the Minister of State is embarrassed by this.  It is embarrassing that hundreds of children do not have an appropriate place for September, which is not acceptable.  Let us leave all the politics behind and we will support the Minister of State, as Opposition Deputies, to finally resolve this issue.  This has been decades in the making and successive Governments simply have not worked it out.  This is a very wealthy country and there are a lot of resources.  For children to be denied an education when they are between five and eight years old is unacceptable.  I hope that in the two and a half years left of this Government, if it lasts that long, it can at least address some of the issues that are letting down children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400040#PP00200","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655232600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this very important issue.  As the previous speaker said, we should not be here talking about it because we should have had solutions in place many years ago so the resources would be there.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the role of the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in the past two and a half years.  I acknowledge the amount of investment that has been announced and the amount of work that is being done to try to improve services.  In my own town of Tuam, we opened a new special needs school, St. Oliver's, which is a fine, state-of-the-art building and is great for the children who have use of it.  I know the Minister of State has great plans for investment.  However, having been in a ministerial role in government, I understand that the process by which things get done and physically get built on the ground is gruesome and arduous, and it saps a lot of the money from what that money is supposed to be for.  It goes on consultants, reports and all of that kind of thing before we actually see construction on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  The other part is that if we are going to set out a plan for what is going to happen over the next four to five years with special needs education, the first thing we need to do is to get the data right as to what we are dealing with, including the numbers, where people are located and how the issues are being addressed, and we need a programme that lists how works will commence and how they will be finished.  Parents find that the cruellest part of their whole existence is the fact they do not know when and they cannot find out when.  With this lack of implementation of the plans, it is the children who suffer most, as well as their families, who are under severe pressure.  They then find themselves under even more pressure because the whole process is very slow and very cumbersome and many years pass by before they actually see the infrastructure in place.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the issue of resources to teach children and to offer every child the opportunity to progress in life, to gain employment and to realise their full potential.  In my constituency, there is a group called PALS, which is a group of parents of autistic people in Loughrea and surrounding areas, which represents more than 150 families.  Loughrea does not have any ASD room in any of the national schools in the town.  Next year or the year after, St. Raphael&rsquo;s secondary school will have an ASD room but, in the meantime, the families of children have to seek out education in the surrounding towns and villages and in schools in rural areas.  That is causing serious problems where brothers and sisters are going to a mainstream school and another child has to go to a different school, which is creating segregation in its own right.  When we think about it, the schools that are there have a limited supply as well.<\/p>  <p>  The teacher training programmes need to be updated to ensure a ready supply of special needs teachers who also have the opportunity to advance in their careers.  This is to ensure special needs education becomes a very important and integrated part of our total education system.<\/p>  <p>  The summer school programme this year is causing problems, with people trying to get places.  It is important that this is addressed and corrected as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  The Department needs to provide guidance and recommendations on apps for children who cannot follow the standard curriculum or the adapted curriculum.  That choice and recommendation is being left to parents.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, I find that a recurring theme from parents is that services are not available and they are under-resourced, and parents are left fighting a daily battle for their children.  AsIAm and Autism Ireland are doing so much work in this fight for people with autism and we need to listen to them before it is too late.  Joined-up thinking is required from the assessment and through the education process, from primary school to secondary school and on to third level education, in a manner that all parents can follow and understand from day one.<\/p>  <p>  A child's right to education is enshrined in our Constitution.  Under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it must be accessible on an equal basis with others in the community in which they live.  It is incumbent on us, as elected representatives, to make sure that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400041#QQ00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1655232600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>At present, just three primary schools and one secondary school are providing autism-specific classes in the wider Athlone area.  This is grossly inefficient to meet the current needs and no new classes are planned for September, which is completely unacceptable.  It needs to be urgently addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Four weeks ago, I raised in the House with the Minister of State the lack of secondary school places for children with autism in Athlone and south Roscommon, which will force students to travel up to 100 km each day to avail of a second level education from September.  I know of two children in south Roscommon who will travel up to 100 km a day as they will have to make the daily journey to Glenamaddy, County Galway to access a second level education in an autism-specific class.  In fact, there will be 11 children leaving primary school in the catchment of Athlone and south Roscommon in the next fortnight who have no local autism-specific school place.  These 11 children will travel up to 150,000 km over the next school year because of the failure to provide autism classes in local schools.  So much for climate change and so much for helping families with the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  Four weeks ago, the Minister of State told me she was meeting with the NCSE the following day and that she was going to bring up the crisis situation in Athlone and south Roscommon.  She told me that the NCSE had told her that it was confident it would meet the demands for special class places and special school places for this September in both Roscommon and Athlone, and that there was sufficient capacity for those children from September this year.  Not one of the parents has been contacted or has heard anything from either the Department, the NCSE or the SENO in the past four weeks.  Even those who have been forced to travel up to 100 km a day are not being given any information about transport, how it is envisaged that they are going to get to school each day or how they are going to be able to afford to pay for the petrol to travel these astronomical distances.  These children should be entitled to an education in their own town along with their schoolmates and their brothers and sisters.  I do not think it is too much to ask.  I urge the Minister of State to intervene in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, four weeks ago, she advised me that where schools were collaborating and there was a willingness to open the special classes, they should be given the space to do that.  Despite that approach being taken, the Department and the NCSE are not supporting schools that are willing to alter special classes.  St. Com&aacute;n&rsquo;s Wood Primary School in Roscommon town has been refused a special class for children with multiple and complex disabilities.  This is despite having the numbers for such a class and despite the fact the application was supported by both the senior psychologist in the child disability network team and the local SENO.  St. Com&aacute;n&rsquo;s Wood has an excellent reputation for giving children opportunities to taste success, irrespective of their circumstances.  This has resulted in some children with special needs moving from neighbouring schools to St. Com&aacute;n&rsquo;s Wood.  Many parents without any special needs also choose to send their children to the school because they want an inclusive education for their children that reflects the wider community.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that resource hours and SNAs do not meet the needs of children with multiple disabilities.<\/p> <p>Having part-time access to an SNA or resource hours does not work for them.  They need constant support throughout the day where they are engaged with in activities that are relevant and meaningful to them.<\/p> <p> I note there are 25 special classes in mainstream schools for children with multiple disabilities throughout the country.  There are two in Clare, five in Cork, two in Donegal, four in Galway, eight in Kerry, one in Louth and three in Mayo.  Not one has been sanctioned for County Roscommon.  Despite the fact that the board of management has identified a need, supported the school in making the application and received the endorsement of both the HSE and the SENO, the Department of Education is not willing to support the establishment of this special class.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400041#QQ00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655233200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue.  I also welcome that I have finally received confirmation from the National Council for Special Education that a special education needs organiser has been put in place in County Laois.  However, we are still waiting for a SENO to be put in place in County Offaly.  This is a great source of frustration to the parents I meet daily and also to the schools that have contacted me about this matter.  It is unacceptable to be missing such a critical person for helping parents.  I understand the SENO is to be put in place by the end of July.  I ask both Ministers to ensure that happens.<\/p>  <p>  Parents are exhausted from trying to fight for their children with special needs.  I meet these parents continually.  It is very unfair.  They face barrier after barrier.  They need help.  A SENO should be in place in County Offaly.  There is no excuse for the delays that have been experienced already.  It has been a long drawn-out process and this needs to happen by the end of July, as promised.  While this is vitally important in terms of co-ordinating and protecting the rights of special needs children, it must also be matched with increased capacity in schools and a ramping up of the number of special needs assistants.  Without that we will have a situation akin to being referred by a GP for a service that simply cannot be provided.  There are serious gaps in terms of meeting the needs of children with special needs.  I acknowledge the great support groups such as Laois Offaly Families For Autism, LOFFA, which supports children with autism in Laois and Offaly and their parents.  If it were not for such groups, many parents would be totally at a loss and I commend them on their work.<\/p>  <p>  I highlight the point in the motion regarding the 13-step process of compelling schools to open special units under section 37A of the Education Act 1998.  I agree that far from being an emergency response, the process is incredibly cumbersome and time-consuming.  It is also a useful political trick of being seen to do something but in reality doing nothing to improve the situation in a simple and practical way.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the issue of the special education needs organiser and special education in February with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, through a parliamentary question.  I found it appalling to be told in an extraordinary reply at the time that it was nothing to do with the Minister of State and that I should contact the NCSE.  This is what parents face every day of the week.  When we as Deputies try to help them we should receive more support and assistance.  I want to call that out.  It is typical of the approach of this Government to seek the praise, while accepting none of the responsibility or assisting in times of need.  We have to remember that children with special educational needs have already been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 restrictions and the loss of school time.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, on which I sit, was told by the National Principals Forum, NPF, that more than half - 53.6% - of principals surveyed had observed an increase in special educational needs children returning to school.  The NPF further noted that this increase could be caused by the loss of engagement, skills, learning and human connection of students with special educational needs.  All of the challenges are unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to take action on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400042#RR00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1655233200,"counter":358,"content":"<p>The Private Members&rsquo; motion relates to national schools providing appropriate places for children in our educational system and I agree with it.

When parents of children with special needs look for places in the educational system schools will not give places to children without a diagnosis from a health professional.  The educators say they need to provide appropriate care relative to the disability of the child.  Waiting times for assessments are extraordinary, with huge delays.  The health service states there is no requirement for a formal assessment in order to get a school place, yet children are being refused school places because they have no official diagnosis.  Therein lies the difficulty.  On one hand, the education sector states that a child needs a diagnosis while, on the other, the health sector states that a diagnosis is not needed.  Will the Minister please talk to the Department of Health to see whether we can find a resolution to move forward.  The failure of the two Departments to talk to each other is causing delays for children seeking to secure a place in school.  It is not rocket science for people to talk to each other, or for two Departments to talk to each other, to find a way forward to meet the genuine care needs of children.

I expect Deputy Foley, as a Minister from Kerry, surely to see after Ballyduff and Tarbert national schools to ensure that they do not lose a teacher.  Every parish has a hollow, maybe, where they go down a few children.<\/p> <p> Of course, I must ask the Minister about the Black Valley school, which is the only school in the Black Valley.  It is a proud community.  Like that, they are suffering.  Numbers are declining a bit.  I believe that if they could get over this hump and if the school could remain open this year - I appeal to the Minister to do her level best to ensure the Black Valley school is not closed on her watch as Minister for Education - when we go on there will be plenty of children but if it is closed, it will never again open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400042#RR00400","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655233800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>  <p>  It is concerning to think that there are many parents in this country who have been unable to find a place at an appropriate school for their child this coming September.  I cannot imagine the stress these parents are under, being forced into a situation such as this so late in the year and with September only around the corner.<\/p>  <p>  AsIAm&rsquo;s latest snap survey is particularly troubling, bearing in mind that the survey is merely a snapshot of a nationwide crisis with less than half of respondents based in Dublin.  It is clear that there is a massive shortage in appropriate school places for children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.<\/p>  <p>  The snap survey has shown that at least 267 children do not have an appropriate school place for September 2022.  Shockingly, 241 respondents do not expect to receive an offer of an appropriate school place at all before September, meaning that many children will have no school to go to next year.  Imagine how that would feel, to a student and to a parent, for a young person to miss out on all that school has to offer, not only as regards education, but also as regards the social and development opportunities it gives our young people.<\/p>  <p>  What is worse is that we know that this number is nowhere near accurate and it is expected that there are numerous more stuck in the same situation.  We also know that the Government most likely knows, or at least has the means to find out, what that exact number is.  Despite this, these numbers have yet to be released and, cynically, I have to say that I believe the reason they have not been is because of how high they are and how bad this looks.  There is no other explanation.  That is truly despicable.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has stated in its amendment to this motion that \"a child's right to education is enshrined in the Constitution and, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, must be accessible on an equal basis with others in the community in which they live\".  This just proves how meaningless their own statements are.  How can one say that a child's right to education must be accessible while so many in this country do not have access to appropriate education?  The Government cannot be allowed to come in here and state that it believes that every child deserves equal access to education when its actions quite literally say the opposite.  Something needs to change.  We need to ensure that there are adequate resources for all children to get the education they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  No child can be left behind.  We need to look seriously into resourcing and funding to ensure this.  The Government, at the very least, needs to publish the correct figures so that we can see properly the scale of this issue and what the problem is.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious problem in my constituency of Donegal and in many rural constituencies, where there is a complete lack of services in some parts.  I have talked with many parents who have a child with additional needs and who seriously struggle to live in rural areas.  They are forced to travel long distances for services and for appropriate schools, and for many this is not doable.  Many of them have submitted multiple applications to schools in the hope that somewhere can offer appropriate special education.  This should not be the way that parents have to behave.<\/p>  <p>  Every child deserves and is entitled to an appropriate school place in his or her locality which meets his or her needs in agreement with his or her parents and psychologists&rsquo; report yet we are hearing reports of families that are unable even to get a psychologist's report to recommend this.  This is not acceptable and cannot be tolerated any longer.<\/p>  <p>  It is completely unfair that the stress and panic of this has been placed solely on the shoulders of the parents who have received such minimal assistance from the State regarding it.  I am thinking especially of those parents who do not have English as their first language and who receive such little help in situations such as this.  School placement and enrolment should be only a positive experience and should not be seen as negative.  However, many parents living in direct provision and in temporary accommodation are completely left behind as well.<\/p>  <p>  AsIAm states that it believes that this crisis was \"foreseeable and preventable\", which suggests an inexcusable failure by the Department.  It is clear that there has been a complete lack of preplanning here and I have to ask why.  Surely the numbers are there.  Surely something could have been done sooner than June.<\/p>  <p>  Going forward, AsIAm states that \"through better planning, communication and a rights-based approach, we believe an emergency response is needed in an emergency situation.\"  Unfortunately, this is now undeniably an emergency situation.  We must respond accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  I support this motion.  I believe the amendments put forward by the Government are inappropriate and make no attempt to address this emergency situation properly.<\/p>  <p>  I support Sinn F&eacute;in's call for the Government to publish data on the number of students who do not have an appropriate school place as soon as possible and I will be following up with the Minister's office on this.  We cannot address the problem without first realising the scale of it.  This is the very least that we can do.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has to know these figures.  If the Department does not know the figures, even bigger questions have to be asked.  We should be able to gather these figures.  We should know the extent of the problem.  If we cannot meet it all the time that is fair enough but we should at least know what we are addressing and be upfront about it as well.  It is the least we can expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400043#SS00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1655233800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.<\/p><p>I too share their views that children with special education needs should be supported to access the education system.  As a Government, we fully recognise the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education system.  Never is it more important than in the case of children with special education needs.  I fundamentally believe that our most vulnerable children in society must be prioritised.<\/p><p>Government policy on supporting children with special educational needs aims to ensure that all children with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  Our policy is to provide for inclusive education and to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools.  Where pupils require more targeted interventions, special class or special school placements are also provided.<\/p><p>I re-emphasise the significant levels of financial provision that are made each year to ensure that all children with special educational needs, SEN, can access education.  The Department currently spends in excess of &euro;2 billion, which is over 25% of the Department's budget, on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with SEN.<\/p><p>My Department has significantly increased the availability of specialist placements for children with SEN as well as bringing ever more children into mainstream education.  Continuing to add capacity in schools to support SEN provision is a key priority of the Government and a key priority in the roll-out of the national development plan.<\/p><p>I recently secured an agreement with the Department which ensures that all new school buildings will have compulsory special class provision moving forward.  This future proofing will include the incorporation of four special classes in all new 1,000 student post-primary schools and other large-scale projects, and <i>pro-rata<\/i>provision for medium-to-smaller schools.  Primary school buildings will also include special class provision and that will be accommodation for two special classes.<\/p><p>In the national development plan, there will also be a particular emphasis at post-primary level.  This includes permanent accommodation for 292 special classes and additional capacity for 122 classrooms in 22 special schools delivered during the national development plan, NDP, period, which was 2018 to 2021.  There is a further 700 projects currently progressing under the NDP which will deliver over 1,300 new SEN classrooms and 200 replacement SEN classrooms catering for approximately 7,800 SEN pupils across primary and post-primary.  Almost 100 of these projects are currently on-site, which will ultimately deliver classroom spaces for almost 1,000 additional SEN pupils.  Taken together, this will enable new additional or modernised accommodation at over 50% of the special schools and 60% of post-primary schools will either have an existing special class or have a project on the school building programme which will provide SEN accommodation.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p> In March last, I announced for the first time that special education provision would open with the fee charging patron, the Spiritan Education Trust.  This was a significant policy direction change for the Department and one that I was proud to spearhead.  We listened to school communities.  We listened to what parents were telling us.  I welcomed the memorandum of understanding with the Spiritan Order, which marks for the first time that schools such as these will be part of the provision of special education in Ireland without barriers to entry for those who need a place.  Under this arrangement, a new special school will be established in the 2022-23 school year in the existing accommodation at the Templeogue College campus in Dublin.  The overall objectives are to develop a modern, permanent provision for this school over time and to eventually enable it to cater for up to 150 pupils with special education needs.  This will add significant capacity for the south Dublin area.<\/p> <p> My Department has also informed the NCSE that the policy position has changed since March 2022 and that the Department will support special classes in other fee-charging schools as needed.  This is a much-needed development which will help to meet the demand for special school places in the area.  My Department has been intensely engaging with the NCSE, school patrons and school authorities to ensure there are sufficient adequate special school places and special classes available for the 2022-23 academic year.  The Department, the Minister and I will continue to engage with the NCSE school patrons and school authorities over the summer months to increase capacity where needed.  As the Minister mentioned, so far, 315 new special classes are due to open for the 2022-23 school year, providing 1,800 new school placements.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael in Government has have made significant progress in recent years in increasing the number of special class and special school places, as well as increasing the numbers of special education teachers and special needs assistants to record levels.  However, I know that for many parents listening, numbers and statistics mean nothing if their child does not currently have an appropriate school place.  I want to say to parents that while I could not possibly understand all of the day-to-day pressures they are facing, I am on their side and I am committed to ensuring that as many places as possible are available.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael believes in supporting children with special education needs to achieve their full potential.  I believe this commitment was clear when the T&aacute;naiste appointed me as the first ever Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion.  I am determined to continue that work until no child is left without a placement.  We have already made major inroads but we have a huge amount of work left to do.<\/p> <p> I recently announced that I would be initiating the section 37A process to compel schools to increase the number of places for children with special educational needs.  I was left with no other choice but to take this substantive action.  I believe this is a necessary step to try to ensure that every child gets the supports he or she needs and access to school placement.  All parties would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places, rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from the Minister.  The evidence available in this school year is that schools are willing to work collaboratively with the Department and the NCSE on the provision of new school places for children with special educational needs.  I am grateful to all concerned for their ongoing work in this regard.  <\/p> <p> Where schools do not volunteer to provide more places, the section 37A process is one of the tools available to the Department to ensure that adequate suitable education provision is made for children with special needs.  It is not a substitute for advanced planning.  I fundamentally believe that all schools should have to provide places for children with special educational needs.  It is not good enough for a school to say it does not cater for children with additional needs.  I cannot and will not accept that.<\/p> <p> The NCSE has formally written to me, as Minister of State, to advise me that it has formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin.  The second stage of the process is now complete.  I have informed the NCSE in relation to planned additional provision of education for children with special educational needs and available land and buildings.  The NCSE will now provide a detailed report on the matter to me, which will consider existing provision, any relevant proposed building works and which schools may be able to provide additional provision.  In preparing this report, the legislation requires the NCSE to consult school patrons, national parent bodies, school management bodies and teacher unions.  I have insisted that this be done as quickly as possible, and I expect that will be the case.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, the section 37A process itself is being reviewed as part of the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  The review will take into account actual cases where section 37A has been used and the effectiveness of it for the child.  I believe the process needs to be more streamlined and a more expedited process needs to be put in place.<\/p> <p> The Department is separately considering whether there is a need to introduce new emergency legislation to assist in securing additional special education needs provision.  As the Minister said, the Department recently met the Office of the Attorney General to discuss the matter.  This work will consider whether new legislation would assist in expediting the section 37A process.  The Department of Education, together with the NCSE, will continue to work with schools, patron bodies and teachers so that they can establish special classes, where required, with confidence.  In that way, we will continue to seek to meet the educational needs of children in their local school insofar as possible.  The Department is working closely with stakeholders, including parents and advocacy groups, to ensure that children with special educational needs can access education placements that are appropriate to their needs.  I am very aware that listening to the voices of parents and to those representing children with disabilities is essential to ensuring that what we deliver meets the needs of the children.  There is a shared determination to work intensively on the issues facing us in relation to school placements so that we can find a way forward with the best interests of the children at heart.<\/p> <p> I, too, thank Deputies for raising the issues today.  This has provided me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that children with special education needs are provided with every opportunity to fully participate in and benefit from the education system.  I know this is a very emotive topic for thousands of families across the country.  I realise that every case of a child with special education needs is different.  I have met many parents recently and I want to let them know that we are listening.<\/p> <p> I emphasise that the Government is committed to ensuring that each child with a special educational need has an appropriate school place, in line with their constitutional right and under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Having outlined the significant commitment towards the education of children with special needs, the Government recommends the countermotion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400043#SS00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655234400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and call on Deputy Ward to conclude.

I stood in solidarity as they spoke about children's disability services.  The Minister of State mentioned emotion.  I could not help but be emotional while listening to the parents and children who shared their lived experiences.  They have to fight every single day just to get the basic care, access to treatment and school places their children need.<\/p>  <p>  One of the groups at the protest on Saturday was the Clondalkin Autism Parents Support Network, which is based in my area.  I met members of the group a couple of weeks ago and I will meet them again tomorrow with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The word I can use to best describe those parents is \"exhausted\".  They are absolutely exhausted from just trying to get the basic care their children need.  The group has been invited to the audiovisual room of Leinster House in the next couple of weeks.  I will invite both the Minister and the Minister of State to personally meet its members at that briefing, so that they can hear first-hand what those parents have to go through.<\/p>  <p>  The Clondalkin Autism Parents Support Network asked me to raise the lack of autism spectrum disorder secondary school places in my area in Dublin Mid-West.  Information the group received from the National Council for Special Education indicates that there are 17 primary schools with 29 ASD classes.  That is 174 children in primary school ASD classes.  We currently have five secondary schools with 1.5 ASD classes, which will accommodate 45 children.  Simple mathematics tells me that putting 174 children into 45 places does not go.  There is a promise and commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that every child with a special educational need has an appropriate school place.  The Government is failing these children.<\/p> <p>The recent proposal that children with special educational needs be segregated and isolated from the school community in special education centres is a retrograde and completely unacceptable step.  Desperate parents may feel pressured to accept these places simply because they have no other option.  This goes against the provision in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 that every child must have an appropriate school place.  Children with special educational needs must be part of our schools but not apart from our schools.  The latter will happen if this provision is introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400044#TT00300","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655235000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely and important motion.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on bringing it forward.  I also commend FUSS Ireland on its activism on these issues.  As Deputy Ward said, its members were out across the country, including in Dublin, on Saturday.  I had an opportunity to meet with Rachel Martin of FUSS Ireland in my constituency on Friday.  The activism and energy that are committed by parents of children with disabilities, who have so many caring responsibilities, is to be commended.  The name of the organisation, FUSS Ireland, indicates what these parents are fighting for, that is, services and supports for their children.  It is shameful that they have to expend such energy to keep fighting for what should be basic and fundamental rights.<\/p>  <p>  There is a failure to plan, prepare and resource services at practically every level.  Ministers talk about investment and offer statistics and figures, but the question of unmet need is really where the focus needs to be.

It is an awful shame that parents have to make such efforts on behalf of their children.  There are deep concerns for the coming September and even more concerns for September 2023.

I have engaged with many parents across the State in recent weeks and months, including parents in Dublin 4, 2, 6 and 6W, Kildare and Cork.  I am meeting with groups from Clondalkin and Dublin 8 in the coming days.  I hear the same story from all of them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's amendment refers to money and the investment that has been made.  In the past, including at the time of the budget, I have welcomed investment in special education.  However, this is far from just being a monetary issue.  Of course money and funding are necessary for the provision of staff, accommodation and so on.  The real issue, however, is lack of planning and preparation.  There is almost a stubbornness in this regard from the Department of Education and the NCSE.<\/p>  <p>  All the parents in all the groups tell us the same old story.  They are not just worried about this coming September but also the following September and the one after that.  They do not trust the Department and the NCSE to plan properly.  Parents go to the NCSE in September and are told there are enough places before going back, getting the famous list from the special educational needs organiser, SENO, and being told to ring all the listed schools and they will find a place eventually.  The NCSE tells them again in October that there are enough places.  The Department's attitude, likewise, is that there is enough space in the system and their child will be accommodated.  However, every year for at least the past four or five years, when it comes to April or May, it is panic stations when the NCSE and the Department realise there are, in fact, not close to enough spaces.  There certainly are not enough spaces this year, with 120 children across Dublin and well over 250 across the State, at a minimum, in need of provision.  Those figures do not even include the pupils in home tuition who should be in a special class or those in a mainstream class who should be in a special class.  There are not anywhere near enough places and we get nothing but eleventh-hour responses.<\/p>  <p>  I am more worried now, after this debate, than I was beforehand.  The Minister's amendment brings nothing new to the table.  It merely regurgitates the same old measures we know are not working and expresses the hope that the schools that have been requested politely to open will, in fact, open.  The review of section 37 of the Education Act is being lumped in with the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which is a lengthy process that has already been under way for a year.  There is nothing about ensuring the ongoing problems are prevented in the future.  I had parents coming to me five years ago and throwing down the various letters showing their child had been refused a place, put on a waiting list or been asked to contact the particular school in September two years away.  I had a message today from a parent detailing the list of schools she had contacted.  Again, she had a collection of letters indicating either that her child had been refused a place or was on a waiting list.  It is now June and that child still does not have a place when all the schools are closing for the summer.  That is where we are at and I do not see an adequate sense of urgency in addressing it.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, it comes down to a lack of planning.  We need a solution for September and there must be urgent action in that regard.  Above all, we need there to be no further repetition of this problem.  If that is to happen, there must be a culture shift in terms of planning from the Department and the NCSE.  The proposal around centres of special education shows clearly one aspect of the problem and the dysfunction that exists.  The Minister is coming out with this proposal while the Minister of State walks away from it.  I do not know who is responsible for the absolute fiasco that has occurred but we need a clear statement that it will not happen again.  The Minister, the Minister of State, the NCSE and everyone in the Department must pull in the same direction, with schools, to ensure we get what the Minister has said she is committed to, which is an appropriate school place for every child for this September.  That provision is a constitutional right.  This is not a bald assertion; it is a fact long established in court.  It is these children's constitutional right to have an appropriate school place.  We must ensure we are not failing them come September and, certainly, the following September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400045#UU00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655235000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655235000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Is the amendment in the Minister's name agreed to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400045#UU00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655235000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>No.  V&oacute;t&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400045#UU00600","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1655235000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Orders, the vote is deferred until the weekly division time tomorrow evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400045#UU00700","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1655235000,"counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400045#UU00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1655235000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has completed its consideration of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400045#UU00900","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1655235600,"counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400046#VV00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","time":1655235600,"counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400046#VV00200"},{"type":"question","time":1655235600,"counter":377,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[30744\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400046#VV00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the measures that he will take to address the challenges in the taxi sector, including rising fuel and running costs and driver shortages; if he has assessed the likely impact of a further exit from the sector due to the ten-year rule; the degree to which he has engaged with the National Transport Agency and taxi representatives on these matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1655235600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State what measures she will take to address the challenges in the taxi sector, including rising fuel and running costs and driver shortages.

Will she make a statement on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400046#VV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1655235600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic and more recently, the Government and the NTA have been actively engaged in ensuring appropriate and timely measures are in place to support the taxi sector in addressing the challenges it faces.  I recognise that rising fuel costs are a significant challenge for all sectors.  As the Deputy is aware, on 9 March the Government announced a temporary reduction in fuel-related excise duties of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel.  These reductions, which were due to finish at the end of August, will be extended until budget day in October, at an additional cost of &euro;80 million.  This should help to reduce the operating costs of all private and commercial vehicle owners, including operators of non-electric small public service vehicles, SPSVs.  In addition, the NTA's national maximum fares review, which closed for public consultation on 27 May, proposes an average increase of 12% in taxi fares from 31 August 2022.  This will be the first increase in such fares since 2017.<\/p>  <p>  While the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating the SPSV industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework, including choosing the times at which they operate.  The NTA's 2022 driver survey shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently undertake night work.  Some 30% of drivers, up from 17% in 2019, reported that they would consider doing night work if the relevant fares were to increase.  In recognition of this, the proposed fare increases have been weighted in favour of the premium rate that can be charged for journeys between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., as well as on Sundays and public holidays.  The increase in cents and euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial, but the cumulative impact is significant for drivers.  The weighting in the increase has been designed to encourage more drivers to operate during these periods and also to encourage drivers who may still not have come back into the sector since the pandemic to reactivate their licences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400046#VV00500","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1655235600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>There is a crisis in the sector and I am not convinced from the Minister of State's answer that there is a full appreciation of it.

It was reported just this evening that one of the taxi apps had 17,000 requests in a one-hour period over the weekend.  We are hearing many stories about people, including women, waiting an inordinate time because of the lack of availability of taxis at night-time.  This is going to be compounded by approximately 5,300 cars that are going to be taken off the road at the end of this year because of the ten-year rule.

These extensions of vehicle age limits were emergency measures in recognition of the challenges faced during the pandemic, including the necessary health-related restrictions imposed on society and the resultant collapse in demand for SPSV services.  This situation is now much changed and there has been a resurgence in demand for SPSV services with increased levels of social activity and particularly at night-time.

For this reason, he was pleased to be able to introduce a 20% average fare reduction on public service obligation, PSO, public transport services until the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  This initiative is benefiting the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day.  The Minister is delighted to report that passenger numbers are slowly returning to pre-Covid-19 figures.  Last week, on average, PSO services carried about 84% of the numbers they carried before the pandemic.  In fact, certain markets are reporting passenger levels well above 2019 levels, particularly on some of our Local Link, town and regional city services.  All of these individuals are now benefiting from lower fare costs.<\/p>  <p>  The 20% fare reduction comes on top of several other measures that we are progressing to encourage greater public transport patronage.  For instance, there is the young adult Leap card, which provides an average 50% fare discount for those aged between 19 and 23 on both PSO and commercial services.  There is also the Transport for Ireland, TFI, 90-minute fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin.  In May alone, the number of people who had a child Leap card, a student Leap card, or the new young adult Leap card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  While fare reductions are to be welcomed, the investment in additional services is also critical.  For this reason, the Minister is committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+, as well as improving existing services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, public transport fare initiatives have a role to play in combatting the rising cost of transport and in encouraging modal shift.  As such, the Minister would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023.  He is acutely aware, however, of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources.  The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so the Minister will work closely with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and other Government colleagues, in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400049#YY01200","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1655237400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I greatly welcome the commitment from Government and from the Minister for Transport to look towards extending the reduced public transport fares into 2023.

The statistics that the Minister of State has been supplied with by the providers across the country, and most acutely for me, by Dublin Bus, Luas and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, are very critical.

A 50% reduction in these trips would account for 15% to 17.5% of overall demand.  This supported the anecdotal evidence that many office workers are working a hybrid model of two or three days per week at home.

Two further applications, the Blanchardstown to city centre scheme and the Liffey Valley to city centre scheme, will be made in June, with the remainder to follow during the second half of 2022.  In parallel, a construction strategy is being developed for all corridors which will include the commencement of the procurement of contractors.  The timing of the construction contract award and commencement will be determined by the decision timeline of An Bord Plean&aacute;la with regard to the planning consent applications.<\/p> <p> If the compulsory purchase order, CPO, is confirmed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and subject to any legal challenges by way of judicial review, a document called a notice to treat will be served on each landowner whose land is being acquired.  Following service of the notice to treat, the landowner will be required to submit a claim for compensation, at which stage the NTA will engage with all landowners with regard to their specific requirements.  The NTA is available to discuss the CPO process with any resident who may have specific queries or concerns.<\/p> <p> As with all schemes where roads and streets are being upgraded, there will be some temporary disruption and alterations to on-street and off-street parking provision and access to premises in certain locations along the proposed scheme.  Local arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis to maintain continued access to homes and businesses affected by the works, where practicable.  Details regarding temporary access provisions will be discussed with homes and businesses prior to construction starting in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400050#ZZ01800","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655238600,"counter":445,"content":"<p>The C spine is up and running in Lucan.

However, our existing approach to the taxation of motor vehicles through vehicle registration tax, VRT, is already designed to encourage a shift to improved emissions performance and my Department continues to engage with the Department of Finance on further possible improvements.  I note that budget 2021 introduced a revised charging structure for VRT bands based on the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, WLTP, emissions test to better reflect real driving data, which follows the introduction of a nitrogen oxide surcharge in budget 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of recent studies which reflect the fact that while the standards imposed on vehicle manufacturers have led to an overall reduction in tailpipe emissions in new vehicles, an increasing trend towards the purchase of larger vehicle models can bring significant environmental and air quality risks with the increased shedding of toxic particulate matter through increased tyre wear.  This is a risk which may also apply to heavier electric vehicle models.<\/p>  <p>  Given the increased risk to vulnerable and other road users involved in collisions with heavier vehicles, I believe we need to take a wider holistic approach and shift to more sustainable transport modes and reduce our level of private car use more generally, which will improve overall well-being and make our urban centres more attractive places to live.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s recently published sustainable mobility policy and Five Cities Demand Management Study sets out the vision and actions we will take.

This is new research that we all need to take on board.  The Fit for 55 package of measures includes a proposal to revise the carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars and light goods vehicles as currently set out in EU regulation 2019\/631.

At the time all staff were working a four day week and salaries were reduced to 80% from normal levels, giving rise to significant savings.  However, even with these temporary measures in place and given the dramatic fall in passenger numbers, the DAA advised that it needed to urgently reduce staff numbers to align with the reduced volume of business.

I know he gets this.  We made representations to him and the Department previously regarding meat factory workers, and that issue was resolved.  While I do not want to compare the issue I am raising tonight with the plight of those in the meat industry, it still surrounds the issue of visas and non-EU workers.  I would appreciate the feedback of the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  Initially, I want to flag a couple of the positive things that have been achieved by the Government in the past two years.  We have gone from 19 million hours to 24 million hours in 2020 and again in 2021, funding was provided for 24 million home care hours, which is most welcome.  I understand there are more home help hours being delivered to more patients than ever before in the home, as it should be and as Government policy requires.<\/p>  <p>  That said, yesterday I attended a briefing with my local HSE management.  In the three hours I and my Oireachtas colleagues were there, we spoke about the well-documented recruitment crisis in the HSE, with anywhere between a 15% and 25% vacancy rate across the country in respect of the filling of various vacancies.  While this difficulty in recruiting employees is obvious among consultants, therapists in disability services, psychologists and other professional fields, it is perhaps most acutely felt in the area of home care.  I say this because those other posts I mentioned are in short supply globally and the State&rsquo;s critical list allows those posts to be filled by international candidates, including non-EU applicants.  A non-EU person can also apply for a post in a nursing home care setting and as a healthcare assistant in a hospital setting.  However, non-EU candidates cannot be recruited for home care supports.<\/p>  <p>  This policy is discriminatory and flies in the face of what we, as a State, are trying to promote, which is to keep people at home for as long as possible and to target care and support in the home as much as is practicable.  I genuinely do not understand why the critical skills list is not amended to reflect the fact we have hundreds of thousands of hours allocated and approved in home care but we cannot source the staff.<\/p>  <p>  I can list dozens of individual cases, as most Deputies can, regarding the much-needed hours allocated to various people where, for one reason or another, the HSE is failing to allocate a carer to them or to arrange for a service provider to be contracted to do the same.  I think of one lady in particular who is 92 years of age.  She is a dementia sufferer who has been waiting more than 12 months for a carer.  After many representations and having waited that length of time, she eventually got half of her entitlement but is still waiting for her full allocation.  This is being felt right across the board.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the reluctance up to now may have related to the fact that certain providers do not meet the same pay and conditions standards set by the HSE itself.  These contracts and working visas require a minimum salary of &euro;27,000 in other circumstances and while this approximate salary is not as high as the HSE hourly rate of &euro;16.50 an hour, nonetheless, it is a reasonable starting salary for many of these workers.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister and the Department to revise the criteria for the critical skills occupation list.  Let us deliver the whole allocation of hours and get the urgent care that these elderly and vulnerable people need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400055#EEE00700","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1655241000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  He is right it is one that we are aware of, as a Department and as a Government.  It has been raised often through questions in the House, with the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, also saying that this is something he felt might be addressed and looked at through the permit process this year.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is working in the area and has put together the strategic workforce working group to look at this.  It is due to report back in September.  As I will be taking a Topical Issue matter on that later, I will not give the full answer in respect of it now.  However, it is an issue she is trying to address.  I have engaged with her on it to see if, before September, there are ways we can bring forward solutions under the categories the Deputy has mentioned in regard to permits.  It is something we are aware of and are looking at.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that many families are waiting for support.  The funding is approved through the Government and its Departments, but it is having the personnel to implement this that we need to try to address.  We need to look at it as a combination of solutions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is taking the long-term view on how to address this permanently through a workforce planning process.  Hopefully, that report will give us something to work on come the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the issues around the upcoming review of the permanent situation and how it can be addressed, I want to explain what the permits scheme is about.  Ireland's employment permit system is designed to accommodate the arrival of non-EEA nationals to fill skills and labour gaps for the benefit of our economy in the short to medium term, but this objective must be balanced with the need to ensure there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.  The Deputy will know this as he has often engaged with the system, and quite successfully too.<\/p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations list which determines employments that are either in high demand or ineligible for an employment permit, where there is evidence that there should be sufficient availability of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.  In order to ensure that the employment permit system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo regular evidence-based review guided by relevant research and published stakeholder consultation, and incorporate the views of the economic migration interdepartmental group, which includes representatives from the Department of Health.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Account is also taken of upskilling and training initiatives and other known contextual factors such as the ending of the pandemic unemployment payment schemes, the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis and their impact on the labour market.  Currently, home care workers are not eligible for an employment permit, as Deputy O'Sullivan correctly flagged.  While submissions from the home care sector were considered, the most recently concluded review announced last October did not recommend removal of the occupation of care workers and home care workers from the ineligible occupations list as the evidence suggested that the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage.  Since then I have engaged with some of the providers in the sector to try to analyse this data with them and to highlight that it is a concern for us that a high percentage of the workers in the sector work part time which points to the possibility that maybe there is an option to have long-term contracts or full hour contracts as well.  They understand our concerns and I understand they are now preparing a submission for the next review which will come up quite soon.<\/p> <p> In order to add or remove an occupation from the lists, evidence is sought demonstrating that recruitment difficulties are solely due to genuine shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary or employment conditions.  This is what I outlined in my meetings with the sector and also in conversation with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  Sectors in general are also required to engage structurally with the public employment service of the Department of Social Protection.  The review process invites stakeholders through the public consultation to provide data to substantiate claims of lack of skills or labour available in a detailed evidence-based business case.  While Deputy O'Sullivan correctly highlighted the need from the client point of view and from the point of view of patients who need help and home care, we also expect the providers to show they have made every effort to source staff and to provide good pay and terms and conditions within Ireland and the EEA and to engage with the Department of Social Protection.  A longer term approach is required, as was touched on at the start by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, but in the short term, there will be an opportunity when we open this system again for review of employment permits to make those conditions and have evidence to show it.  I hope to have that review open within the next couple of weeks.  Then we will be able to judge that over the coming time period and make a decision.  Hopefully, it will be timely.  In doing that, I will consult directly with the Department of Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to see if we can find a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400055#EEE00800","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655241600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The Minister of State said the sector must demonstrate that the requirement is there for the additional intake of employees from non-EU countries.  The most demonstrable fact of that is that hundreds of thousands of hours are not being utilised.  If there was ever a business case to be made, surely that is it.  I hope the Department takes that into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I have to agree with the Minister of State, Deputy English on the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has done a good job since assuming office.  She has increased the budget considerably and the number of hours since taking over, as I referenced in my opening statement.  She has accumulated an additional 5 million hours per annum, which is much needed.  Those hours are useless unless people can avail of them.  I genuinely hope this can be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the advisory group deliberating in the next couple of months.  It is now very important that we get people the care they need.  As I said earlier, national policy is to keep people at home as comfortable as possible, giving them their care needs in their own homes as well as possible.  This kind of move would provide for that.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I understand the visa requirement is that these employees would earn a minimum of &euro;27,000 but the sector needs to work on that.  Given that many of its staff are part time, it might be able to expand the workforce, improve pay and conditions by doing that.  Even a rudimentary sum done on &euro;27,000 a year at 39 hours a week shows it would be equivalent to about &euro;13.50 or &euro;14 an hour, which is above the minimum wage but below the HSE wage.  However, &euro;27,000 is not a wage to be sniffed at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400056#FFF00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1655241600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this scenario.  We know there are many people who have been approved for hours and need help and it is Government policy to keep people at home as long as possible and to give them the care and support they need to be able to do that.  We are very much focused on that and we will work with officials and all Departments to try to make it happen.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, Department officials are actively engaged with the Department of Health in regard to the recruitment challenges outlined and my Department is a member of the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group chaired by the Department of Health.  Areas being considered by that group include recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions, and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future.  In some areas where we sanction the use of a permit, it involves training as well.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the rate of &euro;27,000, which was set for healthcare assistants last April and which was more than a year ago.  That does not have to be the exact amount of money.  It can vary for different sectors and different areas but we try to be at the high end.  We do not want to undercut the market by bringing in talent from abroad.  A figure of that order sounds appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The group the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, chairs provides a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address these workforce challenges in the sector and will develop a set of recommendations for the Minister of Health's consideration outlining the group&rsquo;s key findings and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations by September 2022.  Naturally we hoped that report would have been finished in time to feed into our review of the permits but it does not look like it will be.<\/p>  <p>  The timing of our next review of the occupational list in regard to permits will be kept under consideration by my Department in the context of clearing the current employment permits backlog.  It is intended to have it open in the next few weeks if we can do so.  We usually have it open around June or July most years, and again in the autumn.  When open submissions will be invited from sector representative bodies and interested parties via the public consultation forum accessible on my Department&rsquo;s website throughout the consultation period.<\/p>  <p>  I will happily engage with the various sectors to make a very strong case.  However, it will be important that we capture the evidence that shows every effort was made to try to recruit people on decent contracts, with decent pay, locally and within Europe.

The amazing thing is allegations were made of 16 uninsured vehicles, one which was in a crash and was not insured; locally arranged leasing of Aasleagh Lodge to a member of the staff as a guest house with no transparency, no process or no financial arrangements and inappropriate disbursement of Dormant Accounts Fund money to a club that did not exist at the time, but which was then created.  Except in the past year, the protection crews in certain coastal areas did not do any work, resulting in the need to mobilise a mobile response unit at a considerable cost.  What happened then?  There was no investigation into the CEO or the Department but the Minister appointed somebody to investigate the board.  To be fair to the board, it had signalled all of these problems and issues but could not get a response from the CEO.  The board did everything that was asked of it.  It was a marvellous board and it had a great chairman, but there were difficulties with the CEO and the Department.<\/p>  <p>  As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, knows, because he is here as long as I am, the State is never investigated or prosecuted or has anything done to it.  It amazes me that this is put into the statement on internal control, which is submitted on 31 March every year, that the matters of concern are then reported to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that the board instructs the CEO and executive to arrange an external investigation into these matters and submit the report to the board and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That proves the board did everything right.  Why then did the Minister need to appoint somebody to investigate the board?  Why does he not get somebody to investigate the CEO or the Department?  The only place this goes on is in Russia with Putin.  It would not happen anywhere else.  It is going on in this country.<\/p> <p>I want to ask a few questions of the Minister.  Where were the auditors and when they saw these problems, what did they do about them?  The Comptroller and Auditor General is preparing a report.  Where is that report at this stage?  Why is this not sent to the Standards in Public Office Commission?  Why are they not investigating this?  Maybe the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be investigating it.<\/p> <p> What does the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, do?  He appoints someone to investigate the board.  The board, that is there in a voluntary capacity, is a well-run board that did a great job.  There have been many difficulties with the chief executives, there have been many difficulties with the Department and now we have a situation where the board is being investigated.<\/p> <p> I am sick and tired.  I am coming into this House for a long time.  I saw what went on with the local authority.  We saw the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  What did the public service do?  Like it always does, it covered up.  Nothing has been done since the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  If it was the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, or if it was Deputy MacSharry or any other Deputy in this House, we would have the Standards in Public Office Commission down on us in a minute.  They would not have to be even told.  Where are they now?  Why are they not investigating Inland Fisheries Ireland?  Why are they not investigating the local authorities?  Are there two laws in this country?  Is there one for the public service, one for the elected representatives, one for the board members and one for the CEO?  That is all I want to say for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400056#FFF00500","speaker":"1500","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655242200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this issue.

Subsequently, the assertions made were the subject of inaccurate media reports relating to Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI.  These reports suggested significant irregularities have been identified in the organisation, including issues in relation to the Dormant Accounts Fund, procurement, vehicle insurance, use of IFI vessels and the leasing of a property.  These assertions were fully addressed on a number of occasions in both Houses setting out the detailed factual position.<\/p><p>The fact is that these issues have been previously considered and addressed through, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the then chairman of the board's statutory statement of internal control, external audit reviews, correspondence between IFI and the Department, and the IFI board's own assessment of these matters which the Department has accepted.<\/p><p>In particular, it should also be noted that the suggestion made in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 5 May 2022, and carried in various media reports, that IFI grant aided, via funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund, an angling club that &quot;did not exist&quot; is entirely inaccurate.  IFI has confirmed that the club in question was established before funds were applied for, has a club constitution, bank account and tax clearance certificate, and is affiliated to the Irish Federation of Sea Angling Clubs.<\/p><p>It has also been suggested in the various media reports that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, had appointed a senior counsel to examine these matters.  The Minister wants to make clear this is inaccurate.  As set out above, the Department fully accepts the former chair's and board's assurances that these issues-allegations have been addressed, are being addressed or should be entirely refuted.<\/p><p>The Department has appointed Mr. Conleth Bradley SC under section 18 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 - which section is entitled &quot;Removal of Members from Office&quot;, members being members of the board of IFI - to carry out a review of the exercise by the board of its functions under the Act.<\/p><p>The focus of the section 18 review by Mr. Bradley SC is quite specific and relates to issues raised in correspondence between the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and board members of IFI during the period 1 Feb and 27 April.  It includes letters of 4 March and 7 April from the Department to the then chairman of the board, Mr. Fintan Gorman, the letter of 22 April from the then chairman to the Department, and email notifications and subsequent letters from other board members.<\/p><p>As part of the review and as required under section 18(4) of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, IFI board members - including those who were members between the above dates but who have since resigned - management and personnel are required to co-operate with the review and provide assistance to Mr. Bradley SC.  Engagement with all relevant persons is a matter for Mr. Bradley SC before he completes his report for the Minister.<\/p><p>The review does not in any way relate to the matters raised in both D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann and in subsequent media reports during May 2022.<\/p><p>It is important to note that these matters are addressed in audit reviews and in the statement of internal control, signed off by the chairman of the board earlier this year, and which is required to form part of IFI's annual report for 2021.<\/p><p>The chairman&rsquo;s report on behalf of the board indicates that issues identified have been addressed, IFI assets are being appropriately managed and other allegations can be fully refuted by IFI.  I reiterate that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his Department have fully accepted the assurances of the board in this regard.<\/p><p>As members of this House will be aware, annual reports and accounts, including annual statements of internal control, are prepared by all public bodies, including IFI.  These documents are required to be submitted annually, as a matter of course, to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General before being laid before both Houses.<\/p><p>I emphasise that the suggestion that matters already addressed in the relevant IFI statement of internal control and audit reviews have been subsequently specifically or explicitly submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General outside of the well-established and normal process is simply untrue.  IFI's normal annual submission, including the assurances on behalf of the board, to the Comptroller and Auditor General was made on 31 March last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400057#GGG00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1655242200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Meaning no disrespect, I do not accept what the Minister of State, Deputy English, has said.

I raised this issue, and asked my colleagues to do so as well, because many farmers all over the country are concerned about the rise in the price of agricultural diesel.<\/p><p>Last night, I attended an Irish Farmers Association, IFA, meeting in Ballymote mart.  There were many farmers there who are concerned about the rising input costs for their work.  This morning I heard on the radio that farm incomes are up, and we welcome that.  Farmers in some sectors are doing much better than they had been from the point of view of the prices they are getting.  It was acknowledged by the farmers last night that cattle and sheep prices are up.  Although those prices are up, they have not doubled.  I say this because the cost of everything else seems to have doubled and more than doubled.  Certainly, the price of fertiliser has doubled and, in some cases, tripled.  The price of agricultural diesel was something that they had a particular focus on because we are coming into the time of year when many farmers are trying to get their silage cut and wrapped.  All of those costs are going up as well.<\/p><p>The farmers focused particularly on diesel.  They made the valid point that the price of agricultural diesel is approximately &euro;1.50 per litre at the moment.  Therefore, 1,000 l of diesel costs them &euro;1,500.  This time last year it cost &euro;0.78 per litre.  It cost &euro;780 per 1,000 l.  It has therefore doubled in price.  There was a man present last night who is in the road haulage business and has trucks.  He is buying white diesel as well.  The cost of white diesel has also gone up, although it has not gone up to the same extent.  If there was a<i>pro rata <\/i>rise with agricultural diesel costs doubling, one would expect that road diesel would double as well and would be over &euro;3 per litre now, but it is not.  As we know, it is still very high, at approximately &euro;2.10 to &euro;2.15 per litre around the country.  This is an issue on which there needs to be a focus.  The Government may say that it has done little bits of tinkering around with excise duties but the reality is that enough has not been done to help this sector, which needs a break in regard to these costs, particularly the costs around agricultural diesel.<\/p><p>The other issue that was acknowledged by farmers last night is that there is pressure on the farming community across Ireland and indeed across Europe to be more self-sufficient, to grow more food and to produce more food.  This is particularly the case in the context of the crisis in Ukraine.  The outcome of that is that we have a food security crisis as well as a cost-of-living crisis and an oil crisis.  That puts pressure on the farming community to produce the goods.  If they can produce the goods, they will do so.  They will do their very best to do that.  They are prepared to do that.  However, they need a break in regard to the input costs anywhere the Government can help them, particularly around the issues of fertiliser and diesel.  The Minister of State will acknowledge that the same problems are found in his constituency, where farmers are paying very high prices for diesel.  The Government needs to sit up and listen to this plea.  It needs to do something to get that cost down.  There is no point in taking it down by 5 cent or 10 cent per litre and then coming out with a carbon tax that puts it back up by 5 or 10 cent per litre, which has happened in the past.  We need to get something real that will have a benefit to farmers so they can see that their Government cares about ensuring they will be in a position to increase their production, to grow more food and to ensure there will not be a food security crisis across Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400058#HHH00500","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1655242800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this important issue.  As he correctly said, it is an issue in many parts of the country, including his area of counties Leitrim and Sligo and my own area of County Meath.  Farmers, like anybody in business, are under extreme pressure with the price of energy, the price of fuel and the prices in general.  The Deputy is right that there have been some good times, given the recent increases in the prices they get for their own products.  However, those increases have been a long way off from being double, which is what the farmers are having to pay for fertiliser, foodstuffs or energy.<\/p>  <p>  There is pressure on the agricultural sector.  There is no doubt about that.  It is an important sector to Ireland.  We want to protect it and to continue to work with it.  When we came out of the last financial crash, we saw that agriculture and food production were major assets to this country.  They are playing a major role in the current jobs-led recovery too.  We want to work with this valuable sector and to address some of the costs pressures it is under.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, could not be here today.  I will give the answer on his behalf and on behalf of his Department.  The Government understands the background to this Topical Issue matter and recognises that there is a real issue with the rising cost of fuel for the agricultural sector, as Deputy Kenny and others have genuinely raised.  However, it has to be stated at the outset that we are living in unprecedented times.  While the Government is doing everything within its power to assist the economy as a whole, including the agriculture sector, there are limitations to what it can do.  In other words, it cannot completely insulate completely sectors of the economy from the impact of issues such as the war in Ukraine, which are completely outside of its control.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the application of excise on agricultural fuels, the Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty in the form of mineral oil tax, MOT, to specified mineral oils used as motor or heating fuels.  MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component.  The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax.  The non-carbon component is often referred to as excise, fuel excise or fuel duty.<\/p>  <p>  Diesel used for certain purposes, for example in agricultural machinery, may qualify for a reduced rate of MOT.  Such diesel must be marked with prescribed fiscal markers and is referred to as marked gas oil, MGO, green diesel or farm-agricultural diesel.  The current reduced rate of MOT that applies to MGO is &euro;111.14 per 1,000 l.  This is considerably less than the standard rate of MOT on diesel used as a propellant which is currently &euro;405.38 per 1,000 l.<\/p>  <p>   In March of this year, in response to the global fuel crisis, the Minister for Finance introduced cuts to MOT rates on petrol, diesel and MGO.  He introduced a further cut to the MOT rate on MGO from 1 May to run until 11 October this year.  This rate cut applies to the non-carbon component of MOT and fully compensates for the carbon tax increase.  As a result of the measures introduced, all MGO users benefit from a cut of more than 5 cent per litre inclusive of VAT from 1 May until 11 October.  In addition to benefiting from the reduced MOT rate on MGO, farmers may also claim a tax deduction for expenditure incurred on MGO.<\/p>  <p>  In computing their taxable farming profits, farmers may also benefit from a relief provided under section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This relief allows a farmer to claim an additional deduction for MGO, which amounts to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 l of farm diesel, which was the 2012 baseline figure.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth mentioning that the MOT law provides for a relief from the carbon component of MOT for biofuels that are made of biomass of animal or vegetal origin.  This means that a fuel that is entirely made from biomass would be liable for the non-carbon component of MOT only.  In the case of such a biofuel used in place of MGO, the MOT carbon component would be fully relieved.  For blended fuels containing biomass, the relief applies to the portion of fuel that meets the biofuel criteria set out in the MOT legislation.  The biofuel relief is intended to promote a higher level of biofuel in fuel sales and supports the Government's commitment to incentivising the use of greener alternatives to fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, and in response to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s questions, the Government will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and to work with our European partners to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal.  There will be more initiatives brought forward in the summer and in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400058#HHH00600","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1655242800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I accept the reply that the Minister of State has given on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Changes were made.  We can read out at length the data and the tables regarding the various taxes and tax rates, etc., but the reality for the farmer is that when they go to fill a 5-gallon drum with diesel, it is costing them twice the price.  That is the reality.  There needs to be a check on that.<\/p>  <p>  From speaking to the farmers last night, and from speaking to other farmers since then, I emphasise that farmers need to see a reduction to below &euro;1.20 per litre.  That is what they are asking for.  It is at &euro;1.50 per litre now.  It needs to go at least below &euro;1.20 per litre.  That is still a very large increase on what they had this time last year.  However, that is what they are asking for.  I am asking the Minister of State to bring that message back to the Minister for Finance.  That is the message that we need to get through.

The question will then arise as to where we will get our food.<\/p> <p> While there may be headline figures showing that farming family incomes are up, the reality for many farmers, certainly in my part of the country and especially for farmers who are dependent on sucklers and sheep, is that their incomes are very low.  Even if incomes trebled from what they are now, never mind going up by 30% or 40% on last year, those farmers would still on low incomes.  In fact, if one added up the hours they put into their work, they are on well below the minimum wage, as bad as it is in this country.  They need a commitment that the Government will bring the price of agricultural diesel below &euro;1.20 a litre, which is what I am asking the Minister to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400058#HHH00700","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655243400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot give that commitment tonight, as much as I might want to do so.  I will take his very clear request back to the Minister for Finance and the Department.  This issue has been flagged in the engagements that have been taking place with the agricultural community over the past few weeks.  The Deputy has proposed a clear target of bringing the price below &euro;1.20.  I certainly understand the pressure farmers and contractors are under, as does the Minister.  Like many others in various sectors, it is very hard to make ends meet and make business pay.  Even though farmers can receive a decent price for their product, the input costs have increased dramatically for everybody in farming, as they have in other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  This issue has been well flagged and identified by the Government.  There has been a response, as I outlined, to try to take some off the pressure off, not just in regard to fuel costs but in different ways as well.  The whole area is being kept under review by the Government.  All the Departments have been feeding into the budget process over recent weeks and will continue to do so through June and July, focusing on how best we can respond to this issue and the pressures it is putting on the sector.  The farming sector is very important, as the Deputy noted, because of the need for food security and the food shortages we will see coming out of what is happening in Ukraine.  The matter certainly will get attention from the Minister and I will be sure to convey the points the Deputy has raised.  I will make sure the Minister hears them first-hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400059#JJJ00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","time":1655243400,"counter":518,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400059#JJJ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1655243400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a few points on this issue.  In the context of a previous matter, another Deputy appealed to the Minister of State to make work permits available to people who are prepared to join the workforce in Ireland as carers because there is such a shortage of staff in this area.  I would support that as something which may help to address the problem.  We are reaping the rewards of a very short-sighted approach taken some ten to 12 years ago, when financial challenges were to the forefront and when the HSE, in effect, changed its strategy of recruiting home help workers into its permanent staff and instead farmed the service out to private agencies.  This led to a growth in such agencies, which are being paid X and are paying the carers who provide the service Y.  We are seeing a mass exodus of staff from the private agencies offering home help care.  While the HSE is beginning to try to recruit in order to ensure that we have appropriate staff numbers, there is a crisis in the here and now.<\/p>  <p>  I offer one example of a dependent person needing home help provision who will not recover.  In this instance, it is not a rehabilitation situation; it is about the provision of care to end of life.  This individual has a very generous package of 42 hours per week, but only 26 of those hours can be delivered because of the shortage of staff prepared to do the work and who are available, either through agencies or from the HSE.  This person's situation is indicative of an emergency that will lead to an exponential growth in the numbers attending hospitals unnecessarily, in the delays for discharge and in demands for nursing home beds.  All of this, in turn, will put our entire health service into chaos.<\/p>  <p>  While I am conscious that public pay talks will be commencing soon, we cannot wait two years for agreement.  We need to be prepared to pay home carers an appropriate level of remuneration and expenses consistent with the astronomical rises in fuel and other expenses relevant to this area.  This is not something that can wait for reviews, sub-committees, consultants' reports or anything like that.  Somebody has to take the bull by the horns and take action now because, otherwise, it will cost too much in terms of the spin-off problems that will arise in our wider health service.  We must increase the pay rates and remuneration for home care staff and ensure that they receive adequate expenses to look after the people who are rehabilitating at home and, in line with our national policy, those who are in the twilight of their lives and require full-time care at home.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, she is making all the hours available.  The problem is we are not paying the correct rates to get the job done.  There is a superficial granting of hours, as in the case of the poor patient to whom I referred.  That individual has been given 42 hours but, in reality, only 26 can be delivered.  This is unsustainable.  I would like to see us dealing with this crisis with the same gusto, can-do attitude and speed with which we were prepared to take measures in the management of the Covid crisis and, indeed, in welcoming our Ukrainian friends who have been running for their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400059#JJJ00400","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1655243400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue, which affects many people, and their families, who are in need of home care throughout the country.  It is an issue that has been discussed a great deal in this House with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has been addressing it in a number of ways.  The Minister of State could not be here tonight and has asked me to take the matter on her behalf.  I certainly will convey the Deputy's clear message to her.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very much committed to the development of improved community-based services, shifting care to the home and offering greater choice for older people to be able to remain at home for as long as possible.  We want to ensure the people who need that care can receive it, including the person to whom the Deputy referred, for whom more than 40 hours was approved.  In budget 2021, the Minister of State secured additional funding of &euro;150 million for home support to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services and provide 5 million additional hours of home support.  The funding secured in budget 2021 to provide those additional 5 million hours has been maintained for 2022.  In 2021, some 20.4 million hours were provided to more than 55,000 people.  This is approximately 2.9 million more hours, or an increase of 17%, compared with 2020.  That increase was needed because, as the Deputy noted, demand is up.  Preliminary activity data currently available show that in the period to the end of April 2022, some 6.9 million home support hours were delivered nationally to just under 55,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  Significant inroads have been achieved in reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional service from more than 7,800 in January 2020 to 302 in April 2022.  This reduction has been achieved through a combination of validation of the waiting lists and availability of additional funding to address those waiting.  However, there can be a lag between funding approval and the delivery of home support hours.  Certain geographical areas that are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability are particularly affected.  At the end of April, provisional information shows there were 5,344 people for whom funding for home support had been approved and who were waiting for a carer to be assigned.  It is important to note that the total number of people waiting for home support has reduced from more than 9,000 at the start of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting egress from acute hospitals is a key priority of the Government, and each community healthcare organisation area has dedicated staff working closely with the hospitals.  As of 7 June, 531 patients nationally were waiting to be discharged from hospital.  A total of 96 patients were waiting to be discharged home with home supports, with 59 waiting on a carer to become available.  Transitional care funding continues to be in place on a demand-led basis to support patients discharging from acute hospital to long-stay care and for patients who require convalescence care before returning home.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE continues to advertise on an ongoing basis throughout the country for healthcare support assistants and to recruit as many suitable candidates as possible.  Due to the nature of the role, this recruitment is normally conducted at a very local level.  In addition, approved private home support providers continue to recruit home support workers.  The Minister of State is very much aware of the strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing homes sector.  In recent weeks, she has had meetings with the HSE to discuss the potential of a renewed focus on advertising these positions locally.  There is a renewed effort to recruit the staff to provide the care.  She has also established a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group to examine issues such as recruitment, retention, training and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future, with a view to ensuring that solutions can be identified and implemented.<\/p> <p>It is also expected that the pay and conditions for these workers will be examined.  The Deputy asked that these facets be examined.  He also said an urgent decision was needed, but this work now looks like it will be due to complete early in September, with recommendations being provided.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, wishes to achieve the goal of ensuring there is an adequate supply of appropriately-skilled healthcare support assistants.  That is a key aim of this initiative.  Hopefully, therefore, the report and this work will bring some success in September.  <\/p> <p> I also engaged with the Minister of State regarding the permanent option.  We made changes in April 2021 to the healthcare assistant role in nursing home settings, but not in home settings.  This aspect is one that can be reappraised in the next review, which will commence soon.  A major part of the focus, however, must be on the terms and conditions and what contracts are on offer.  I refer to them being full time, because the terms are generally concerned with those types of contracts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400059#JJJ00500","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655244000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we are doing exactly what I said we should not do, in respect of having a group for this, a chat about that, an expert group on the other and a cross-departmental team on something else.  The reality is that this is a problem now.  When we get to early autumn and into winter, it is going to be a much worse problem.  We must pay home carers more money and remunerate them for adequate expenses, especially given the astronomical rise in costs.  If we do not do that, then we will have a major problem in our hospitals, nursing homes, etc., later this year.  It will be much worse.  It is already bad, but it will be much worse then.<\/p>  <p>  My point is that when we want to and when we are under the glare of the international spotlight regarding our reactions, which we all welcome in respect of helping our Ukrainian friends, we can pay thousands of euro every week to house people and to ensure they are looked after.  Indeed, if the Secretary General of the Department of Health needs an extra &euro;80,000, we can do that overnight as well.  It is as clear as the nose on my face why there is a recruitment problem in this area.  Let us address it, look after people who are rehabilitating and in the twilight of their lives and keep the pressure off our hospitals and nursing homes.  They are already under pressure.  The Minister of State will bring what I am saying back to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I understand she is otherwise engaged this evening.  I very much hope, however, instead of there being the usual administrative merry-go-round, which we tend to embrace and then say something has been dealt with, that we can use the same can-do, let-us-get-it-done attitude as we did when dealing with Covid-19 and the Ukrainian refugee crisis.  I do not see the same level of urgency and the same can-do attitude manifested when it comes to looking after our own and I would like to see it in this instance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061400060#KKK00200","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1655244000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy MacSharry again.  He is asking a fair question regarding whether we can get some quicker decision-making on this matter as well.  It is not just an issue concerning pay and conditions, but the Deputy has identified these aspects as the main reason.  Part of the work the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is doing involves trying to determine these reasons.  It also includes travel arrangements, the hours on offer in respect of full-time versus part-time work and the unsocial nature of those hours.  It is also difficult work and a difficult service to provide.  Not everyone is fit to do the work of a carer or a healthcare assistant in a home or nursing home.  It is only certain individuals who can do it.  The Deputy raised the point that these people need to be well paid and looked after.  I will certainly bring the Deputy's points back to the Minister of State.  She is determined to resolve this issue.  I will also bring back the suggestions made by Deputy MacSharry.
