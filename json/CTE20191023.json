I shall first give the committee a little background to the policy framework on peatlands and then I will speak about the national peatlands strategy and peatlands restoration.<\/p> <p>  Peatlands cover approximately 20% of the State's land area and their use has implications across a wide spectrum of public policy.  Ireland's peatlands, occurring as raised bogs, blankets bogs or fens are unique on a national and global scale.  Ireland recognised the importance of these peatlands and took steps to protect these sites through designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, and natural heritage areas, NHAs.<\/p> <p>  The national peatlands strategy has run since 2015 and has as its vision statement \"to provide a long-term framework within which all of the peatlands within the State can be managed responsibly in order to optimise their social, environmental and economic contribution to the well-being of this and future generations\".<\/p> <p>  The strategy sets out a cross-governmental approach to managing issues that relate to peatlands, including compliance with national and EU environmental law, climate change, forestry, flood control, energy, nature conservation, planning and agriculture.  It is underlined by 25 key principles and commits to the undertaking of 32 actions across various sectors and themes, including research, tourism, agriculture, forestry, conservation, restoration, peat extraction, energy, water quality and climate change.<\/p> <p>  The strategy has a timeframe of ten years and will be subject to a mid-cycle review in 2020.  The publication of the first progress report on the implementation of the national peatlands strategy was approved by the Government and the report was published last year.  Work on the second progress report is ongoing with a view to publication by the end of this year or early in 2020<\/p> <p> As I have said, there are 32 actions in the strategy and I will give a flavour of progress on some of the actions.  Among the progress to be reported is action No. 3 where the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's European innovation partnerships, ElPs, programme has awarded a total of &euro;59 million to 24 projects.  Many of these are within Natura 2000 areas such as the hen harrier project and the pearl mussel project.<\/p> <p>  Action No. 5 is a key issues paper for public consultation on a review of the use of peat in the horticultural industry that has recently been published.  Submissions are invited on the key issues paper during the three month period closing on 20 January 2020.  A copy of the paper has been sent to the Chairman of this committee and that of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p>  Action No. 8 is Bord na M&oacute;na's announcement that all Bord na M&oacute;na lands used for peat production will be rehabilitated in the long term in accordance with draft plans supplied to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It also recently announced an accelerated exit strategy for peat production and its intention for an enhanced rehabilitation programme.<\/p> <p>  With regard to action No. 13, currently two eddy covariance towers have been established in the midlands on peatland sites with a further tower to be installed next year as part of the accelerated bog restoration programme.  These flux towers are used as a tool for evaluating net CO2 or other gases exchange from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere.<\/p> <p>  With action No. 14 the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to jointly fund a two-year research project titled: \"The vulnerability of peatland ecosystems to a changing climate and increases in the frequency and severity of droughts.\"  The project is scheduled to begin next year.<\/p> <p>  For action No. 27, in July 2019, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, approved grant funding of just under &euro;131,000 under the peatlands community engagement scheme, to 13 local community groups and organisations, with &euro;16,245 in pre-funding to be provided to seven of these groups as start-up funding.<\/p> <p>  I shall conclude by referring to the Irish and international experience of wetland restoration.  As recognised in the Government's Climate Action Plan 2019, restored peatlands are important carbon sinks, absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon as well as supporting improved biodiversity across Ireland.  In December 2017, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht published the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022.  The management plan sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  This restoration programme links with the peatland actions contained in the Government's Climate Action Plan 2019 and actions contained in the national peatlands strategy.<\/p> <p>  In budget 2020, &euro;5 million has been allocated to embark on an accelerated programme of peatland restoration.  With the injection of this funding, it is intended to restore over 1,800 ha of protected raised bog in the next year.  Work on the restoration programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project - the living bog - which is funded under the EU LIFE 2014 - 2020 programme.  The Department, including the LIFE project team, has worked with international peatland experts to further hone its expertise in raised bog restoration  In tandem with the LIFE project, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department is undertaking restoration works on State-owned lands within the designated raised bog network.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for inviting the Department to make this presentation and I am willing to answer any questions that members may have for the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Lucas"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lucas very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#D00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators, ladies and gentlemen.  Peatlands are unique ecosystems in the context of the global carbon cycle.  This is because in addition to being home to rare biodiversity, peatlands are the largest and most concentrated global store of carbon of all terrestrial ecosystems, containing twice the carbon of the forest biomass.  The accumulation of vast quantities of carbon occurred over many thousands of years is thanks to the permanently waterlogged conditions that prevent the complete decomposition of organic matter.  In Ireland, peat soils are the largest carbon store containing an estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon.  Total global carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from degraded peatlands currently amount to a third of the total emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, sector and is equivalent to 5% of the total global anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  In Ireland, peatland drainage for either domestic turf cutting, energy, horticulture, agriculture and forestry releases carbon that under normal conditions would have remained in storage within the peatlands.  Burning peat is a source of air pollution and drained cut bogs no longer function as a refuge for rare species nor as a repository for historical artefacts, for example.<\/p> <p>  Natural peatlands have acted, and continue to act, as carbon sinks but drained peatlands and related activities account for emissions of some 11 million tonnes of CO2 per year in Ireland.  This equates to total emissions from the energy sector in 2018.  The total emissions from the 11 million tonnes is composed of power station peat burning, domestic turf cutting, horticultural peat and, most important, from the drained peat bogs.<\/p><p>A key figure to bear in mind is that 1 ha of drained bog, whether cutover or cutaway, emits six tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>per year for each year that it remains dry.  Less than 50,000 ha of the original 310,000 ha of raised bog in Ireland remains uncut.  More critically, only 1% is in an active condition, meaning it is sequestering carbon by accumulating peat.  There are more green parks in Dublin city than there are active, peat forming raised bogs in the country.The same threats have also decimated the original 774,000 ha of blanket bog, with now less than 28% likely to be in conservation value, barely holding on to their carbon stores.  The proportion of active areas is still unknown in those blanket bogs but it is likely to be critically low and decreasing each year as a national management plan for the network of blanket bogs SACs has not yet been established.<br\/><br\/>The protection, restoration and rewetting of peatlands is in line with national and EU obligations.  Undrained and uncut bogs are amongst those that are accorded priority habitat status in recognition of the extent of historical destruction of such habitats across Europe.  It is a legal requirement to preserve all peatlands that are still mostly uncut and undrained and to aim to restore the high bog or uncut part.  The network of 53 SAC raised bogs is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the carbon store of peatlands.  While the proper restoration of this network will lock in 28 million tonnes of carbon, the high bog within the NHA network also requires action.  What about the blanket bogs?  Members should recall that the area of blanket bog is three times greater than the area of raised bog.  As such, Ireland could lock in ten times more carbon in the designated blanket bog network if only the management plan required by law under the habitats directive could be implemented for these rare ecosystems.<br\/><br\/>I turn to restoration and rewetting.  When rewetted, degraded peatlands stop emitting and instead lock in their carbon store.  Better still, when they are restored, peatlands can even return to acting as natural carbon capture systems.  To clarify, even if peat cutting were to cease and no efforts were made to block the drains, peat will continue to decompose and release carbon to the atmosphere until rewetted.  The minimum intervention is therefore to rewet.  Before I go further, I will clarify a few terms, namely, &quot;restoration&quot;, &quot;rewetting&quot; and &quot;rehabilitation&quot;, as there is confusion about them.  The following definitions come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's wetlands supplement for 2014.  The supplement states that peatland restoration aims to permanently re-establish the ecosystem that existed before disturbance or land-use change.  The restoration of drained peats almost always requires rewetting.  The latter is the deliberate action of raising the water table on drained soils to re-establish water saturated conditions.  Rewetting can be accomplished by blocking drainage ditches or disabling pumping facilities and managing the water table so that it remains close to the surface.  Rewetting can have several objectives, such as wetland restoration, and may allow other management practices on saturated peat soils, such as paludiculture, or wet agriculture.  Rehabilitation<b><\/b>can involve a large variety of practices which may or may not include rewetting.<br\/><br\/>Restoration of our protected peatlands and rewetting of drained bogs are considered by the UN as low-hanging fruit and among the most cost-effective options for mitigating climate change.  In both restoration and rewetting, the water table must be managed.  Abandoning or re-flooding drained peat soils under the heading &quot;rehabilitation&quot; is not a climate-friendly action as both approaches release huge amounts of greenhouse gases.  The feasibility of peatland restoration has been demonstrated in a number of countries, including Ireland. We have found that cutover bogs can be fully restored to return their carbon sequestration and storage function, as well as their unique biodiversity.  In Canada, scientists and those in the peat industry have worked together to licence peat extraction but that has come hand in hand with a commitment to fully restore the site after the short period of extraction has ceased.  The Irish industry must be regulated and look to such international standard.  Industrial cutaways have been drained and have emitted CO<sub>2<\/sub>for as many as 70 years and cutover bogs have done the same for centuries.  Restoration should be supported where conditions are adequate but where that is not possible, the minimum required intervention should be rewetting<b>.<\/b><br\/><br\/>Peatlands and future climate change are important aspects of this topic.  Drained peatlands are extremely vulnerable to even modest climate change impacts and are projected to become even greater hotspots of greenhouse gases as the peat dries out, cracks or burns.  Rewetting of these degraded bogs has been shown to be a climate-proof, effective mitigation strategy, provided that extreme drying events like summer drought do not become a more frequent occurrence.  Importantly, the longer a rewetted bog is established, the more resilient it will be to climate change.<br\/><br\/>Our recommendations are as follows.  The restoration of active bog habitats within all raised and blanket bogs SACs must be implemented rapidly in order to be climate-resilient.  Rewetting is a low-hanging-fruit mitigation measure that must be applied to all publicly owned peatlands, wherever feasible.  It is not sufficient to stop peat extraction or ban unsustainable uses of peatlands.  Rewetting is a mitigation measure that should also be included in the range of governmental climate adaptation tool kits to help landowners to farm carbon.  This action is critical to safeguard the future of the massive amount of carbon locked in all peat soils and which will bring associated ecosystem services, including water quality and regulation and biodiversity.  Regulatory frameworks and legislation across governmental agencies must be put in place to ensure the sustainable management of peatlands and to support voluntary mechanisms, for example, funds, certification, payments for ecosystem services.  Local communities should be supported by adequate funding to help them participate in the rewetting and restoration of their local bogs which are part of our social fabric and cultural heritage.  The rewetting of industrial cutaway and large cutover bogs is a low-cost intervention approach that would support immediate and effective climate change mitigation measures.  Such mitigation measures should be integrated as requirements in association with other sustainable after-use options to avoid exacerbating global warming.  Given the policy vacuum in this area, I recommend that a task force be establish to oversee the after-use of cutaway peatlands in accordance with climate and sustainability objectives.<br\/><br\/>Our wet living bogs are crucial weapons in our efforts to avoid climate catastrophe.

The plan to restore the 1,800 ha of protected raised bogs in 2020 was referred to in connection with an additional budget allocation of &euro;5 million.  How much carbon is envisaged being stored over that five-year period?  Does the Department use any other agencies to support its planting or the work it does on rehabilitation, restoration or whatever is required?  Do any other State agencies tender for that work and, if so, do they get it?  I am thinking in particular of Bord na M&oacute;na and the potential for it to maintain its workforce through retraining and accessing the tender.

A number of companies are using their own boglands for horticulture.

The idea behind the programme is to restore 32 bogs.  We hope to begin restoring nine bogs next year.  When the 32 bogs have been restored, it will result in the storage of around 28 megatonnes of carbon.  The nine bogs earmarked for restoration next year will help maintain a store of approximately six megatonnes of carbon, which will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 5,000 tonnes.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked how the programme is managed at the moment.  There are two sides to it.  As I mentioned, we have EU LIFE programme funding.  We are getting funding from the European Commission and the Department is making a financial contribution.  This is managed by a LIFE project team that is under contract to the Department for five years.  It would go to tender for the restoration work being done in 12 special areas of conservation sites.  Dr. Renou-Wilson spoke about restoration and re-wetting.  In the raised bog sites - the designated sites - we are trying to maintain the active raised bog and restore degraded to active.  This would largely involve drain blocking with peat or plastic dams.  When the project team for the LIFE project goes out for that work, it tenders for that work.  It might tender for a block of bogs together, perhaps in a particular area.  Bogs are mainly found in the midlands and east Galway.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, separate from the LIFE project, the Department is moving ahead with the restoration of State-owned land in other raised bogs in special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.  A lot of engineering and surveying skills are involved in that along with the physical restoration works.  We went to tender for that project a number of years ago.  Bord na M&oacute;na project manages that project for the Department.  <\/p> <p>  I also mentioned that we are trying relocate turf cutters to non-designated bogs.  There will be a certain amount of work in terms of land purchase and infrastructure works on the non-designated sites.  Again, Bord na M&oacute;na project managed that for the Department as a result of a tender process.  If it is useful to the committee, I can go into more detail about the restoration work that has already been undertaken but perhaps for now, it would be better to hand over to Dr. Renou-Wilson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Lucas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I would like to correct a comment about the budget because the 28 million tonnes of carbon were not for the 1,800 ha.  That equates to the high bog - the uncut bog - which covers 16,000 ha.<\/p> <p>  The next question concerned how long it takes to re-wet.  It is magical.  If one wets a basket of peat, it stops emitting immediately.  There is no trick involved and nothing else is necessary.  It could not be cheaper.  It simply involves preventing rainwater from draining away and leaving it in the bog.  If the peat is wet, it will stop emitting because that is what it has been doing for the past 10,000 years since the last Ice Age.  There is no trickery involved and no money is needed to do that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked for a good example of paludiculture.  There are several examples.  It depends on location.  Even though we are a small island, location is important because it depends on how wet the climate is.  The west of Mayo is much wetter than the midlands.  It will also depend on how wet and cold winters are.  Countries like Canada, Germany and Finland have been trying everything that grows.<\/p><p>If it grows well in a given climate, it should be used.  In Ireland, reeds, including cattails and phragmites, grow well and could have good biomass to burn, as well as trees.<br\/><br\/>The other question related to the announcement about Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte planting bogs.  I was involved in such a project 20 years ago and, therefore, I know all about planting trees on bogs.  It is not easy and it causes many other environmental issues.  I was wary when I heard the announcement.  I hope both organisations will learn from what we have learned.  Some 250 ha of peat has been afforested in the midlands and one hopes they will return to that.  We need to be careful because if the peat is not rewetted and the trees do not grow satisfactorily, carbon will be emitted constantly from the dried peat.  Nevertheless, there are areas, especially in the midlands, that, perhaps due to their location in the topography, such as in a sloping area or a raised position, have been cut all around.  There is no way they could be rewet before everything else is rewet.  In such areas, a way will have to be found to sequester at least some carbon through afforestation, but we must assess every area for re-wetting potential before we do that rather than just deciding on what is easiest for everyone, which has been the <i>modus operandi<\/i>thus far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Florence Renou-Wilson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>To clarify, certain trees are suitable for rewetting bogs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#H00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Florence Renou-Wilson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>It is an idea that could work if the correct bogs are selected and rewetted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#H00400","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>And the correct species of trees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Florence Renou-Wilson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Yes, to match.

Given the importance of restoring the peatlands, has the Department set out a verifiable pathway for the rehabilitation recommended by the committee?  There is a division between Departments and I realise civil servants cannot do much about this.  However, there is a problem here.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are dealing with this.  Is that causing a problem and giving rise to an unco-ordinated approach?<\/p> <p>  I also have a couple of questions for Dr. Renou-Wilson regarding the uses for cutaway bog in terms of biomass on the cutaway section on the edges.  It is hard to grow anything on top of a raised bog.  I have not seen many people being successful with that.  The only things that grow on it are heather and sphagnum.  We have to get them growing again when the bogs are rewetted to regenerate them and keep them as growing bogs.  That is why they are raised in the first place.  As regards the cutaway areas where all the peat has been extracted on the edges, there is a large amount of that in Laois, Offaly and other midland counties.  In terms of growing biomass, what is most suitable there?  Willow has been tried and I understand it has not been successful.  She mentioned wet crops.  There are three power stations located in areas where there is large amount of bog.  They were located there for that reason.  Is there an opportunity to grow biomass there to fire those power stations?  In terms of trees on cutaway bogs, if willow did not work, what is the potential for small trees?  Silver birch is growing really well on the cutaway bogs.  It is growing naturally all over the place.  Is there potential to use silver birch or small fast-growing, broadleaf trees for biomass?<\/p> <p>  On the nationally designated NHAs and the SACs, will Mr. Lucas outline the difference between those?  Will he provide a synopsis of what is proposed for each of them and which ones are being given priority in terms of rehabilitation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#J01800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The national restoration programme for raised bogs is for both the SACs and the NHAs.  As stated earlier, we have 53 raised bog SACs and 75 raised bog NHAs.  There is a proposal to reconfigure the NHA network arising from a 2014 review.  The Bill to give effect to that, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, is going through the Oireachtas at present.  The proposal is that we would keep 36 of the current raised bog NHAs, including parts of seven sites, and there is provision for the de-designation of 46 NHAs, including parts of seven sites.  These are ones which have little or no restoration potential.  It is also proposed to propose 25 new sites for designation as NHAs.  The restoration programme is for both the raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked what the difference is.  The main difference is that the special areas of conservation are designated under the habitats directive, which is transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, whereas the natural heritage areas are designated under national law, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.<\/p><p>However, both designations are part of the national conservation target area for raised bog that has been set.  The NHA has contributed to that target.  Even though they are designated under national law, they are part of Ireland's overall target to maintain or restore raised bogs.  As I said, the framing for this has been set out in the national raised bog special areas of conservation management plan, published in December 2017.  The name causes a bit of confusion but it covers the NHAs as well as the SACs.  Previously, until the budget announcement of &euro;5 million, the intention had been to restore all the designated raised bog sites within three cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the management plan.  Now that we have the extra funding in the budget, we will see if we can accelerate that programme's timeframe.  I have already gone through the programme and where the funding will go.  I will not go into the detail of this but, as I said, we are already providing funding.  We started with the living bog project, which is a &euro;5.4 million EU LIFE project, to which the Department is contributing &euro;1.352 million plus the restoration work on State-owned lands.  As far as the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service are concerned, bog restoration has been ongoing for a long time but we did a major study on Ireland's raised bog resource in 2013.  From that we have developed a new restoration programme.  We have restoration plans for all the raised bog special areas of conservation.  We are also developing those plans for the raised bog NHAs.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley also asked about co-ordination between Departments.  When I listed the Departments and agencies on the peatlands strategy implementation group earlier, I missed one or two of them.  I was speaking from memory.  As well as those I mentioned, we have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Office of Public Works, the Environmental Protection Agency, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.  In the past year, since the publication of the Government's climate action plan in June, I have found there has been a focus in what the Department is doing on raised bog restoration.  This links into the peatlands action in the climate action plan.  There is a comprehensive structure in place in reporting that.  So far, in my experience, it has worked very well and it has helped co-ordination.  In the Department we report to the climate action delivery board, which, as far as I know, is chaired by the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach, and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We report on our progress and the restoration programme to the climate action delivery board.  Our Secretary General is represented on the board and, as I said, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is on it as well.  That system is working very well.  The focus of our Department is on the designated sites.  As I said, we have 53 raised bog SACs and 75 raised bog NHAs, and the restoration of those, as well as addressing the needs of turf cutters, is a big programme of work for us.<\/p><p> I am not too sure if I missed anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#J01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Lucas","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571785200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Deputy Hildegarde Naughton resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>We will have to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#K00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I asked Dr. Renou-Wilson a question about crops on cutaway bog that are suitable for biomass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#K00400","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Renou-Wilson to be brief if she can.

The opportunity to do that is considerable.  In fact, we have a huge wealth of experience in that.  Unfortunately, this was all funded by Bord na M&oacute;na, which has all the reports.  I have been working with Bord na M&oacute;na for the past 20 years on how to grow anything on peat.  We have tried everything.  The Deputy mentioned silver birch.  Silver birch grows naturally on cutover bog because it is dry.  As the Deputy said, as soon as peat is wetted, the birch will look very sad, unfortunately.  One could plant other species such as alder, which grows much better in wet soil without releasing carbon from the peat.  What I am trying to say is that a comprehensive amount of work has already been done and considerable experience has been gained.  Bord na M&oacute;na thought at the time that this was not economically viable, but now there is the issue of climate change.  At the time, 20 years ago, nobody talked about the carbon, but now, with climate change in mind, we could see many potential options.  We should be supported at the beginning in order that we can at least get farmers revenue from these areas.

If we were to give Mr. Lucas 100 assistants and colleagues, make budget a non-issue and provide every resource possible to rewet, rewild and rehabilitate, how many of those 11 tonnes of emissions could be removed from the equation by the end of the next decade?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#K02700","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The simple answer is \"quite a lot\".  I do not know exactly how much, but a lot of that emissions total comes from the burning of peat and horticulture peat.  We could easily move that use to zero.  I am not talking just about domestic turf.  We do not know how much domestic turf cutting there is in Ireland and what are the associated emissions.  We have a vague estimate, but it could be reduced directly.  What Deputy Eamon Ryan is talking about really is the drained peat source and whether we can stop those peat soils emitting carbon.  If we put in a real effort, we can do so.  It is not rocket science.  We have the experience and expertise and can do it.  Not all of that will be visible because we are into issues relating to managing the water table.  It takes a great deal of engineering and work to manage the water table.  One cannot just walk away and switch off pumps.  That is not managing the water table.

I thank Mr. Lucas and Dr. Renou-Wilson for their presentations.  Dr. Renou-Wilson spoke about 16,000 ha that make up the 53 special areas of conservation that together would store 28 million tonnes of carbon.  Mr. Lucas spoke about 1,800 ha being worked on in 2020 and 28,000 tonnes of carbon.  I agree it is crucial to move to the wider issue of our peatlands strategy.  If we properly resourced and scaled up our interventions, simply looking at only raised bog areas, we could potentially look at 28 million tonnes of storage versus 28,000 tonnes of storage.  It is quite a difference.<\/p> <p>  I apologise but I will focus on protected areas because I am concerned that they may not continue to be protected areas.  It was interesting to hear the specific numbers indicated by Mr. Lucas.  The intention is to dedesignate 46 of the currently recognised natural heritage areas.  Am I correct in saying that 46 of the raised bog natural heritage areas, which are currently recognised as areas of natural heritage, are a tiny fraction of the peatland in this country with national protected status?  Is it correct to say that 46 of 75, or more than half, are due for dedesignation under the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016?  I raise this because Mr. Lucas raised the issue of the legislation.  I suggested it may have been appropriate to wait to deal with that Bill until these hearings were completed, but this relates to policy.<\/p> <p>  Is it not the case that even a simple re-wetting of all the current natural heritage areas would have a benefit in terms of carbon sequestration nationally?  I am talking about the 46 affected by the proposal for dedesignation.  Would it be better to re-wet them and keep that network in play, regardless of whether we add new natural heritage areas?  I refer to the process around this.  Leaving aside any amendments - it is not what we will discuss today, although I agree with others in the Houses who saw them as troubling - we can look at the Government proposal, which is that the conservation value of a raised bog takes into account a comparison made between the area, range, habitat structure, function and ecological features of the bog and those of one or more other raised bogs.  My specific concern is the way the Department will decide which bogs are to be dedesignated and where protection will be removed.  It is through comparison with others, so what will they be compared with?  Will they be compared with the full network of natural heritage areas or special area of conservation bogs?  Will they be compared with the 12 bogs focused on this year?  Will they be used as a tool to justify the dedesignation of other natural heritage areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#M01800","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I raised the matter of the natural heritage area network because I was asked a question by a Deputy.

The most comprehensive analysis ever done was completed of Ireland's raised bog resource, considering the 52 raised bog special areas of conservation, the 75 natural heritage areas, and 100 non-designated sites.

The review concluded, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, that there should be a refigured network that would involve the cessation of turf cutting in 36 NHAs, which would remain designated.  Those who have had to cease domestic turf cutting on those sites have been provided with compensation by the Department since that time.  As stated, seven sites were to be divided with one part to be conserved and another part to be designated.  The de-designation of the 46 sites includes the parts of the seven sites to be preserved.  They are sites that have been judged on the basis that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal or restoration is considered to be prohibitively expensive relative to the conservation benefits it would achieve.

In response to my colleague, who asked about the SACs, Mr. Lucas was very clear because this Bill also allows for a similar bog versus bog comparator regarding the de-designation of blanket bogs.  Mr. Lucas outlined a very lengthy process in respect of raised bogs.  There has been no equivalent process for blanket bogs.  Mr. Lucas said that the Department would not want to look for any system of management.  In fact, it does not even want to move ahead with the management of SACs blanket bogs, which is mandatorily required by the habitats directive, without consultation and directives.  However, it is proposing a mechanism that can allow for the de-designation of blanket bogs in advance of having had such a consultation so it seems that it is ready to run ahead on the legislation in terms of natural heritage area blanket bogs even though it has not delivered on its requirements in terms of special area of conservation blanket bogs.  I note that it is not in the gift of the Department to de-designate SACs so it probably cannot be claimed as a virtue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#N01000","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Does the Senator have another question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#N01100","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>My final question was addressed to Dr. Renou-Wilson.

Farmers with that type of ground got grants from the Government to drain said land.  This was to help them to derive a living from the land they were given or they bought.  That is all what they had to put food on the table.  They got grants and were advised by bodies such as ACOT and Teagasc to drain their land to keep more stock.  Now, people are saying they cannot keep their cattle and must drown these lands because they are a big problem and to go to hell after that.  That is not fair.<\/p> <p>  I note the deliberate action of raising the water table.  People worked hard to lower the water table to dry their lands.  To be told all of a sudden that they must change their tactics, block drains, flood the land, have ducks and wild birds and not to keep their animals is absolutely ridiculous.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are, by and large, referring to the midlands.  We know what happened in the budget.  I do not regret the people in the midlands getting money to compensate them for being unable to work in Bord na M&oacute;na.  However, the fact is that the people in rural Ireland who must have a car, tractor and a lorry will pay the carbon tax to foot the Government&rsquo;s decision to close these bogs that are creating energy.  The policy is all electric.  However, in the finish, if we close down all the power stations, where are we going to get the electricity?  I do not think anybody has answered that question.<\/p> <p>  I live in and represent Kerry.  People from the midlands have been on to me, however, about Bord na M&oacute;na blocking drains and stopping pumping water from the bogs.

If the water from these State-owned lands cannot reach the main drainage course, it will create difficulties for people around those places.<\/p> <p>  There is a big question as to the legality of what is proposed.

That is not what the habitats directive was about.<\/p> <p>  It is not helpful when the likes of the NPWS are trying to resolve issues on the 53 raised bog SACs.<\/p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Services, NPWS, has called them the best bogs in the country.  When one has a bog that is functioning and has been rewetted, and the active raised bog is beginning to work back again, what is the carbon sequestration per acre on that bog?  What is the tonnage per year, per acre?  I have been at a conference, but I would like to know the position on a raised bog.  I know that blanket bog is totally different.  Blanket bog regenerates itself much more quickly than the raised bog.<\/p><p> The other point made by Dr. Renou-Wilson was that she said that if one cuts on the outside of the bog, that the middle of it is destroyed.  I have been with Ray Flynn from Queen's University Belfast, who I am sure Dr. Renou-Wilson knows well, and with RPS and have been on complexes of 3,000 acres.  They can prove that maybe for 200 m or 250 m, such a cutting would have an effect, but the bog will remain intact inside of that.  One has to be able to show, under the habitats directive, that one does not have an adverse effect, which is the wording of the directive.  Dr. Renou-Wilson's statement earlier that the middle of the bog would get degraded is not correct.<\/p><p> As to the ongoing de-designating bogs debacle, there are category 1 and 2 bogs, degraded bogs, and ones that were not worthwhile regenerating.  When the scientists such as RPS went out and studied this - people do not want to look into this - it was completely useless to try to put these bogs back.  Consequently, it decided to go around the country to look for other bogs that would help it in its overall plan of reaching the required targets.  It reached these numbers, in order to make the new plan, which was a sensible thing to do, rather than at Raheenmore Bog - our witnesses may be familiar with this bog - which was taken over and given to the National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1979 by Bord na M&oacute;na.  Liners were put into it that blew out of the way.  Efforts were being made to restore the bog.  To this day, this is a bog that it is virtually impossible to regenerate or to have re-function.  This can be compared with bogs where I am from in the west of Ireland and where people cut domestic turf in which the base of the bog is still there and will always be there; it is like biting at the toes of an elephant.  Those bogs are able to regenerate, can be rewetted and one can work with them so much better.  <\/p><p> I listened earlier where the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, was getting stick in respect of this 28 million tonnes, or 11 billion or whatever was the figure.  In fairness, I cannot say that I am going to go into anyone's house and say that I am taking it over, no more than I can say that I am going to go into a person's private property in a bog.  The NPWS cannot do that.  On top of that, it has rewetted some bogs and will have difficulty for the simple reason that there are private landowners with whom it would not be familiar because there are turbary and fee simple rights.  In fact, there are eight different types of rights involved with bogs.  Those people will shove their heads above the parapet shortly and they can ask for their drains to be reopened where rewetting was done because the NPWS went in on private property.  Either we are going to be communists in this country and are going to take over the world or we are we going to sit down, talk, and work with people in a proper fashion.  <\/p><p> I seek an answer to those questions about the sequestration in respect of what the NPWS call those charm bogs in the 53 raised bogs SACs, that is, the tonnage of sequestration.  Mr. Lucas has had people dealing with an issue in the past few years with the regeneration of bogs whereby a machine has to be brought in on it with low ground pressure.  Is the estimate of &euro;5 million equal to about 17 diggers for 240 days, which is 17 people for the same period?  Is that a fair assessment what Mr. Lucas's Department has done has done so far around the country?  We have seen the Bord na M&oacute;na side of this, which would be a more intensive approach to regenerate a bog because the bogs the NPWS are working in have vegetation and very little drainage on them in comparison, because the drainage done would have been done at the time of the council work.  Domestic turf cutters do not need drainage on a bog to cut it, which we need to be clear about.  I am aware that the Department is going to some bogs at the moment, Carrowbehy Bog, for example.  That is the work that &euro;5 million does on bogs that are fairly intact.  If one looks at the Bord na M&oacute;na bogs, as was pointed out earlier, there are drains every 12 m, this work would be much more intense for the machines.  Would Mr. Lucas consider that there will be less work will get done because of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019102300002#O01600","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Can we have short answers, please, even though there are many questions there?

Peatlands have two functions when it comes to carbon.  It stores the carbon that is already in there, which is the biggest issue at the moment.  This is the carbon that has taken thousands of years to accumulate in the peat.  Peat is roughly 50 kg of carbon per cu. m.

We cannot get away from that fact.  At the end of the petition, the petitioner states \"This is from a millennial worried about my prospects in the housing market in the future other than renting\".  It is worth noting that for the first time in the history of the State, we have fallen behind the EU average rate of homeownership of 69%.  We are behind Germany, which is supposed to have the model that pursues renting as the option, in home ownership rates.  Less than 20 years ago, the average age at which a person could buy his or her own home was in his or her 20s.  I was approximately 25 when I bought the home I live in now.  It is now in a person's mid-30s when he or she can buy.<\/p> <p>  The petitioner has touched on a major issue in respect of properties.  It is a matter the Committee of Public Accounts touched on when the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was before us to discuss large developments being bought up by investment funds while squeezing potential first-time buyers out of the market.  In that context, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) (First-Time Buyers) Bill 2019 in the D&aacute;il yesterday through Deputy Darragh O'Brien to allow local authorities to designate up to 30% of zoned land for first-time buyers.  Initiatives like that to tackle this issue in the context of what the petitioner has said are worthy of consideration.  I would not pursue the method the petitioner proposes, but investment companies buying up these properties is fundamentally wrong.  It is a slight against the country.  Those of all political hues can agree when investment companies are squeezing first-time buyers.  Looking at the statistics, home ownership figures are falling behind those in countries with a supposed rental model.  That is worrying for this country.

Not everybody wants to own a house.  We have some kind of psychological block in Ireland that one has to own a house.  It is all about having security and a home.  Under the Austrian model, however, people can live in massive communal villages where no one is under pressure.  It does not matter how much a person earns a month, there is a standard rate.

I was disappointed, and nearly angry, to see these amendments ruled out of order.  The Bill is about the rights and interests of a child, which is why the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, GAL, system was put in place in the first instance.  This is particularly the case at the moment, where social workers change regularly and many children do not have social workers for long periods.  In many cases, the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is basically the child's right-hand person.  If we are saying that we will not allow for guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>in all circumstances, the Bill is hypocritical.<\/p><p>I have a major issue with the fact that it was 6.30 p.m. yesterday when we were told that the amendments had been ruled out of order.  That is very short notice to allow us to prepare for today.  The ruling undermines the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to provide for a discussion on the matter so that we might find a way of getting around it.  Amendment No. 2 in particular is important, but it has been ruled out of order.  I would like to see us doing something about the matter it addresses and amending the Bill on Report Stage.  Otherwise, we in my party will be reserving the right to vote against the Bill on Report Stage.  It is contradictory and hypocritical and does not protect the best interests of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#B00300","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I will echo what my colleagues have said.  It is unusual for three Opposition Deputies to work together and submit amendments.  We obviously felt strongly on this issue, given that we submitted three joint amendments.  We did so because we believed we would be facilitating, supporting and strengthening the Bill.  Ruling them out of order will leave the Bill weak, and the people who will be most affected are the children in the childcare system.  I ask that the Minister consider what we have submitted.  Deputy Funchion cited one amendment in particular, but what we speak about in our amendments goes to the core of the issue, namely, ensuring that every child has access to a GAL regardless of postcode lotteries or the level of the court system he or she is in.  The child might not need a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, but he or she would have had the opportunity to decline one.  Another amendment would have protected the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>by providing him or her access to legal advice.<\/p><p>That is where we were coming from with our amendments.

Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in every case before the District Court would entail a significant increase in the cost to the State.  Amendment No. 3 is consequential to amendment No. 1.  The amendments must therefore be ruled out of order as they would create a charge on the revenue, in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).  That is the advice that has been given.

I thank the Chair for sharing that advice.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because I do not agree that the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem <\/i>should mandatory in every case.  That opinion is shared by many stakeholders who have engaged with us, including Dr. Carol Coulter, who as the Deputy knows is the director of the Child Care Law Reporting Project.  I have also discussed this with my officials at length.  To tease out why that would be the case I will propose some hypothetical situations in which it might not always be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.  <\/i>One example would be a non-contentious case where a child is already in care, either with relatives or in general foster care, and where this is being formalised by a care order.  Another example might be the case of a vulnerable parent, in which voluntary care may not be appropriate.  The proceedings may be about formalising care by relatives.  That is an example in which it might not be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Another example might concern an older child, who might not want yet another professional to be assigned to him or her.  An older child may request to speak to the judge directly, perhaps accompanied by his or her social worker.  Those are examples where in my opinion it may not be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.  <\/i>Therefore the Bill should not stipulate that it is mandatory to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Of course guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>do very valuable work, but in many cases it is important to provide flexibility.  We must recognise that they are not the only way for a child to have his or her views and best interests represented in every set of circumstances.  I expect the Deputies would agree with that.<\/p><p>The provisions relating to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem <\/i>must be read in conjunction with the additional obligations the Bill places on the court through the greatly expanded section 24, with which I know Deputies are familiar.  That new section removes the reference to parents' rights and responsibilities and clearly states, &quot;the court shall regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration in the resolution of any such proceedings&quot;.  It includes a long list of factors that the court must consider when determining what is in the best interests of the child.  It also inserts a new section 24A, which provides:<\/p><blockquote>... the court, in so far as practicable shall&mdash;(a) determine the means by which to facilitate the expression by the child of his or her views in the proceedings, and<br \/><br \/>(b) give such views as the child wishes to express due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/blockquote> <p>Taken together, these provisions place a heavy duty on the court to hear the views of children who are the subject of care proceedings, to give those views due weight and to fully consider a long list of factors during its consideration of what is in the child's best interests.<\/p><p>The judge in childcare proceedings has an overarching responsibility to vindicate the rights of the child, including his or her fair procedure rights.  The authors of Child Care Proceedings: A Thematic Review of Irish and International Practice, research commissioned by my Department, outlined other mechanisms used in other jurisdictions to hear the views of the child.  Those include a meeting between the child and the judge, the child providing the court with a personal letter, video or drawing, the child responding to a questionnaire and the child communicating his or her views through his or her social worker.<\/p><p>I do not want to constrain the courts if they have a better way of doing something for a particular child.  I am also mindful of the planned reform of the family courts and hope that in the future there may be other approaches to hearing a child's view more directly and representing his or her best interests.  Amendments including the one proposed by Deputy Rabbitte acknowledge that a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is not always needed.  The amendment suggests that when a child does not want one to be appointed to him or her, the child's views should be respected.  My provision provides that when considering whether to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem, <\/i>the court should consider the views of the child on whether or not he or she should have one.  Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to every single child, even children who have already expressed the view that they do not want one, forces a child to reject a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>once one is appointed.<\/p><p>That would be disrespectful to an articulate young person who has already made his or her views known to the court.  I feel it would make more sense not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>if a child does not want one in the first instance.  That is in the Bill as it stands.  I also believe that adding an extra layer to proceedings by requiring a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to be appointed and then dismissed, because he or she is not needed, would undo a lot of the good work we are trying to do.  We want a new guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system to reduce complications and delays and not add to them.  The Bill is an effort to bring about a recalibration of our statutory landscape in which the child is placed front and centre.  I know members agree with that principle, even if they have different views on this particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#C03800","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Members can come in on the section but we cannot debate amendments that have been ruled out of order.

It is important to emphasise that, as matters stand, a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, GAL, is not a party, and has never been a party.

That is an important distinction but it emphasises that discretion resides with the court to allow the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to work for the child&rsquo;s best interests.  It is important to acknowledge the overarching responsibility of the judge in the case is to vindicate the rights of the child and to behave proportionately in the interests of the child, and that there is no fundamental impediment to vindication of the fair procedure rights of the child in an arrangement where the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is not a party to the proceedings.<\/p><p>This provision does not remove this discretion but we want to make it clear that, effectively, there is no automatic right for the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to act as a party.  This Bill sets out a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>role that is based on the Children&rsquo;s Acts Advisory Board 2009 guidance.  Its core functions are to ascertain the views of the child and to make recommendations to the court on what is in the best interests of the child.  Party status does not sit well with this role as an independent resource appointed to ascertain the views of the child and make recommendations to the court.  I would like to emphasise that the child can be made a party under the Child Care Act, as it stands, and, under this Bill, a child who is a party can also have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.

In one case, a solicitor of long standing who is operating in Cork, Mr. Colm Roberts, is on the public record as part of process of interrogating and examining the role of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  He stated in a recent presentation:<\/p><blockquote>In 2009 I raised my concern in another child care case before the District Court in Cork as I believed that as a legal advisor for parents, I was at a disadvantage in cases where the extent and role of the Gal was unclear, and particularly the extent and role of his\/her legal representation was even more unsettling as it seemed to move the Gal into a more adversarial role.<br \/><br \/>This particularly became more acute in circumstances where the Gal was supporting the application for Care Orders by the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency (previously HSE).  This is very problematic for the Court to balance the right of the Gal to fully participate in proceedings that he\/she has been appointed in and at the same time ensure that natural justice and fairness to all parties is protected and vindicated.  This issue was dealt with in detail [in] a judgment by District judge Mitchell.<\/blockquote> <p>In putting forward the amendment to delete, we want to strike a balance between the presumption in favour of the appointment of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>and the discretion of the District Court in the absence of a fully fledged family courts infrastructure, while seeking to give a voice to the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, which is the voice of the child before the court.  I do not see what is so injurious about our intention to delete these lines.  I am not a lawyer and I have never been a witness before a court, in particular proceedings before the family courts, so I am a layman in this respect.  We are seeking to ensure that voice is absolutely robust in the absence of there being a fully fledged family courts infrastructure.  Again, this goes back to the geographical disparities that exist between certain parties where, without being disrespectful to District Court judges, not every District Court judge has the training in respect of these types of cases that come before them.  Is there a formula of words that would copperfasten the importance of the role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>without necessarily calling for them not to be a party?

There is a lamentable absence of comprehensive, quantifiable data about childcare proceedings in Ireland.  The childcare law reporting project's valuable work has provided a window into those proceedings but we are still lacking reliable quantifiable data on childcare cases.  It is my intention that the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>office will endeavour to provide information on its activities, while respecting the important privacy protections provided by the <i>in camera<\/i>rule and GDPR.  I am happy to consider bringing forth an amendment to provide for the publication of an annual report.  I will consult the Attorney General's office on the appropriate wording.  <\/p><p>I take this opportunity to advise Deputies that I also intend to bring forward two amendments on Report Stage to the <i>in camera<\/i>rule under section 29 of the Child Care Act.  As I have mentioned, the childcare law reporting project provides a valuable window into these proceedings, but there is currently no expressed basis for Department officials to attend proceedings.  This creates difficulties for the Department in terms of monitoring the implementation of the 1991 Act and the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>executive office into the future.  While I recognise the importance of the <i>in camera<\/i>rule for the protection of the privacy of children and their families, I am also conscious of the seriousness of State intervention in family life under the 1991 Act and the obligation for legislation and policy to be informed by evidence from our courts.  I have secured Government approval for an amendment to section 29 of the 1991 Act to authorise the attendance of two specific groups of officials, including those who will have official responsibility for managing guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and those who will have a specific role in monitoring the implementation of the 1991 in order to revise and improve it.  <\/p><p>The second proposed amendment will enable the childcare law reporting project and other similar bodies to exercise their functions properly by ensuring that they have access to all relevant reports.  I emphasise that these proposed amendments will not impact on the court's ability to restrict access to the court on a case-by-case basis but nor will they impact on the court's ability to restrict access to court documents, if desired, in the specific circumstances of a particular case.  Furthermore, no person will be permitted to make public information likely to lead members of the public to identify either a party to the proceedings or a child to whom proceedings relate.  Additionally, I am considering the possibility of introducing a provision which would allow for a review of the reformed guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>arrangements under this Bill.  I have instructed my officials to explore this issue with parliamentary counsel.  The intention is that such a review would commence not later than three years following the coming into operation of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#M01200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>My first instinct in regard to what the Minister is proposing to introduce on Report Stage in regard to having her officials attend at family courts is to be concerned about it.

I was genuinely disappointed that amendment No. 2, which went to the heart of the Bill, was ruled out of order.  It spoke to the reason the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system exists in the first instance.  I understand and accept the point the Minister has made about a child who might not want to have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>or about straightforward cases in which there is no need for a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  We allowed for that in amendment No. 2, which stated: &quot;The District Court may discharge an order directing the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, on the application of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, if the child so requests.&quot;  We understand that the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is not necessary in certain cases.  In other cases, the child does not want a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to be appointed.  We think it would be better to say from the start to every child in care that he or she has a right and an entitlement to a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  If we are genuinely interested in representing children, being the voice of children and ensuring the interests and rights of children are heard, listened to and respected, this is the crux of the matter.  I find it very difficult to support this legislation without this amendment being factored into it.  That is why I asked earlier if there is any way of looking at this issue in advance of Report Stage.  I would appreciate it if such a way could be found.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  If we cannot find a compromise or a solution in this respect, I will vote against the Bill on Report Stage and I will advise my party colleagues to do likewise.  It is hypocritical to state that we want this system to be in place to ensure children in care are protected, while at the same time saying that not every child in care will get a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  It is definite that children will fall through the cracks.  In years to come, cases will be taken against the State by people who feel they should have been given a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>but no such opportunity was provided to them.  While I understand what has been said about the cost to the Exchequer, the issue goes beyond that.  I found it difficult to go through the rest of the Bill after this amendment was ruled out of order.  This aspect of it is the heart of the matter for me.  I will wait to see whether it is rectified in advance of Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#N02800","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her time.  As stated earlier when she was not present, there is a great deal of good in the Bill.  We have focused on one section of the Bill in our amendments.  It is important to acknowledge that there is a lot of good stuff in the Bill.  Most of the amendments that have been proposed relate to section 6.  I have met officials from her Department.  I would welcome another meeting if that could be facilitated.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock, who said that this is about the language.  I firmly believe there is a wording that could be used.

I am a purist when it comes to my belief that every child should have the opportunity to avail of the services of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>if those services are needed or if he or she chooses to avail of those services.  We have discussed children who do not want to have the opportunity to avail of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.

We all sit here and say a social worker can do this.  A social worker cannot, and I speak from experience regarding the service of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Sometimes children are sick to their back teeth of talking to officials, and they see social workers as officials.

I am here in my capacity as a research officer at the ESRI.  I am an economist by training and I am a PhD in the area of in the area of health economics.  I am the lead author of the ESRI working paper, An Examination of Activity in Public and Private Hospitals in Ireland 2015, which was published last October and which the Joint Committee on Health has invited me to discuss.  The analysis was undertaken as part of the ESRI-Department of Health research programme in healthcare reform, which has the broader objective of projecting demand for and expenditure on healthcare services in Ireland.  The working paper was prepared in light of the independent review group's work examining the implications of the Sl&aacute;intecare proposal to remove private practice from public hospitals.<\/p> <p>  While the ESRI did not provide any direct input to the deliberations of the review group, the working paper was subsequently cited as part of the review group's final published report in August 2019.  The ESRI working paper examines the extent of private activity in public hospitals and provides an overview of service delivery across public and private hospitals in Ireland in 2015.  The analysis expands on research undertaken and findings presented as part of the ESRI research series report, Projections of Demand for Health Care in Ireland 2015-2030, the first report from the Hippocrates Model published in October 2017.  The report contained new analysis of private hospital activity, which had not been previously published for the Irish healthcare system.  The working paper expands on that analysis by examining the extent to which care in public hospitals was delivered on a public or private basis.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, nearly 1.5 million day patients, those admitted and discharged on the same day for elective, that is, scheduled treatment, and nearly 4.2 million inpatient bed days relating to either elective or emergency care were recorded across the public and private hospital system in Ireland.  The public hospital system delivered the majority of this care.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, approximately seven out of ten day patient cases, and more than eight out of 10 inpatient bed days were estimated to have taken place in public hospitals.  Some 16% of cases in public hospitals were treated privately.<\/p> <p>  Looking at private care across the hospital system, more than 75% of all private day patient activity was recorded in private hospitals.  In contrast, we estimate that less than half of all private inpatient bed days were recorded in private hospitals.  These findings suggest that the private hospital system is primarily specialised in the delivery of elective care, with all day patient care being elective by definition.<\/p> <p>  In considering the removal of private care from public hospitals, it is important to note that most private inpatient activity in public hospitals are emergency inpatients arriving through hospital emergency departments.  Elective private inpatient activity accounts for less than 4% of total inpatient bed days in public hospitals in 2015.<\/p> <p>  It is unclear, therefore, whether the types of private emergency inpatients currently treated in public hospitals could access the care they require in private hospitals.  Traditionally private hospitals have not provided many of the more urgent and complex treatments associated with emergency care that are available in public hospitals.  Data on public and private activity in public hospitals were available from the hospital inpatient enquiry, HIPE, scheme managed by the healthcare pricing office.  HIPE collects detailed clinical and administrative data on discharges from and deaths in acute public hospitals nationally.  However, we did not have access to comparable routinely collected administrative data on private hospital activity.<\/p> <p>  To try to fill this gap, private hospital activity profiles were estimated using aggregate information on health insurance claims provided by the health insurance market regulator, the Health Insurance Authority.  We would have liked to extend this analysis further, for example, to compare public and private activity at the level of diagnoses and procedures or to compare the roles of the two types of hospitals with respect to elect and emergency inpatient care.  Data limitations meant this depth of analysis was not possible.  The absence of good quality data creates difficulty for both researchers and policy makers to inform important policy proposals, such as the one being discussed this morning, with evidence.<\/p> <p>  The full working paper has been circulated to the committee and is available on the ESRI website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Dr. Keegan.

There is cross-party political support for this for a very good reason: quite simply, access to public acute hospital services is unfair and that needs to change.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is unusual in that those with private health insurance or who can pay out of pocket are able to access services in public hospitals quicker than those who do not have health insurance or cannot afford to pay.  This is not fair.  It is difficult to think of any other public service where people are treated more favourably simply because they can pay more for a service.  Our recommendations are designed to eliminate this unfairness.  Our proposal would also help to move us towards the accepted norm in almost all advanced countries.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of private practice in public hospitals is very unusual.  We asked the OECD to report for us on the Irish system, and it found Ireland to be a striking outlier.  We have a very large private health insurance market.  The overwhelming number of hospital consultants have rights to private work and almost 30% of our total hospital activity is funded privately, a situation comparable only to the US.<\/p> <p>  I would like to refer briefly to the widespread misunderstanding about the cost of removing private care.  The recommendations we make are costed, and costs are phased in a way that makes the change affordable, and I will come back to this point.<\/p> <p>  We recommend legislation to ensure that public hospitals are used exclusively for the treatment of public patients from the conclusion of the ten-year Sl&aacute;intecare implementation period.  Our other recommendations ensure a reduction in private activity over time, but over the lifetime of Sl&aacute;intecare, private activity must eventually cease entirely and the legislation should provide this.<\/p> <p>  The key recommendations in the report concern the consultant contract and there are five recommendations.  First, all new consultant appointments should be to a Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract.  This would allow consultants to conduct only public activity in public hospitals.  It is important that this recommendation is implemented soon.  There is no point in continuing to issue contracts with private practice rights when these will have to be bought out in the future.  This recommendation is the key to removing private activity from public hospitals in a progressive, orderly and incremental way.<\/p><p> Second, we recognise that there are significant consultant recruitment problems in our public hospitals, with approximately 370 vacancies at the moment and a further 380 posts occupied by non-permanent staff.  While working conditions, hospital rosters and matters such as training opportunities for non-consultant doctors play an important role, pay is also a factor.  In October 2012, the starting pay of consultant doctors was cut significantly.  We recommend that the payscales for all new entrant consultants to the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract and for existing consultants appointed since 2012 on public-only contracts are restored to the scale that existed pre-October 2013.  In current terms, the starting salary of a type B consultant appointed today is &euro;131,000.  The starting salary of a new consultant should our recommendation be accepted would be &euro;182,000, a very considerable differential of &euro;51,000.  This new salary would compare very favourably with salaries in other countries and would put Irish consultants among the highest paid consultants anywhere.<\/p><p> Third, while our recommendation about new consultants being appointed to a public-only contract will ultimately lead to the removal of private activity from our hospitals, this will take some time.  In order to speed up the process and encourage existing consultants to change to the new contract arrangements, we have recommended that existing consultants should be offered a contract change payment to move to the new Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract.<\/p><p> Fourth, we are concerned that there are some consultant posts, and I stress the numbers are likely to be very small, where it may prove almost impossible to recruit a suitable candidate.  A scheme exists in the third level sector that allows a special derogation from pay service caps to address recruitment to highly specialised posts in a very limited number of cases, and we have suggested that this also needs to be considered in the public health service.<\/p><p> No doubt members are aware of some concerns that have been aired over the amount of private activity in public hospitals conducted by a small number of consultants that is above the amount allowed in their contracts.  It is our view that the HSE needs to ensure that this does not happen, so the agreed monitoring and reporting system to robustly monitor and enforce the existing consultant contract must be implemented.  We made two further recommendations, namely, the Department of Health should ensure that HIQA&rsquo;s quality and safety regulatory functions are extended to all healthcare settings, including those in the private sector, and that a better data collection system would be put in place relating to the nature and scale of activity in the private hospital system.<\/p><p> Obviously, the implementation of these recommendations gives rise to increases in public expenditure.  The additional costs arise mainly from the loss of private income of public hospitals but also in relation to consultant pay - for those taking up the public-only contract - and the increased cost of treating greater numbers of public patients, and we have set out the final costs at the end of ten years and it comes to approximately &euro;650 million per annum.  The main element of this is the private income of hospitals - now just over &euro;500 million - paid mainly by insurers.  This income is declining in any event due to the campaign by insurers to inform patients that they gain no advantage from using their insurance when admitted via the emergency department of a public hospital.  While the loss of this income will result in a cost to the Exchequer, people are already paying for this in the form of higher insurance premia, and the loss of this income will result in higher taxes but lower insurance premia.  Even if there is no change in the existing system, this source of income will decline, and it would be very risky to rely on this income continuing into the future.<\/p><p> It is important to note that &euro;650 million is the annual cost which arises after all private activity is removed.  In the initial years of implementation, the costs will actually be quite modest, primarily arising in relation to additional expenditure on consultant pay.  This would amount to around &euro;12 million if recruitment targets are met.  An additional public activity which would be caused by the recruitment of these public-only consultants would cost a maximum of &euro;40 million per annum.<\/p><p> One matter which is important to highlight is the effect these recommendations would have on the capacity of our public acute hospitals.  We believe that the vast majority of patients being treated privately in public hospitals will become public patients under our future arrangements.  This is because they are in a public hospital as emergency patients or they require complex care or multidisciplinary services, or maternity services where there is no equivalent services provided within easy reach in the private sector.<\/p><p> In our report, we also advised the Department of Health should examine the clinical indemnity scheme to ensure that there is a level playing field in relation to the clinical indemnity between private work carried out in public and private hospitals.  This would address the situation where consultants conducting private work in public hospitals currently do not have to make any contribution towards their indemnity insurance for their private work.  We have been careful to develop our recommendations in a way that ensures there is no shock to the system.  While the policy change can be commenced quickly, the effects will happen incremental over time.  While it will take ten years to fully remove private activity, significant progress can be made relatively quickly.  Also, implementing these recommendations over the lifetime of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme makes it more affordable and ensures that they happen in parallel with improved care models, better availability of diagnostics, and improvements in primary and community care that will be necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the proposal.<\/p><p> There will be little immediate effect for those who rely on private health insurance.  People will still be able to use their insurance should they wish to, but over time, our public hospital system will be better able to provide services for all public patients, and people will have less need to take out health insurance.  People will still be able to access services in private hospitals with their private health insurance should they wish.  Our recommendations represent a significant part of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme of reform and map out a small number of policy actions which can be taken which would see the change implemented progressively in parallel with the wider health service improvements already under way in Sl&aacute;intecare.  The costs are phased in a way that makes the change affordable.

One is coming in as a public patient.  If we are running a hospital, in essence all that would happen is that virtually the same number of patients would come in.

My fear is that if those consulting rooms and facilities were not available to private patients, they would be available for public patients and therefore would have an impact on the waiting lists.  <\/p> <p>  Perhaps this question is for Mr. Keegan because he outlined that while he did not have access to comparable routinely collected administrative data in private hospitals, he could collect some of it.  My difficulty is that does not give us the total cost.  We have asked the HSE repeatedly the cost to the public system of effectively subsidising private healthcare.  It is very difficult to put a money amount on it.  We previously have had people in here from the HSE who described to us what they called stretch income targets that are set for them, whereby they must collect a certain amount of money back from private health insurance.  This creates a perverse incentive.  I have never been able to see a definitive cost put on private healthcare.  We know the impacts on the waiting lists because clearly it will be public patients who will benefit from the availability of additional capacity.  On the actual cost, I refer to when a private patient is treated and where he or she skips the queue.  If two people with the same level of acuity happen to be in the accident and emergency unit - one with private health insurance and the other without - in my estimation, in all likelihood the person with private health insurance would be admitted in that instance.  If that person has already been in the accident and emergency unit, one cannot quantify the actual cost to the public system and the subsidy that is provided to the private system or am I wrong in that assumption?

If consultants are given contracts and we then want them to change to something else, they will have to be bought out.  It is a normal rule of life that if one is in a hole, one stops digging and making the problem bigger.  With the legislation and getting the newer consultants onto the Sl&aacute;intecare contract, the third piece would be getting into negotiations on the contract change payment.  We did not put a number on it because it would be a matter for negotiation or judgment.  The negotiations would try to get a reasonable number of the 3,000 consultants working under the existing arrangements onto the new ones.

We were told all along that we had too many hospital beds and we did not need them.  We were admonished at a high level for spending money on bricks and mortar because it was seen as unnecessary, and different ways were to be found to deal with patients in the future.  That did not happen.  It now appears we were misinformed by people who should have known better.  We have now moved to another scenario.  I realise that in the position we find ourselves, conditions in the workplace, insofar as our hospitals are concerned, are not ideal.  That is presumably down to overcrowding and the pressure on consultants, staff, doctors, GPs and everybody else.  Our system is not large enough to cater for the population, which  I understand.<\/p> <p>  However, how do we compete?  We have been told by the HSE that in appointing consultants, we have to compete with New York, Boston, Sydney and London, and if we do not, we will not get the staff.  The independent review group held exchanges with the various stakeholders and reference was made to consultants' pay, which was the subject of a considerable increase that will put them among the best paid in the world.  There are a couple of other issues we cannot deal with.  We cannot offer the 24 hours a day of sunshine they have to offer in Australia.  That is a decided disadvantage in attracting high-calibre people to high-calibre positions in this country.  Similarly, we cannot compete with Canada and we cannot compete with the weather conditions in many areas, including in the Middle East.  Are there issues other than consultants' pay that the independent review group considers might make that sufficient impact?  We have asked this question on a number of occasions and we have not been given an answer.  What is the total cost of that?  Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir made a stab at that in terms of the millions of euro required on an annual basis, which is hugely important.  It would probably result in a cost of approximately &euro;6 billion over a ten-year period.  We tried to get that information from some of our guests in recent weeks.  They were reluctant to tell us exactly the cost but they should be able to tell us because if there is dissatisfaction with the system as it is, it must be possible for those directly involved to identify what the problem is and to identify that it needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#K00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":717,"content":"<p>As I said in my statement, and as is stated in the report, while money is an issue, it is not the only issue.

I have no problem with that idea.  The number of outpatient appointments in public hospitals stands at approximately 3.5 million per annum.  As such, around 63,000 people attend outpatient appointments each week.  The review group's report states that 1,333 consultants have access to private rooms on site only and 600 consultants have access to rooms off-site in private hospitals and clinics.  This means nearly 2,000 of more than 3,000 consultants do some form of private practice.  Let us take a consultant employed in the public system who also sees 20 patients a week privately.

I would like to make some comments.  Most members of the joint committee sat on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, which produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The fundamental principle we were trying to introduce as part of the efforts to move private practice out of public hospitals was that preferential treatment would not be given to patients with private health insurance.  It was suggested as a strategy that there should be a common waiting list for private or public patients with no preferential treatment.  The idea was that people should be treated on the basis of need and not on the basis of whether they are insured.<\/p> <p>  When we looked at other countries, we learned that Ireland is an outlier in this regard.  In other countries where there is private health insurance, supplementary insurance gives people additional access to services but not additional access to public services.  In France, for example, one can have top-up insurance if one wishes.  It allows one to access private facilities, but it does not give one any preferential treatment in the public system.  Everybody in Ireland is essentially entitled to free public care in a public hospital, regardless of insurance status, with the caveat of paying &euro;800 a year, or &euro;80 a day for ten days.  If someone with private health insurance ends up in a public hospital, that is bonanza money for the hospital.  It is almost an accident that the person who has ended up in the public hospital has health insurance.  The perverse incentive that arises in these circumstances has been outlined.  The hospital wants to maximise the insurance income and the insurance company wants to minimise the amount of money it pays out.  In fact, it is accidental money that comes in the door of the hospital, most likely through accident and emergency admissions.<\/p> <p>  It must be impossible to police the 20% private work that is allowed in a type B contract.  If there are not many private hospitals in an area, as is the case in the mid-west, the percentage of people with private health insurance who are treated in the hospital can increase to 40%.  We cannot refuse people treatment because they have private health insurance.  We have to look after them.<\/p> <p>  If there is to be a public-only contract, medical indemnity insurance will cover public-only contract work.  My understanding is that if one has a type B contract, a proportion of one's medical indemnity insurance is not covered through the public purse.  I presume that consultants with public contracts who choose to do private work outside their 39-hour contracts will have to take out additional medical indemnity insurance to cover their private work.  At the moment, they are probably getting an advantage because their public-paid medical indemnity insurance is covering much of their private practice.<\/p> <p>  We have discussed the cost of inpatient cover.  A substantial amount of private practice takes place in our public hospitals.  Private facilities are used for diagnostics.  A consultant who carries out a private clinic in a public hospital has access to all the public facilities to carry out his diagnostic tests and his follow-up work, at no cost to the insurance company and at no cost to himself as a practitioner.  I ask Dr. Keegan and Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  We discussed the provision of elective-only hospitals in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.  As a result of capacity constraints, most people who are admitted to hospital come through accident and emergency departments.  This involves urgent work.  Elective work is being pushed out of public hospitals because they do not have the capacity to cope.  Most of the work that is being carried out in public hospitals now is emergency care, urgent cancer care or perhaps some elective day-care procedures.  More and more, the work in our public hospitals is urgent work.  Unless we provide elective-only hospitals, we will never clear our waiting lists for elective work.  I ask the witnesses to comment on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#M01500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":769,"content":"<p>I agree with the Chairman's perfect analysis.<\/p><p>I have no argument at all.

Although this issue was part of it, I felt it was ideological in terms of the proposals for how it should be done.  I get what Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir is saying in that staff numbers are the same, as is the number of sick people who require care.  His response to Senator Colm Burke was that it was just about moving people to receive treatment in the public system.  <\/p> <p>  On the 39-hour contract, the lack of autonomy is an issue for consultants.  I am not sure if the research and development element is an issue in the context of the 39-hour week.  Obviously, their contracts would have to have on-call and other activities sewn into them.  On restricting someone at the top of his or her game professionally to a 40-hour week, is it anyone's business if they want to work 15 hours somewhere else?  I am not saying they should or should not, but I wonder if this is the way to bring the profession with us.<\/p> <p>  We have heard in the last couple of sittings of the committee that there is a very significant draw from the public into the private sector.  Senator Colm Burke referenced the situation in Cork where 12 or 14 consultants have left Cork University Hospital to move to the Bon Secours Hospital.  A number of dermatologists have left Beaumont Hospital, while an emergency department consultant recently left Tallaght Hospital to move to the Beacon Hospital.  With this in front of us, how do we pull them back?  Is the stick rather than the carrot approach the way to do it?  No amount of discussion here will make a consultant return from a private hospital to the public system.  With all the ideology in the world, we still need consultants to deliver care.  I am not sure how what is in front of me shows that is possible.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the figure of &euro;650 million a year and Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir saying it is going up to that amount.  I sat on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and get that it is building up to that amount.  Every year there is an increase in the health budget and the money seems to be absorbed into a bottomless pit.  My concern is that the &euro;650 million will be layered constantly into the overall budget with no improvements in service in return.  It might be &euro;250 million one year and then &euro;650 million, but I cannot see how we can show that money will improve services to the extent that it will encourage people to stop paying for private health insurance because they are happy with the public system.  Am I wrong in saying that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#N00700","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Trying to step back from it, our instruction was there was cross-party agreement that private medicine should be taken out of the public system.

I had four very helpful colleagues who made a significant contribution to this work and our considered view is that it can be done.  As such, it is now a matter for the political system.  It is a question of values and whether one believes it is proper that people in a public institution should be treated equally, regardless of their ability to pay.  That is a question for the political system.  I remember when equal pay was introduced in 1974, some said we could not afford it, but it is a question of values.  There are some issues where one either believes something or one does not.  If one believes it and wants to make the change, my committee was able to establish that it could be done, albeit there would be a price.  It is up to the political system to decide, in the face of competing priorities, whether achieving the goal of equal treatment in a public institution is worth it.

I would like to bring it back to the patients.  Let us put the consultants aside for a minute and ask how things would be affected for patients.  The ESRI report is good in the numbers it gives on what is going on in our public hospitals.  Those numbers will come as a surprise to many people.  For example, three quarters of the beds in public hospitals have people in them who have come through the accident and emergency departments.  Most people probably intuitively think the number is much smaller but three of every four beds in our public hospitals are filled with patients who have come in from the accident and emergency departments.  Whether we take private practice out of public hospitals or not, three of the four beds will still be filled with those people.  We will still have to care for them but we will have a lot less money because we will no longer be taking money from the insurance companies.  Three out of four beds will still be full with the same people but we will be behind because we will not be getting paid for any of that, whereas we were getting paid for about one in five of those patients.  That leaves one of every four beds.  The vast majority of those bed days are for public patients.  The ESRI report shows that less than 4% of the bed days in public hospitals are for elective private care.  That is the only bit that would change because the people will still come through the accident and emergency departments.  Less than one on 30 of the beds would have people in them who may not have been in them if we took elective private care out.  On the basis that some of those patients are in the public hospitals because the public hospitals might be able to deal with more complex matters, of those one in 30 beds, a load of them will still be filled.  Those patients will have to go through the public system because they will be availing of public facilities.  Let us assume that if we remove private practice from public hospitals, in reality it will free up about one bed in 50 in our public system.  That is broadly what it will do and that is the actual change we will see.  At the same time, we will also remove the money that pays for that one bed in 50.  We would not suddenly have one bed in 50 free and have doctors and nurses ready to treat the public patient who would go into that bed.  We are not funding that and we have a lot less money available because we are not taking any money in from the patients from the accident and emergency department.<\/p><p>If we just said that in principle it is no longer allowed to have private care in public hospitals, one bed in 50 might be freed up but we would not have the money to pay for that bed or for the doctors or nurses, and we would have significantly less money available to treat the patients in the other 49 beds.<\/p><p> I fundamentally and wholeheartedly agree with the principle of equal care in public hospitals, and I think it is enough that it is a principle.  The narrative to date has been that doing this will somehow reduce waiting lists and improve access for public patients.  Based on the analysis we have been given, it will do the opposite.  It will reduce capacity for public patients, thereby increasing waiting lists.  Is this a reasonable analysis of the numbers we have just seen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#O01900","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I am with the Deputy most the way but I am not sure it would reduce.

Deputy Donnelly asked a question about continuity of maternity care.  A fundamental reason women and their partners go for private maternity care is the continuity of care with a consultant.  I understand that people are not always guaranteed the same consultant but, in my experience, a consultant will introduce the patient to his or her colleague as the consultant who will look after the patient when the original consultant is on holidays and that he or she is aware of the situation.  Women want this.  They do not want to be examined by somebody different every time, particularly with complex pregnancies.  They want the assurance that they do not have to tell the whole story every time they go in for a check-up.  It is regrettable this was not examined because it is a key reason for private health insurance.  My only access was at that time.  It is a critical point in people's lives and there is definitely a desire for continuity of care.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the children's hospital, the committee has heard there will be four or six suites for private paediatric care.  While I understand why this is, if this is where we are going, it sends the wrong message to have private rooms in the new hospital.  I understand why the contract is as it is and why doctors want it but it seems wholly unfair that if my child has an eye problem that is not an emergency and Deputy Donnelly's child has a similar eye problem but he does not have private insurance, one of the children will get preferential care in the new hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#P01500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":812,"content":"<p>Is there an answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#P01600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I do not think there was a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#P01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":814,"content":"<p>There was a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#P01800","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":815,"content":"<p>Was there?

I will provide an update by way of the opening statement and then we will take questions.  We are one year into implementation.  I first met the committee a year ago when the office was being set up.  I wish to update the committee on what we are doing in terms of the action plan and where that is at.  Then I will step back a little, say what we have done and analyse the implementation to date in terms of what are the foundational steps we have taken, what key enablers we have been able to put in place, what the next steps will be and what the dependencies are on that.<\/p> <p>  The slide shows where we were last year.  We very much value the ongoing opportunity to update the committee on a quarterly basis and to get its input.  The effort we are making in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office is based on an all-party Oireachtas approach and we cannot do it without the continuing support of the committee, which we welcome.<\/p> <p>  The implementation advisory council has also met four times so far during the year.  That is under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom Keane.  We have very good input and advice from the council.  We very much appreciate its work.  The implementation office was set up in quarter 1 of this year, in January.  We published our action plan, which has taken a very programmatic approach to translating the vision of the all-party Oireachtas committee into the first year of its implementation.  We are embarking now on the action plan for 2020 to 2022.<\/p> <p>  In terms of governance we also have the high-level delivery board, comprising the Secretaries Generals of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform and Health, plus the chief executive of the HSE and me.  The board discusses issues of cross-departmental importance to Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Mr. Dean Sullivan is present.  Since the advent of the new HSE board, we have put in place oversight taking a joint implementation approach for two key programmes that need to be rolled out in the coming years.  We have established a joint implementation approach to that, which feeds through into direct oversight by the Minister.  That is the system of governance.  It is now well-established and is working well.  It gives grounding to a programmatic and systematic implementation.<\/p> <p>  Our action plan update, as of September, is going to the Government next week.  I am pleased to share that we have taken our workstreams approach through the action plan and that we have reported on all of the different elements through the action plan.  The summary is that 114 deliverables were due by September and we are 93% on track.  As for the eight that are off track; they will be back on track by the end of this year.  That is the reason we put them into the orange category.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work that has been done by colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to bring these deliverables to bear.  Our office is there to make sure that things happen; we are not doing a lot of the work.  Where things go off track, we have an input and we are there to make sure things stay on track.  We acknowledge the work that has happened.  We are 93% on track and will be there by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  I will analyse where we are with the implementation process.  I have categorised the process into foundational decisions without which we could not have moved forward.  These have all taken place and were deliverables in the action plan.  They have all taken place since we came into office.  In the past year the decision was made on the six new regional health areas.  On the previous occasion I was before the committee I asked if we could please stay with the plan and do it because we knew there was not unanimous agreement on regional health areas but everyone stayed with it.  I acknowledge that and thank the committee members and the system for staying with that because it is a foundational piece.  That allows us to plan for six integrated regional plans.  I will come to that later.<\/p> <p>  The second foundational decision was to get the new HSE board and CEO in place.  That is already putting a discipline around what is happening.  We have a very good working relationship with the HSE through the new CEO and with the deputy director general, Mr. Dean Sullivan, who is present.  A third foundational piece was the GP contract, again, without which we could not move forward.  It was a key enabler especially in the context of chronic disease management and that will be rolled out from next year.  Another key enabler is the enhanced nurse contract, which will make sure services can move seamlessly between the hospital and community.<\/p> <p>  A fifth piece we have been very pleased to see being put in place is through the office of Dr. Colm Henry.  He has had a national clinical programmes review and made recommendations on what happens next in regard to them.  They are important because if we say we are going to have six regional plans, we need them to be done in a national context.  Not every region can go off and design its own way of doing things.  It must be done in such a way that we have one national cancer programme, one neurorehabilitation strategy and there are many other strategies that are national and that can be interpreted in a regional way.  Putting that foundational piece in place has been extremely good.<\/p> <p>  We considered the multi-annual commitment to recruiting staff in the community as another important piece that was put in through the budget because it allows us to plan in a multi-annual way.  As members are aware, that is unusual because most service plans are done on an annual basis so we are very pleased that we will have visibility into the future for those.  We want and need more of that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of foundational decisions, the dialogue forum has been a critical initiative to strengthen the relationship with voluntary providers.  As members are aware, section 38 and 39 organisations are a significant part of the system.  Putting the dialogue forum in place following the Catherine Day report is another very important foundational decision.  Those are not everything but they are the ones I have picked out for today.  There will be more in the action plan that will be released next week.<\/p> <p>  Next I wish to focus on some of the key enablers that have been put in place.  The forum that has been put in place to look at the oversight implementation of the role of public health doctors, in particular in the context of regional planning, is important.  If we are to have population-based planning we need an enhanced public health doctor role.  The conversations that are happening at the moment through the office of the chief medical officer in the Department and our HSE colleagues with the public health doctors will be concluded by the end of this year.  They are a key enabler.<\/p><p>The postgraduate medical education strategy forum, which is being chaired by Mary Doyle, is another really important initiative.  This forum is looking at long-term postgraduate medical education and how it will be planned into the future.  <\/p><p> We cannot have a shared care record or an electronic health record unless we have an individual health identifier office, which was put in place this year and is being staffed.  The individual health identifier numbers have come across from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Again, if this had not happened, we would not be able to roll out our shared records so this was a very important key enabler.  <\/p><p> I consider e-pharmacy to be extremely important and one of the first and most important pieces of a shared care record.  We have put the governance in place through the HSE to roll that out as urgently as possible.  Regarding the joint initiative between the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Health on housing options for our ageing population, an implementation group chaired by Leo Kearns has been set up.  If we are to keep people well and keep them in their own homes for as long as possible, looking at alternatives to nursing homes is critical.  This group produced a very good strategy which an implementation group is examining to make sure it is rolled out.  <\/p><p> Mr. Sullivan and I put an elective hospital oversight group in place.  We know that the Government made the decision to have elective hospitals in Galway, Cork and Dublin but we need to address this issue in a national context in order that everybody in the country is covered for elective care.  Those groups are working with us.  The timeframe for the group's deliberations is 12 weeks and it is progressing very well.  A clinical lead for trauma has been appointed.  Mr. Sullivan is leading on this project, which involves naming and rolling out trauma centres in Dublin.  A decision will be made on that in the next two months.  <\/p><p> I have not addressed every issue but I have highlighted areas that are very important and without which we would not be able to move forward.  There is a commitment to have a single assessment tool.  The preferred bidder is being selected and that will be rolled out from February.  Selecting and rolling out the single assessment tool is a key enabler.  <\/p><p> I will now discuss the budget allocation for Sl&aacute;intecare in 2020.  The budget contained many initiatives that are what I would call Sl&aacute;intecare-friendly but these initiatives specifically come into our section.  We are very pleased that we have the enhanced community fund, a multi-annual fund to hire up to up to 1,000 therapists, nurses and other front-line staff to care for people in the community, including advisers for people with dementia.  This will allow us to treat people in the community closer to their own homes, thereby reducing community waiting lists.  I am happy to discuss how this will be rolled out when we come to questions but it is very important.  We cannot move people out of hospital unless we have the capacity in the community to do so.  The all-party Oireachtas committee's report was very clear on that.  The allocation for the fund will rise to &euro;60 million in 2021.<\/p><p> I will describe a few projects covered by the integration fund of &euro;20 million.  There has been a huge response from the system in terms of ideas for doing things better and in a different way and scaling good ideas.  The &euro;12 million care redesign fund is about providing care at the least form of complexity, in accordance with the clinical care programmes, to people in the right location.  Again, this is very good work that we need to scale.  It is all about moving people out of hospital to the place of least complexity, as appropriate.   <\/p><p> I am happy for Ms Healy to take more questions on citizen and staff engagement but I will touch on a few matters.  We have a very good response from the system, particularly from staff.  Everybody is now talking about Sl&aacute;intecare and how they are doing things in the Sl&aacute;intecare way.  They talk about Sl&aacute;intecare in action and how they can do things in a more integrated and joined up way.  It has become very much a language as well as action across the system.  We have been very careful to engage with all the different healthcare professionals, such as nurses and doctors, including at conferences, to hear their suggestions about doing things in a different and more joined up way.  We have received a very good response and that this is embedded across the system.  More work needs to be done but there has been a very good start.<\/p><p> In respect of wider citizen engagement, we have been carrying out joint initiatives with Healthy Ireland.  A very interesting Health Reform Alliance event was held last week and other consultation events with citizens have been held.  We have also worked with staff around values in action, conferences and briefings.  We welcome our engagement with this committee and elected representatives through the quarterly action plan report, committee attendance and other briefings, as needed.  We are always open to discussing any aspect of the process with members or their colleagues.<\/p><p> I mentioned the integration fund because it was a highlight during the year when so many interesting projects applied for funding.  A total of 477 applications were received, of which 122 projects were successful.  They are found all around the country.  The little dots in the slide represent the locations around the country.  The goal was to promote the engagement and empowerment of citizens in the care of their own health, to scale and share examples of best practice and processes for chronic disease management and care of older people in particular, and to encourage innovations in the shift of care to the community or provide hospital avoidance measures.  We received very interesting ideas, some of which involved scaling existing things while others proposed new initiatives.<\/p><p> I will discuss some sample projects.  Jigsaw Online is an e-mental health platform.  Jigsaw is very engaged and involved in youth mental health and the e-mental health platform the organisation is setting up for young people is a very interesting project.  Other examples of projects include one by Epilepsy Ireland and Alone's BConnect project.  Alone's project is very innovative.  It is talking about linking healthcare, social care and community care using technology and services.  Other projects include Beating Breathlessness by the Asthma Society; Cro&iacute;, West of Ireland Cardiac Foundation's MySl&aacute;inte community lifestyle programme; and Diabetes care in the mid-west.  The latter project was a very interesting one that involved a podiatry-led pathway for timely provision of footwear and orthotics in the community.  Basically, it was about preventing amputations through early intervention.  It is a critical project.  Another project involves rolling out FIT teams in Mullingar, Wexford and west Wicklow.  We know the FIT teams have been proven to work in Limerick and other places.  These teams go into hospitals, identify people in the emergency department and try to get early interventions so they stop older people in particular from having to be admitted to hospital and wrap the services around them.  It is a very good project.  There are around 300 staff within the integration fund projects.  As we know, the staff are the core of services and health and social care is all about services.  <\/p><p> We have work to do on eligibility and entitlement.  We are submitting a memorandum to Government on the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, developing a roadmap for universal access and establishing an interdepartmental group on eligibility and entitlement.  We would love to discuss with the committee whether there should be a citizens assembly on the issue of eligibility and entitlement.  <\/p><p> Regarding access and capacity, I mentioned that two key programmes are being rolled out using a joint integration approach.  The left hand side of the slide details the regional integrated care areas, RICA, programme while the right hand side details the capacity-access programme.  We know we need to create more capacity in the system.  We know we need 2,600 more beds and more staff and that we must shift care from hospitals to the community and focus on prevention.  This framework provides an interesting way of approaching how we will do that and names projects to achieve this.  Some of the key ones to pull out are healthy living to scale patient empowerment integration fund programmes.  An awful lot of programmes in there involve patient empowerment, social inclusion and social prescribing.  We need to implement housing options for our ageing population.  They are just two initiatives.  With regard to enhanced community care, we need to recruit 1,000 new front-line community staff, implement alternative paths for unscheduled care and diagnostics and procure the shared care record.<\/p><p> On hospital productivity, we need to optimise usage of existing hospital beds and decide locations of elective hospitals and procure design teams for them.  These are the projects for next year and the year after in the context of the capacity plan.  It is very important that they are put in the right sequence and that decisions are made in the right order.<\/p><p> I shall now turn to regional integrated care areas.  We had a very good meeting with the chief executive officers of the hospital groups and the community organisations two weeks ago and we asked them if they would be willing, able and up for doing joint planning from the bottom up for each of the six regions.  They have come back and have nominated people they would like to be involved.  We also want to get patient representatives and representation from the section 38 and section 39 organisations, and from the public health doctors, in order that we can begin in earnest the regional planning for each of those six areas.  The approach we are taking is to: look at the population mapping and then to look at population needs; decide capacity planning requirements for each region; look at the enablers that need to be rolled out for the regions; and - critically - looking at the pathways of care per region.  In the next two weeks, we will have an interesting opportunity when Carolyn Gullery from Canterbury, which is often quoted as a very successful region, will come over to share her experience with and meet each of the six groups we have set up in order to look at these six integrated regional plans.  It will be very interesting and I am excited about that.  It is a great opportunity to get our regional planning right.<\/p><p> Deputy Shortall is interested in population profiling and how it is done.  Through the health intelligence section of the HSE we have done the population profiling for each of the six regions.  The profile is based on age and so on.  We can then plan what the services are that each of the regions has.  We have done that for each of the regions as a first step.<\/p><p> All of this work we are doing involves a number of dependencies.  We are quite clear about the steps we want to take and how we can roll it out, but we need to maintain the momentum that has been put down during this year, to continue the stakeholder buy-in and to ensure that we have the members' support.  If we do not have that support, if there is anything we can do better, we would be very open to that.  We also need the Government to continue to take key strategic decisions - because there are a number that need to be taken in the next short while - and to resource those decisions.  Depending on all of that, we are up for it, we are able and we have all of the structures and governance in place.  I thank the committee for its continued support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Magahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Magahy for that comprehensive overview of progress.

One has to be able to get care when one needs it, it has to be high-quality in nature and it has to be at a price that does not cause a person undue financial hardship.  Unfortunately, we are moving rapidly in the opposite direction.  Access within the public health system is collapsing.  We have the worst level of access ever in the history of the State and we have by far the worst access to healthcare anywhere in the developed world.  It was getting better quite quickly but over the past five or six years, it has been growing rapidly worse.  Over the past three or four years, the decline has accelerated.  I fear that we have passed a tipping point whereby some of the negative feedback loops are reinforcing the damage already done.  Word has got out within the clinical community globally that Ireland may not be a great place to come and work as a doctor, nurse or midwife for reasons relating to working conditions, etc.  These things reinforce themselves.<\/p> <p>  Ms Magahy has a very good, attractive-looking slide in her presentation that illustrates the different parts of the system.  I made a few notes as I went through it.  In my area of Wicklow, mental health services pretty much do not exist.  I have no doubt that it is the same in many other areas.  They are now telling people that they are not even going to bother putting them on a waiting list because the service just does not exist any more.  Self-care in the advanced medical sense of having diagnostics and working with GP-led teams to manage one's own care also does not really exists.  Dentistry services exist but they are too expensive for most people to access in any meaningful way.  For the first time ever, in many instances it now takes several weeks to see a GP.  A group of pensioners in Wicklow town recently told me that if they call their GP regarding, for example, respiratory issues that need to be seen to immediately or the person could end up in the accident and emergency department, it can be three weeks before they are seen.  GP care has never been as hard to access.  That is if one can access it.  A new patient cannot actually get a GP pretty much anywhere in Wicklow any longer.  Occupational therapy appointments may take four years if one is a really severe case.  For a child to get access to speech and language appointments, it can be three, four or five years before he or she is seen.  In fact, they are beginning to send out letters now saying that it will be at least two years and that a time cannot be given because there is no money, resources or therapists.  This is the reality faced by children, mums and dads.<\/p> <p>  If one gets to a hospital, to St. Vincent's, for example, there could be a wait of a few days on a trolley.  A person would be lucky to get a bed.  People are terrified of having to go into accident and emergency departments.  Diagnostics have reached the point where people are just trying to borrow money to pay for private appointments because they are being told it could be six months, a year or two years before they can get the scans their doctors think they need.  If a person gets a scan and is referred for specialist care, it might be another year or two before he or she gets to see that doctor.  If that doctor says that an operation is required it could be another year or two years before that is done.  This is the reality.  Social workers in Wicklow have so few resources they are working out of their cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#V00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":845,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs to ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#V00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I am coming to it.

I will come back to access in hospitals shortly.  This is why it was so important that the thousand therapists are being funded.  Prioritising the allocation of them to address community waiting lists, staffing of primary care centres and keeping people out of hospital is critical.  This is what we will be working through with Dean over the next couple of weeks.  The Deputy is absolutely right that Sl&aacute;intecare is all about moving care to the place of least complexity, trying to prevent things happening in the first place and resourcing of the community.  Our one mantra in the programme and implementation office was always \"Let us resource the community properly and do it in an organised way\".  Patients will see the benefits of that next year.  Will everybody see the benefits immediately?  Probably not.  Will there be a start?  Yes, there will.

Half of this is due to hospitals not being used optimally and approximately half is due to people who should be in different locations.  Deputy Donnelly mentioned respiratory illness.  We are outliers in terms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, occupancy in hospitals.  We need to put services around those people in the community.  That is part of what the integration fund is about, and the enhanced nurse contract will also help us to do that.  In alluding to all these key enablers in our presentation, we were trying to say those things will make a difference.  The GP contract and chronic disease management will make a difference, but going back to Deputy Donnelly's main point, we are not using optimally what we have.

I am not sure I would describe access as having collapsed.  The lists were unacceptable a year ago, and they are still unacceptable now.  It is a key priority for the HSE, the Department and the Minister to tackle those waiting times, not just for themselves but because of what they mean for individuals waiting for care and the concern and waste the issue causes in the system in terms of patients cycling through it, going back to their GPs, tipping up to emergency departments and so on.  Tackling this is an absolute priority of the organisation I am in and Ms Magahy.  We need to recognise, though, that the work to which Ms Magahy alluded, the PA Consulting capacity planning work commissioned by the Department just over a year ago, has flagged up material capacity shortfalls in the system.  Efforts are being made to address those.  That is the reality.  That work also recognises, as Ms Magahy said, that there are opportunities to use more effectively the capacity we have.<\/p> <p>  I will make a final point, which is again consistent with the Government's commitment around all this.  Ms Magahy referred to the &euro;12 million care redesign fund.  That will be targeted at, among other things, the access issue and delivery of care in a different way and in different settings of lower complexity.  There is also an uplift in funding for the NTPF this year within the letter of determination from &euro;75 million to &euro;100 million.  That funding will be very helpful in trying to tackle precisely the problem Deputy Donnelly talked about.  I am confident we will begin to see a change during 2020.  I think there are opportunities, especially on the scheduled care side of the house, where a lot of the waits to which the Deputy alluded are, to begin to make progress on that and to start to build confidence in all our stakeholders.  I think the unscheduled care will be more challenging.  The reality is that there is a demographic pressure there.  Admissions to hospital will continue to rise every year.  Capacity is tight.  We will make progress there but I do not think we will be as quick as with the progress on the scheduled care side of the house.  I hope, if we are back here in six to nine months, that we will begin to see that tanker starting to turn, but we can revisit the issue then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#W01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":862,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Donnelly have a further short question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#W01500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":863,"content":"<p>No.  I will wait.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#W01600","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I missed some of Ms Magahy's presentation but, in my defence, I was getting the flu shot.

That is compared to December 2014.  While there has been a 24% increase in administration and management staff, there has been only a 3.7% increase in the number of public health nurses.  Can we be given a figure as to the increase in public health nurses that is going to happen over the next 12 months?  Although my colleague has given the impression that the whole health service has collapsed, the number of outpatient appointments has not decreased.  The number of day care procedures has not decreased.  The number of operations happening per week, per month and per annum have not decreased.  The witnesses would probably agree with that.  If anything, the numbers in all areas have increased.  In case people get the concept that there are 118,000 people in the HSE sitting around doing nothing all day, that is not the position.  They are all working very hard.  However, I want to raise the issue of access to diagnostics by GPs.  As regards people having to be referred in to accident and emergency departments to get access to diagnostics, what proactive work has been done?  We want to keep care in the community and away from the hospital.  What has been done to make diagnostic services available to GPs in a faster timescale than currently is available?<\/p> <p>  I have raised the issue of dieticians consistently over the last three or four years and nothing has been done on it.  We have a system whereby if a nursing home patient requires advice or consultation with a dietician, he or she has to be taken in to the hospital.  What are we doing to have dieticians call to nursing homes once every month or two to reduce the overall cost of this?  If a patient has to be taken into a hospital to see a dietician, the likelihood is that two staff from the community hospital or whatever have to travel with them.  There is a significant cost and time factor.  It is a very simple issue where work can be done in the community rather than in a hospital.  I would like to hear answers on the three issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#X03500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I will take the question on access to diagnostics.

It is very important that they are in the pipeline, as it were, and will be ready to do it.  A new workforce model is being developed to meet GP and patient needs, as well as new models of education and training.  I am happy to supply details of that.  It is the work of the HSE's national clinical programme for radiology.  It has mapped all the different radiology infrastructure throughout the country.

The most important thing, to refer back to Deputy Donnelly's point, is that people have timely access to diagnostics.  That is more important than whether it is through a GP or whether the diagnostics are delivered close to the patient's home.  The first thing we must do is ensure that the capacity in the system in Ireland is sufficient to respond in a timely way to the needs of the population.  We must get that in some type of order, and that is some way ahead at present.  However, through the same process we were talking about previously we will start to see progress on it during 2020 and beyond.  Then we can move to make it ever more accessible for GPs and so forth and, in due course, get to a position where, if it is entirely reasonable for somebody to be referred by the person's GP for a scan of some description, it does not go around the houses and we end up with that service being delivered in a local setting.<\/p> <p>  On the dietetics issue, we could pick a number of pathways.  Some of the eye care pathways are a little like that as well, with people going around the houses to an extent.  A number of pathway processes are being reviewed by the clinical programmes with a view to streamlining them and identifying whether there is any added value in the patient going through two or three hoops when care could be delivered more straightforwardly and locally without the various hoops on the way.  There are issues to be resolved and assurances given to various clinical staff to understand what that would look like.  They are motivated by, among other things, ensuring that patients do not fall between the cracks.  That is how these pathways in some cases have developed.  However, in the 21st century there is certainly scope, and dietetics is one area, to make the pathway much more straightforward for the patient so he or she does not have to go via a hospital to get physiotherapy, dietetics, diagnostics or whatever else.  It should be entirely possible for patients to access those at local level without going anywhere near a hospital or a hospital practitioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":911,"content":"<p>With regard to dieticians, one of the issues is that they will not deal with community hospitals because their travel expenses from the hospital to the community hospital are not covered.

It is clear that a great deal of work has been done on the detailed planning for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and the outworking of many aspects of the recommendations.  That is commendable.<\/p> <p>  The missing piece is the funding required to make these recommendations happen in the short term as opposed to stretching out over future years, so we get beyond the point of pilot projects and individual funds for interesting things.  They are not on a sufficient scale to achieve the type of step change that is required and was envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It is regrettable.  The opportunity arose in the budget for the Government and those who support it to allocate the necessary funds at a level that would achieve that step change and ensure that citizens would see an appreciable improvement in services.  That can only happen if funding is provided on the scale to achieve those major changes and the shifts in where we provide services.  It is only when that happens that people will starting seeing a difference and will be able to achieve access.<\/p> <p>  The main problem for many of our citizens is that access is so poor.  An example of that are the issues of eligibility and entitlement, on which the committee was very strong.  We need to move beyond the current arrangement where people are eligible to receive services if the services are available but there is no legal entitlement.  That is the big difference between healthcare and, for example, social welfare.  I can appreciate that the witnesses are in an awkward position and that they must talk about the issue of entitlement potentially being kicked to a citizens' assembly, but the Sl&aacute;intecare report referred to extending legal entitlement from the start of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>  There are other big ticket items that must be dealt with and where there has not been much progress.  One of those is the consultant contract.  Earlier Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir spoke to the committee about its importance if we are to achieve the ending of private care in public hospitals, which is a key enabler and potentially a game changer in how we provide healthcare services.  Will Mr. Sullivan give us any hope that work is being done on a new consultant contract?  It was not referred to in the presentation.  This is in light of the recommendations in the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, the issues that were raised during the summer regarding the Medical Council, a high level of bullying and unacceptable practices in the hospital doctors arena, the question of specialisation, and the fact that we seem to be concentrating too much on specialisation among hospital doctors at the expense of generalists and getting people out and working more quickly.  There are indications that there is much interest in public-only contracts.  We must move quickly towards those if we are to achieve significant changes in hospital services.  Perhaps Mr. Sullivan will tell us the position with the new consultant contract and when we might see some product from that.<\/p> <p>  Equally, there is the GP contract.  We know there is a major shortage of GPs and we know that many new graduates would willingly stay here if they could afford to do so and if they were not expected to set up their own practice or work as an assistant.  There is a programme for Government commitment with regard to the introduction of salaried GPs.  Is anything happening on that?  There is a new GP contract, but as far as I can see there has been no progress on salaried GPs.<\/p> <p>  There are other areas on which I have questions.<\/p><p>One of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report that was not covered in the report before us relates to legislation.  If memory serves me, we recommended that legislation be introduced in seven areas.  One of the most important is the question of accountability, throughout the system, starting with ministerial accountability for the provision of adequate services.  It was recommended to us on the committee that introducing such accountability would be a game changer in respect of the politics of the issue.  What is the status of that proposal and of the recommendation on legislating for accountability at clinical and administrative level?  The chair of the board, Dr. Tom Keane, was very strong on the need to legislate for clinical accountability.  As far as I recall, he stated it was one of the most important steps we could take.  Given that our guests have not mentioned legislation, they might comment on that.<\/p><p> On the question of entitlement, is putting it to a citizens' assembly the only recommendation?  We expected progress to be made in the area.  I get the distinct impression the matter is being kicked into a long process.  When is there likely to be some progress in the area? <\/p><p> On the additional 1,000 community staff who were flagged in the budget, I very much welcome the decision in principle but I am anxious to hear the planned timescale.  If those who have control of budgetary matters had provided the funding in a more upfront manner, the staff would be recruited upfront, rather than in what has been described as the medium or longer term.  To what extent has Ms Magahy's office control over the allocation of those staff posts?  What is the basis on which it will allocate those posts?  We in the committee were strong about having objective resource allocation systems in place and removing the politics from the allocation of resources.  Will Ms Magahy update us in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#Y01300","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":923,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shortall for recognising the work that was done by colleagues in the HSE and throughout the system.

I highlighted a couple of aspects in the presentation, including the memo to Government on the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, which is important.  A unit is being established within the Department of Health specifically to examine eligibility and entitlement, and will be resourced to do so.  There has not yet been a concerted effort but there was acknowledgement through the Secretary General that it would happen and we are very pleased about that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of eligibility and entitlement touches on several Departments.  As the committee will be aware, if one is eligible to a medical card, one will also be entitled to other benefits.  We have agreed at the high-level delivery board that an interdepartmental group will be set up to examine eligibility and entitlement.  They are tangible steps that will give emphasis and momentum to that question, which is important.  The Minister recently attended the universal healthcare forum in New York and is very committed to universal healthcare.  It is important to get the homework done in respect of what universal healthcare means and produce a pathway to what it will cost.  The issue of cost explains why we proposed a citizens' assembly.

Nevertheless, engaging the citizens in a conversation about the path to it would be useful.  It is not about not providing it but rather about seeking the informed views on how we would go about providing it, which we would determine by gathering the citizens' opinions.  I am a fan of the citizens' assembly as an important, structured way of gathering views.  While we are mindful of the House's own work over a period, carried out by many Members of the Oireachtas, the committee and the experts who appeared before it, we have discovered in our engagement that the public has little knowledge or understanding of the matter.  The citizens' assembly structure is a way of focusing the desired media attention on such conversations and discussions and of genuinely involving the public.<\/p> <p>  That is a short summary of why we propose a citizens' assembly.  There is a head of steam behind it and we would love for it to be done.  It is not a way of kicking the can down the road.  In fact, it is the opposite.

I imagine that the issue will play out over the next several months and we will return to the Government for a decision.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy indicated that it is not just money that keeps people in a job, although it is an important factor.  I acknowledge her point.  It is also about the atmosphere - not just physical but also cultural - in which they work.  If people cannot get access to theatres to perform operations or see people in the correct circumstances, it becomes hard for all healthcare staff to work in such conditions.  The elective hospitals initiative we have done, which was intended to streamline unscheduled and scheduled care, will help in that regard.  It will help people to have their theatre time and will keep professionals interested and engaged in their work.  That is as, if not more, important as money to the professionals to whom we have spoken.  Highly skilled people being unable to get into theatres on time is not conducive to retention. <\/p> <p>  On resource allocation and the additional 1,000 front-line staff, I am mindful a resource allocation model has been applied throughout the system.

Senator Colm Burke referred to nursing homes and dietary issues.  Dietary issues seem to be important for older people who are long-stay patients in hospitals.  The extent to which an appropriate diet is available to such persons seems to be much more important than we, or at least I, first anticipated.  This committee will meet some people on that issue in the not so distant future and that will hopefully be of benefit in improving quality of service and quality of life and health for people who are either in care at home or in nursing homes.  Sufficient emphasis has not been placed on dietary issues in the past.  From what we now see, hear and read, that is an area in which we can contribute greatly, at little cost, to an area that could relieve the burden on many aspects of services in many ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#AA00700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":937,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments which I will relay to the team and they will be pleased.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has asked several questions and I will try to answer them in sequence.  We are on track so far but we have an awful lot to do.  We are only in year one.  It is only 13 months since I sat before the committee without a team and with no staff.  We started pulling it together from scratch and working with colleagues in the HSE and the Department.  We have put structures in place now so we have a fair wind behind us and I acknowledge the work of my colleagues in the Department and the HSE as a part of that.  We are on track so far but we cannot rest on our laurels.<\/p> <p>  One of the first things that the director general, Paul Reid, asked about when he started was how the HSE was doing and how the board of the HSE, with its new remit and governance structures, was going to interface with the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office.  There was a genuine acknowledgement on his part and on mine that we need to work seamlessly together.  One cannot have one piece of work in the Department and another in the HSE, trying to do things that are not joined at the hip.  I am delighted to have agreed with Mr. Sullivan that we are going to have a joint implementation approach to capacity planning, in particular, and the roll-out of the regional integrated health plan.  That took a while to work through but is now in place.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the single assessment tool which is critical because it is the basis of the statutory home care scheme.  All older people and, eventually, people with a disability will be assessed through the single assessment tool.  Their requirements will be looked at and it will form the basis of the statutory home care scheme.  I should have alluded to that as another important eligibility entitlement initiative when I was answering questions from Deputy Shortall.<\/p> <p>  The tool is being piloted at the moment in a few different areas and they are working through how it is happening in practice and talking with the various people on the ground about glitches and improvements that need to be made if there are any.  It will be fully rolled out from February onwards.  It is a very good thing that is happening.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the postgraduate medical education strategy is very important.  It is joined up.  It is being chaired by Mary Doyle, the former Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, who is a capable and knowledgeable person.  I have a meeting with that team this afternoon to see how that is going.  It is a very important piece of the jigsaw.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy may not know that HIQA is organising that a survey for patients will go into nursing homes and that will feed in nicely to seeing what the response is to food and we look forward to seeing the results of that.

I hope this all works out because it is two and a half years since the report of the Select Committee on the Future of Healthcare, chaired by Deputy Shortall and upon which Deputy Durkan and I sat, was published.  We are now 25% of the way into a ten-year plan.  It is not Ms Magahy's fault because she had nothing to work with initially apart from our report.  That committee report was born out of a frustration with the system and situation as it was.  We all worked together to try and leave our bias behind and work to the future.<\/p> <p>  Following on from that, part of the issue I see now is the constant leeching of top-end consultants that this committee spoke about in the previous session and last week.  Those consultants are leaving our public sector to join our private sector and we have not yet managed to stop that bleed.<\/p><p>As long as that continues, I fear we cannot deliver this, despite whatever else we do, unless we have the hospital consultants to lead this healthcare provision.  We need to focus on the consultants.  Some 50% of NCHDs are not in training posts.  We have the leaching of the top people but in terms of succession planning, we do not have the bodies coming along in the future that are wedded to the system and part of a structured career path.  If all of this worked out, and everybody was up for it, how are we going to guarantee that we have the consultants to lead the delivery of healthcare?<\/p><p> The GP contract and salaried GPs was a critical point of Sl&aacute;intecare.  There has been an emergence in the larger urban areas of GPs who have general medical services, GMS contracts doing many elective and cosmetic surgeries in their clinics and many travel vaccines.  I do not class all GPs in this group.  These procedures are not jobs that GPs should be doing in a strained health service.  I would much prefer to see my child's burst eardrum being seen over somebody getting elective Botox in a surgery.  I am quite concerned about the use of GPs' time.  This is not a criticism as they have to pay rents, rates and salaries and there is probably more money in elective cosmetic surgeries than in weeping children's ears.  I am concerned that if we do not go down the salaried GP route, we will always be competing where the skill sets of the GPs are siphoned off into sectors that are more profitable and have no public health value.<\/p><p> On pharmacists, we spoke about patients earlier and often speak of them as if they are all same type of patient.  Any of us who works in the health service, however, knows that there are major complexities in patients.  I am reminded of a pharmacist in Galway who took it upon himself to monitor ten complex patients across gender and age groups.  This pharmacist together with the local public hospital and GPs, they held the hands of ten people as they went through their complex lives with their complex medical conditions.  It was a loose study, but the ten individuals were admitted to hospital 30 times in the year prior to this intervention, an average of three admissions.  Following this intervention, there were only four admissions in the next year.  My concern is that we look on patients as if they are all the same and we never hold the hand the most vulnerable.  We just keep firing money and expensive injections and treatments at them but we do not follow up whether the injection goes into their body or whether they turn up for their appointment.  The group of people in Galway proved that when resources are directed at the most vulnerable and complex cases, this can have a significant impact on hospital admissions.  Various figures are bandied around, but there is a claim that up to 60% of hospital admissions are due to medication errors.  If, as Deputy Donnelly mentioned earlier, three quarters of beds in public hospitals are occupied by people who come in through emergency departments, investment in the more complex patients with great need seems to be the key to try to reduce the bed occupancy rate and waiting lists.  How is Sl&aacute;intecare progressing with the pharmacists?  The fundamental basis of Sl&aacute;intecare was need and not ability to pay, and a move towards the community.  It must be ten years since pharmacists started doing the flu vaccine.  It started off - with no offence intended towards the Chairman - with the question as to how pharmacists might manage and what if some person died or had an anaphylactic reaction?  Some ten years later, is ten years correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#AA01100","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":942,"content":"<p>Yes, I believe it was ten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#BB00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I was expecting a child when I believe I may have been in the first tranche of recipients.  It was said that pharmacists would not want to give injections to people but we all got over it.  How will the role of the pharmacist in the community be expanded to prevent this 60% of admissions that are based on medication errors?<\/p> <p>  I know I am boring everybody to tears, but some of the things that happen are so common.  Someone seeing a consultant in a private hospital, for example, and does not think that he or she needs to tell his or her GP in Clare what is going on with the cardiologist in Dublin.  They then go somewhere else to get something else done.  They then get a prescription in one pharmacy, and get the other one in the pharmacy beside the private hospital.  They go home and are taking three times the medication they should be on. This is common.  I get worried when we talk about citizens' assemblies and such matters when we have not focused on why people are turning up in emergency departments.  Accidents and emergencies happen.  However, if we invested in the prevention of man-made errors, we could free up capacity in our system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#BB00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":944,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy allow me to have some of those questions to be answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#BB00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":945,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#BB00500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":946,"content":"<p>There are a number of minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019102300002#BB00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I agree 100% that pharmacists should, and could, do more.

The e-pharmacy project will be the quickest win in value for the patient from a shared record point of view.

The HSE did a great deal of work on cutting back on elemental feeds and so on.  To follow on from Deputy Durkan's commentary, wound management and protein content of food is vital for older people and people with an injury, old or young. I agree with the Deputy Durkan that while hospital meals have improved in recent years, a fundamental part of growing and repairing a patient's body seems to have been neglected.  It is unacceptable that older people or people with swallow issues can be handed a carton of Ensure.<\/p><p>Regardless of their age or the complexity of their needs, people receiving care have a very basic right to have a balanced diet made available to them if they are not able to get their own food, which will obviously be the case if they are in a nursing home.  Diet has to mesh with medication, doctors and nursing.  This issue cannot be left on its own.  There is no point in a patient getting wonderful wound care from wound specialists using really expensive pressure sore bandages if he or she is getting no protein.  That wound will never heal.

When representatives of the IMO appeared here last week, they identified the shared care record as one of the critical enablers of reform of the health service because it crosses all clinical disciplines and drives efficiency.  A practitioner could log into a shared care record and see what diagnostics have already been carried out and do not have to be duplicated, as well as finding information on a patient's current medication.  This is absolutely critical, more so than clinical input and numbers of consultants, nurses and allied professions.  It drives efficiency.  One of the critical points in the Sl&aacute;intecare report was the need for a shared care record and a single health identifier in order that people could be tracked through the system.  It drives efficiency so well.  It would substantially reduce waiting lists because there are many people on several waiting lists seeking service from several different hospitals and disciplines.<\/p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report set aside a figure of &euro;850 million or &euro;875 million for the shared care record.  In the current climate it is unlikely that this kind of money will be available in the short or medium term.  How is the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office approaching the introduction of a shared care record?  I see that e-health has been included under \"Workstream 1\" in the submission.

We have had this conversation before.  There is already an awful lot of data, including data from the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, GP data which will hopefully come on stream, patient administration system, PAS, data from the hospital system and data on radiology from the national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS.  There is an awful lot of system data.  We now need a platform that can get these data sets to talk to each other.  That is different to the electronic health record, which has already been rolled out in some of the maternity hospitals and St. James's Hospital.  The shared care record is more urgent and more applicable from the patient's perspective.  Good progress is being made but a real focus will be needed next year.

If everything in the world worked exactly right, at the right time and infinite resources were available to do everything else, 2,600 beds would be needed.  The review states, however, that up to 7,200 beds would be needed.  Experts have informed me that the number is probably somewhere in between those two figures, in other words, between 4,500 and 5,000 extra beds will be needed.  Given that, is the independent review group worried that we are planning to fail?

We were talking earlier about the suboptimal use of some current beds.  The first and most immediate target is to try to get the beds in place.  The second target is to try to get the elective hospitals streamlining the scheduled and unscheduled care.  Mr. Sullivan and I are working assiduously on naming and getting that capacity in place.  The next target is the needs of the regions.  That is how we are going about allocating those beds.

After all of that, the figure left was the 2,600 number to which the Deputy referred.  Those were the assumptions as opposed to five things all having to break perfectly, in which case only 2,600 beds would be needed.  I am happy to proceed on the basis of getting 2,600 beds in place, and implementing the other interventions that are necessary so that only 2,600 beds are needed.  We will then see where we are.  There are an awful lot of moving parts in health and social care that the Deputy is well aware of.  Population needs may change over the next ten years and so on.  We will work towards that in good faith.  We are constantly looking at it in any event.  We have processes in place and we have the model whereby we re-run and test things and so on.

That is harder to predict because sometimes it might have a ten-year impact if a measure is started now.  It is also harder to argue for resources for such a measure but that is where we should be trying to make changes.  The Deputy mentioned the importance of diet, prevention, exercise and all the usual things and asked if we were doing enough on prevention and dealing with the obesity crisis.  There are probably some brave decisions to be made next year on prevention and the budget for health and well-being.  These cut across Departments and probably need to be stepped up.

When it issued its invitation, the Brexit landscape looked quite different from how it looks today.  The agreement reached last week between the European Union and the United Kingdom on a revised withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship is a welcome development.  The agreement was endorsed unanimously by the European Council on 17 October and is now subject to ratification by the European Parliament, which I understand has indicated that it will await approval of the deal in the UK Parliament before it considers the agreement.<\/p> <p>  Critically, the deal has yet to secure approval in the UK Parliament.  As members will be aware, last night the UK Parliament approved the second reading of the Bill aimed at ratifying the withdrawal agreement.  This development is a positive signal from the British Parliament, although the timetable for the Bill envisaged for completion by 31 October was not approved.  The British Prime Minister, therefore, has paused progress on the Bill until a response to the UK request for an extension beyond 31 October is received from the EU.<\/p> <p>  The President of the European Council recommends that EU leaders approve the extension sought by the UK and is consulting other EU leaders on the matter.  The Taoiseach has today confirmed his support for President Tusk&rsquo;s proposal to grant the extension sought.  In so doing, he has made it clear it will be possible for the UK to leave before the end of January 2020 if the withdrawal agreement is approved by the UK Parliament before that date.  There is still a way to go before we will have clarity on the process in the UK Parliament and it would be neither wise nor appropriate to speculate on the ultimate outcome of current proceedings in the UK Parliament.<\/p> <p>  The Government remains firmly convinced that ratifying the withdrawal agreement is the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal.  A no-deal outcome is in no one&rsquo;s interest.  Ireland has always said that, taking account of the circumstances of the UK request, we are open to an extension to facilitate an orderly withdrawal from the EU by the UK.  This will require a unanimous decision of the European Council and President Tusk has indicated he is consulting EU leaders on the issue.  While the possibility of a no-deal Brexit appears lower now than it did a fortnight ago, the Government is nonetheless continuing apace with no-deal preparations.<\/p> <p>  I fully recognise that the constant flux in respect of Brexit has created a deep sense of insecurity for citizens and businesses alike.  It has also placed a considerable onus on businesses to engage in Brexit contingency planning and take costly mitigating actions.  I hope there will soon be clarity on the direction of travel of Brexit, which will bring about much-needed certainty for businesses.  My Department and the offices and agencies under my remit have been front and centre preparing businesses for all possible Brexit scenarios - initially for a more benign Brexit and, more recently, for a hard Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The committee's invitation asked me to address certain issues, including Brexit supports, engagement with businesses, forecasts on the potential impacts of a no-deal Brexit, stakeholders&rsquo; concerns, and supports for businesses in a no-deal Brexit.  As members will be aware, it has been the strongly held position of the Government that a no-deal Brexit is to be avoided at all costs.  The potential detriment to people&rsquo;s lives, our economy and peace on our island has been evident from various analyses and studies undertaken since 2016.  As I stated when presenting my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2020, Ireland has never been better placed to deal with a large economic shock such as a no-deal Brexit, although it would undoubtedly present an unprecedented challenge.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider what has been achieved since the start of 2016.  Almost 220,000 jobs have been created and the unemployment rate stands at 5.2%, the lowest since 2007.  We are planning and investing for the future through Future Jobs Ireland; the nine regional enterprise plans and the regional enterprise development fund; and Project Ireland 2040, including the &euro;500 million disruptive technologies fund.<\/p> <p>  In the period since the UK Brexit referendum in 2016, my Department and the offices and agencies under my remit, working with other agencies of the State, have been very busy preparing for Brexit.  A full suite of financial Brexit measures and supports was put in place in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Some of the most significant Brexit initiatives introduced include: Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit scorecard, the Be Prepared grant, the new market discovery fund and advisory clinics, local enterprise offices' technical assistance grant for micro-exporters, and Brexit mentoring and advisory services; Intertrade Ireland&rsquo;s Start to Plan Brexit vouchers, Brexit implementation vouchers and Brexit advisory services; the &euro;300 million working capital Brexit loan scheme; and the &euro;300 million future growth loan scheme.<\/p> <p>  In addition, budget 2020 provided for a &euro;650 million contingency fund available for the business, agriculture and tourism sectors in the context of a no-deal Brexit scenario.  Of this, &euro;110 million will become immediately available to my Department to support vulnerable but viable firms.  This is the first wave of funding that will, if necessary, be used to activate four main schemes, which build on existing supports introduced in the past three budgets.<\/p><p>These four schemes are a &euro;45 million transition fund for manufacturing and internationally traded services firms of fewer than ten employees; a &euro;42 million rescue and restructuring fund for firms in all sectors with acute liquidity or insolvency problems; an &euro;8 million transformation fund for larger firms, with &euro;5 million for firms in the food sector and &euro;3 million for firms in the non-food sector; and a &euro;5 million micro-enterprise emergency Brexit fund which will be operated by the local enterprise offices in the form of repayable grants of up to &euro;50,000.  In addition, Microfinance Ireland will receive an extra &euro;5 million to increase the loan ceiling from &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000.  An extra &euro;3 million will be available for the Department's regulatory bodies for additional demands in market surveillance, accreditation and conformity.  An additional &euro;2 million will be provided to InterTradeIreland.<\/p><p> Ever since the Brexit referendum, my Department has regularly engaged with stakeholders.  I regularly chair meetings of my Department's enterprise forum on Brexit and global challenges, which includes representatives from business and trade representation groups.  I also chair meetings of the retail consultation forum.  Through regular meetings of this forum, I have been able, with my enterprise agencies, to develop a wide array of supports to help businesses to prepare for Brexit.  I have also chaired a number of round-table discussions with the main retail, grocery and distribution players to better understand contingency planning within that sector.  Throughout 2017 and 2018, my Department held a series of stakeholder events on Brexit countrywide, focusing on my Department's policy areas.  From July to September 2019, I hosted four Brexit outreach events in the Border region in partnership with the accountancy bodies of Ireland, the agencies of my Department, Revenue and InterTradeIreland.  These events took place in County Donegal, where stakeholders from counties Leitrim and Sligo were invited; County Cavan; County Louth, where stakeholders from County Meath were invited; and County Monaghan.  At these events I impressed on businesses the need to act quickly on a no-regrets planning basis across a range of actions, from supply chain management to customs procedures.  I have also participated in panel discussions at other fora such as the National Ploughing Championships.  Furthermore, I instructed my officials last September to email more than 220,000 companies on the register of the Companies Registration Office to encourage them to act now to prepare for Brexit.  The enterprise and regulatory agencies of my Department have been highly proactive in their own right driving home their sector-specific messages.  They have organised workshops, roadshows and stakeholder events nationwide as well as conducting national media campaigns to make businesses aware of the need for action in distinct sectors.  Members may be familiar with, for instance, the radio advertisements currently running on the need for businesses to be aware of the changes in online retail business post Brexit.<\/p><p> In February 2018, my Department published the Copenhagen Economics study which examined the strategic implications arising for Ireland from changing EU-UK trading relations.  The study examined the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade and quantified the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit.  While all the scenarios examined in the study produced a result that was less favourable than a no-Brexit scenario, the economy is still expected to record strong, positive growth in the period to 2030.  The report also highlighted a range of employment challenges in vulnerable agricultural and traditional manufacturing sectors and the disproportionate impact of Brexit on the regions.  This analysis was conducted on the basis of no policy change, that is, of no mitigation measures being taken by Government or firms.  In reality, extensive work and mitigation actions to prepare for the UK's exit, including a hard Brexit, have been undertaken by Government.<\/p><p> In my everyday engagement with businesses, as well as through the more formal channels of engagement referred to earlier, I know that businesses harbour a number of concerns.  The area of new customs procedures on east-west trade, as well as checks and other controls on agricultural products, is of concern.  Customs is an area that Irish businesses have not, in the main, needed to be overly concerned about but post Brexit, with the UK as a third country, that will no longer be the case.  The Government has responded to the dearth in capacity of customs clearance agents by introducing Clear Customs, a specific initiative that combines training through Skillnet Ireland and financial assistance for recruitment, software, etc., through Enterprise Ireland.  Concerns have also been raised about the ability at the ports of Dublin and Rosslare to manage extra capacity, including additional delays that could arise due to additional customs and phytosanitary checks.  Again, the Government has invested heavily in additional infrastructure to handle additional traffic, including minimising the risk of delays.  Importers and exporters need to be prepared for new customs and other agrifood controls to facilitate smooth running at the ports.  I am also aware that businesses have been closely examining supply chain issues and that many have used the opportunity to diversify into other markets and to source product from other EU countries.<\/p><p> While the manner in which the UK will leave the EU remains uncertain, members can be assured that the Government is continuing to prepare for all scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit.  The Government is fully aware of the vital importance of providing targeted measures to help those businesses that would be most affected by a no-deal Brexit.  Budget 2020 is prudently framed and sets out a further range of measures designed to assist businesses, particularly indigenous businesses, that would be vulnerable but viable in a no-deal Brexit.  As I said, given recent developments, a no-deal Brexit is looking less likely.  However, until we have absolutely certainty, we must continue to prepare on the basis of such an outcome.  My firm hope, which I am sure is shared by members of the committee, is that the agreement endorsed by the European Council last week will be agreed.  We await the outcome of developments in Westminster in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019102300002#D00300","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>Before I open discussion to the floor, I will put a question to the Minister.

This is a big shock to both areas and, most importantly, a huge shock to the workers and their families.  Our thoughts and concerns are with them.  All the supports of the State will be made available to the workers to help them to upskill or reskill and to ensure they get job opportunities in other areas.  In the meantime, IDA Ireland will continue to promote the Shannon area as a very attractive place in which to do business.  What we have in Shannon is a pool of talented people who will not have employment or work in Molex at the end of 2020.  We will actively promote the area because one of the most valuable resources such areas have is a pool of talented people.  There is confidence that there will be opportunities in other companies in the region.  Nevertheless, this is a big shock and on a human level the workers and their families have a lot to take in over the coming days.<\/p> <p>  We always look at international economic and trade developments together with our enterprise agencies and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through its embassy network, with a view to assessing how this will impact on the enterprise environment here.  We all know that Ireland is a highly open, export-orientated economy operating in an intensely competitive global marketplace.  This means that decisions taken by firms abroad as well as international developments can sometimes impact on their operations here.  We cannot take foreign direct investment for granted - that much is clear.  The past five years have seen record numbers of jobs created by overseas firms here but, unfortunately, jobs can also be lost, as this week has regrettably demonstrated.  We should also remember that these announcements are not a reflection of the overall strength or competitiveness of our economy.  I emphasise too that the developments this week are in no way connected to Brexit, concerns about the international trading environment or any loss of confidence in the Irish or European economies.  The developments simply follow specific restructuring and strategic decisions taken by overseas firms.<\/p><p>In the case of Molex, I spoke to the chief executive officer at lunchtime yesterday.  He told me that this was a reluctantly made decision and was in no way a reflection on the company&rsquo;s wonderful workers in Shannon.  It was started there in 1971 and the company regretted having to make the decision.  However, 75% of what is manufactured there are end-of-life products and not required any more.  This decision was made at a company board meeting in Chicago.  It has two other plants, one in Sligo and one in Letterkenny, County Donegal.  The chief executive officer assured me that it was business as usual with these sites and that it wanted to continue to have strong links with Ireland.  IDA Ireland will continue to work with Molex to see if there are other opportunities where new products might come online.<\/p><p> The same applies to the Novartis plant at Ringaskiddy, County Cork.  IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with it to see if there are further opportunities for investment there.  The Novartis plant will lose 60 jobs next year and then the losses scale up to 2023.<\/p><p> It is not nice for workers to hear this news.  However, there is very much a unified approach from the State agencies, the training and university bodies, as well as the local authorities, to these announcements.  It is about how everybody can work together.  A core group of the key stakeholders will be set up underneath the regional enterprise development plan committee.  It will work to deal with the issue of jobs losses and see what opportunities we can secure for the areas in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019102300002#E00300","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>The new proposal replacing the backstop will effectively see a border down the Irish Sea.

All our thoughts are with the workers affected.  Was there any early warning about these announcements?  Previously there used to be an early warning system in the Department for potential job losses.  Will the Minister confirm if that early warning system still exists?  If so, why did it not work on this occasion?

We were not aware of these before this.<\/p> <p>  IDA Ireland works closely with both of these companies.  Sometimes, however, commercial decisions are made at a board level in a different country.  These companies do not always say what they are doing because the information may be commercially sensitive.  We did not have notification of these announcements but we have quickly responded.  That is why all State supports have been put at the disposal of the regions in question.  We will ensure we get investment into these areas to replace the jobs lost.<\/p> <p>  On the backstop and the new proposal, the deal reached between the EU and the UK negotiating teams differs from the previous withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationship in four ways.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland will now be a permanent arrangement for Northern Ireland rather than a backstop or an insurance policy.  It is no longer temporary.  However, the protocol can still be replaced, in whole or part, by a subsequent EU-UK future relationship agreement.  The customs and VAT provisions in the protocol have substantially changed with the removal of the EU-UK single customs territory.  Instead, this has been replaced with arrangements which will see Northern Ireland remain part of the UK customs territory.  Northern Ireland will, therefore, stand to benefit from future UK trade deals, although it will continue to apply the rules of the EU customs code.  Products entering the island of Ireland will undergo necessary regulatory and customs checks.  The details of how this will work in practice are to be decided by the joint committee during the transition period.<\/p> <p>  The review clause, or Article 20, of the current protocol has been removed and replaced by Article 18, providing for democratic consent in Northern Ireland.  This will enable the Northern Ireland Assembly to agree by a simple majority four years from the end of the transition period if it wishes to remain in customs and regulatory alignment.  If a simple majority decides to remain, a vote will be held every four years.  If the decision is made by the majority of both communities, the subsequent vote will not take place for a further eight years.<\/p> <p>  The bottom line is that there will be no border between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland.  That is important, especially if one lives where I live.

We have worked with businesses and developed a wide range of supports.  Enterprise Ireland has developed a customs insights course.  It is a 45-minute online course which is available to all businesses and the aim of it is to give companies a good understanding of the key customs concepts and the documentation and processes required to succeed post Brexit.  Enterprise Ireland also has its Brexit: Act On Initiative, which helps eligible companies develop an action plan for Brexit, focusing on a range of areas including customs and logistics.  The local enterprise offices are currently running one-day customs workshops.  A total of 1,863 people have taken up the customs insight course and more than 200 have applied for the clear customs training which is an intensive course.  I visited an office in Cavan which was rolling out that course and there were ten people there that day.  That course relates to intensive customs clearance that a company should know about if it is doing a lot of business in the UK.  That is being rolled out.  Businesses are taking up these kinds of supports.  There is no doubt about that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned state aid rules.  I met Margrethe Vestager, Vice President designate of the EU Commission, earlier this year.  She assured me that the Commission stands ready to act and that state aid rules will not act as a barrier to supporting vulnerable but viable firms.  She has put a dedicated team in place to support Ireland and my officials work very closely with her officials on what is needed.  I am satisfied that she has clearly said to me that the Commission stands ready to act urgently to mitigate the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.

Many small businesses did not attend the briefings but they would have loved to have done.  With one or two employees, and working seven days a week, they said to me that they cannot prepare for something that may not happen.  When it kicks in, the Minister will find them knocking at her door.  By the nature of their business, it is a day-to-day struggle.<\/p> <p>  The risk of a hard Brexit has decreased but it remains.  She stated that she is still in day-to-day preparation.  She mentioned Dublin Port, in particular, and the impact on traffic.  Have the delay scenarios in Dublin Port been played out and the impact that that would have on the M50?  The M50 is like a vein of the city.  If that clogs up, it clogs up the business of the city.<\/p><p>A rainy day in Dublin is bad enough.  A bad day in Dublin Port in the case of a hard Brexit could be disastrous.  Have we rehearsed that scenario and the impact it would have?  Have we put an extra 300 trucks on the M50 at 11 a.m. rather than at 7 a.m. as is usual?<\/p><p> What is the position regarding the delivery of permanent custom controls at Rosslare Europort?  Is it intended to slow this matter down or speed it up?  I have heard representations from the car industry on the importation of cars into Ireland and the potential impact of Brexit on this particular industry.  Let us suppose that agreement is reached in Stormont and the current agreement comes into effect.  Suppose then that a second-hand diesel car is imported into Northern Ireland and then sold, with the trader saying that the intention is not to sell it into the South.  What will happen if the car is then sold into the South?  That situation could apply to an awful lot of Ireland's imports.  I am concerned about how small business people can compete if products can be brought from the UK through Northern Ireland and sold on in the South.  I know the agreement calls for goods to be designated as staying in Northern Ireland, but how can the destination be controlled with an open border?  My neighbour can buy a diesel car in Northern Ireland and re-register it in two months, or buy a product in Northern Ireland and bring it back here.  It may have no registration, but different VAT controls and costs will apply.  How will these businesses be protected?<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for their time.

With the exception of the DUP, the people of Ireland, North and South, have stood together.  Civil society, businesses, farming organisations and political parties on the island of Ireland have stood together with one clear message.  A decision made predominantly by English people cannot impact on the Good Friday Agreement.  There can be no hard border on the island of Ireland, and in line with the Good Friday agreement, a solution must be based on the consent of the majority of people of the North of Ireland.  That was the litmus test.  These were the areas in which we had to stand together and defend Irish interests.<\/p> <p>  A point has been made about the backstop.  The backstop was a compromise.  It was the very least that we could accept.  It protected all of the concerns I have just outlined.  Deputy Chambers has stated that what has been negotiated is worse.  She gave a very negative assessment and made negative predictions of what will happen in four years.  That is the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement states that the majority of the people of the North of Ireland decide the future of the North of Ireland.  There was an attempt by the DUP to turn that into a veto for a section of unionism.  That has been rejected, which is fair and consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement that has been negotiated protects Irish interests on a range of levels.  It is churlish and wrong to pick apart votes that will take place in four years.  As I say, an eye was on the next general election while questions were put to undermine the hard work put in by the Irish Government, supported by all the political parties in Ireland, with the exception of the DUP, and our colleagues in Europe.  It is important to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  However, the agreement is not perfect and I will now mention some questions and challenges.

I thank the Chairperson for her patience.<\/p><p>As the Minister may know, the committee has received several submissions which are assisting us in our work.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce raises concerns in its submission that small traders are \"ill-equipped\" to deal with a \"significant increase\" in import-export declarations.  The chamber is particularly concerned that smaller freight and haulage companies \"do not have the required customs expertise to adhere to these potential new obligations\".  Will the Minister address those concerns?<\/p><p> In the budget for 2020, the Minister for Finance set aside &euro;1.2 billion for a Brexit support fund.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has outlined some of the specifics of that funding today.  Like me, the Minister is from a Border constituency where tourism and retail businesses, in particular, are feeling the hit from the uncertainty around Brexit, including currency fluctuations and the reduction in British tourist numbers.  There is a real sense of crisis and urgency in the tourism sector in my county, despite the excellent work that has been done around the Wild Atlantic Way and other positive efforts to promote the area.  Whether a deal is passed by Westminster or there is a no-deal scenario, does the Minister have any plans to release funding to assist struggling sectors right now?<\/p><p> We received a submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which points out that the unions are not included in the Minister's trade and investment stakeholder group.  Is this something she might consider correcting?  We talk a great deal about preparing businesses for the challenges of Brexit but we must also prepare workers, who are facing upskilling and diversification challenges.  ICTU is very much a relevant stakeholder in that regard and its submission asks that it be included in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019102300002#J02200","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  We have a range of supports to help small traders to deal with any new customs arrangements.  I acknowledge their concerns and worries.  The first thing we encouraged everybody to do was to register for an economic operators registration and identification, EORI, number with Revenue.  Without that, one cannot do anything.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, have been rolling out training schemes to assist small businesses.  If any trader is concerned or worried, the first port of call should be the LEO, where he or she will receive information and direction.  If traders need more in-depth training on customs procedures, they can access the Clear Customs initiative which is being rolled out in conjunction with Skillnet Ireland.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has an online facility which provides the information businesses need regarding Brexit.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that Brexit will impact the tourism sector.  An allocation of &euro;7 million is included in this year's budget and &euro;40 million in the 2020 budget to support the industry.  That funding is available through F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Senator makes a good point regarding ICTU and the need to support workers as well as businesses.  We are very conscious of that.  I have met with representatives of ICTU as part of our consultations regarding Brexit.  I have also met with the Department of Employment and Social Protection, which will fully resource a short-term work support scheme to provide an opportunity for employers to retain skilled labour in a reduced capacity and avoid permanent lay-offs and associated redundancy costs.  This will be particularly beneficial to retailers who may be impacted by cross-Border shopping in a sterling depreciation scenario and to businesses in the tourism, hospitality and fishing sectors.  Food and engineering sub-suppliers may also need to go on a reduced working day.  The scheme will provide a subsidy that allows workers' wages to be maintained and enables them to use the time they are not working to reskill or upskill via training programmes.  There are other areas of the economy where we do need people.  In addition, the National Training Fund is being further supplemented in budget 2020, which, coupled with the new flexibilities in training services, will ensure tailored training and upskilling for workers can be deployed.  It is important that we have this suite of supports for workers as well as businesses.  Having also met with representatives of Ibec, my position is that we must work together to deal with any difficult situations that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019102300002#K00200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome the Minister once again.

In the short time available to us, we aim to highlight the nature and extent of one specific form of online harassment, namely image-based sexual abuse.

We present these submissions in memory of Dara Quigley and in consultation with her mother, Aileen Malone, who is present in the Gallery.<\/p><p> Dara Quigley was an Irish activist and journalist.  In 2017, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forcibly detained Ms Quigley under Ireland's Mental Health Act for walking naked in a Dublin street.  State CCTV cameras captured Ms Quigley's images.  Media reports tell us that a garda was suspected of recording the images.  The images were shared on a WhatsApp message group and, subsequently, posted on Facebook.  The images were reported to have been shared 125,000 times before being taken down.  Several days later, Dara Quigley committed suicide.  Two and a half years later, no organisation or individual has been held responsible for their role in the abuse of Ms Quigley.  Dara's mother has supported our discussing this case today to lend a personal perspective regarding, as she says, \"how devastating online sexual harassment and public humiliation can be\".<\/p><p> Today, the committee is considering responses to what it terms \"revenge porn\".  ICCL objects to \"revenge porn\" as a term.  It is not pornography; it is sexual abuse.  Revenge is only one of myriad motivations that, principally, are to violate a person's dignity and his or her autonomy.<\/p><p> \"Image-based sexual abuse\" is a term coined by UK academics to better describe the non-consensual nature of this problem either by creating or distributing private sexual images.  Image-based sexual abuse is a gendered problem with established harms.  Our research shows that while anyone can be a victim, the majority are women and the majority of perpetrators are men.   This is not to say that intersectional factors also influence the likelihood of experiencing online harassment.  Generally, the LGBT+ community is at increased risk.  One's race, religion, ethnicity, mental health and ability are all risk factors.  The harms have been well described by others, numerous academics and in our submissions.  I ask the members to please let me know if they want me to elaborate during questions.<\/p><p> The image-based sexual abuse of Ms Quigley illustrates weaknesses in the Irish regime for responding.  We have proposed several solutions in our submissions and we will focus on three solutions here.  <\/p><p> A first step for tackling this problem is updated and robust laws.  This has been outlined well by the Law Reform Commission, LRC.  ICCL specifically calls for the criminalisation of image-based sexual abuse.  This is might be an amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to outlaw the creation and-or sharing of private sexual images.  ICCL also supports the creation of a civil wrong together with legal aid access to ensure restitution and compensation.  However, as ICCL has previously stated in its submissions on harmful content moderation, and in our review of the recent Harmful Communications and Digital Safety Bill 2017, \"harmful content\" must be clearly defined.  As has been said well here to the committee, a lack of specificity will not meet legality standards and could lead to infringement of other rights, including expression. <\/p><p> Second, strong laws also require strong enforcement practices and we cannot have enforcement without a cultural understanding of this problem at garda&iacute; level.  The committee has heard stories here of people not receiving adequate assistance from garda&iacute; on online harassment issues.  Dara's treatment was far more egregious.  In our submissions we, therefore, present a number of suggestions for the Garda in line with our other ICCL publications to ground Garda practices in the principals of human rights.  Specifically, the integration of training and assessment regarding the gendered and otherwise intersexual nature of online harassment, including image-based sexual abuse intersectional.  It is enough to focus on cyberbullying, a terms that erases the context of power and marginalisation in which injustice against people such as Dara has occurred. <\/p><p> Third, the ICCL is opposed, in principal, to the Department Justice and Equality's community-based CCTV programme.  We recommend that the State does not further contribute to online harassment by building up the web of tech surveillance to which we are all, increasingly, subject.  Installing CCTV to maintain public safety is based on flawed logic.  Blanket surveillance does not help us; it harms us, which Dara's experience has certainly demonstrated and it harms some of us more than others.  There is significant research that suggests CCTV does not effectively deter crime to sufficiently mitigate the impact on our privacy.  Policing tech can also be very discriminatory.  In Dara Quigley's case, CCTV has become a mechanism for gendered online harassment and her experience of image-based sexual abuse.  We need to rethink this wrong-headed approach to expanding surveillance simply because the technical means exist together with over-policing segments of the population in Ireland.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Dara Quigley's experience is an appalling one and it is ongoing for her family.  We are conscious that investigations have been initiated into Dara's death and egregious treatment of her by, as yet not formally identified, perpetrators.<\/p><p>However, two and half years later, these investigations have not provided any justice to Dara or her family.  The aim of our submission today is to highlight the tragic consequences of violations of rights in this area and solutions in order to prevent such cases occurring in future.  At the same time, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties will continue to support Dara's family in the struggle for justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Farries","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick and Ms Farries.

We provide free, reliable, non-judgmental information services to more than 150,000 young people in Ireland each month.  At the core of what we do is a mission to reach our peers where they are, which is online.  Consequently, we have developed a real and practical understanding of the realities of youth engagement on the Internet.  It is important in any debate that touches these issues to consider both the challenges of better digital citizenship and the great capacity for good that exists in an open and accessible Internet.  Too often we find ourselves talking about &quot;online safety&quot;, by which we mainly mean restricting the capacity of bad actors to do harm but that kind of framing does not always recognise the ways in which online services can also enhance the safety and well-being of young people or the rights of children, enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to association, education, participation, expression and information.  That is whether it comes through online mental health services access to a supportive community for the otherwise isolated or the kind of information on sexuality, health, employment or education that so many thousands of young people access every day online.<br\/><br\/>Our focus needs to be on preserving the possibility and promise of an open Internet while being clear about those areas where there can be no substitute for smart and effective regulation.  SpunOut has a long history of engagement with the service providers that dominate young people's experiences online.  We have worked for a number of years with Twitter&rsquo;s global trust and safety council and as part of Facebook&rsquo;s suicide and self-injury advisory committee.  Where we can work with and influence the big platforms in the technology space we have done so and we have seen results.  Our partnership with Facebook and our colleagues here from the DCU anti-bullying centre, for example, has helped train and resource young people and teachers in the area of better digital citizenship.<br\/><br\/>We can tell the committee, from experience, that possibilities exist in platforms and civil society groups like SpunOut, working together, to voluntarily improve the online space.  That experience has also taught us what are the limits.  It has taught us that, for all the platforms can do to try to improve their impact on the world, there are areas in which there is simply no substitute for intervention and regulation by the State.  We come across the limits of not intervening, particularly with a platform like Snapchat.  It is incredibly popular with young people, offering a service based on the promise that all messages being sent are private and temporary.  However, Snapchat is domiciled outside of the European Union and routinely makes no effort to engage with non-governmental organisations on issues of privacy, transparency and safety of young people on the platform.  Like any private company, the main goal is to maximise shareholder value and, like any non-profit, organisations such as ours can only involve ourselves as far as our limited budgets will stretch.<br\/><br\/>Government has a role that is inescapable in this as the only democratically mandated force within our society with the authority, ability and resources to intervene and tilt the balance from multinational global corporations back towards the individuals and communities that use our shared online space.  We need to start reshaping how we view the relationship between us as service users and the companies that shape our online experiences.  The nature of these companies' business models is simply not properly understood within our current laws.  There is an assumption, for example, that when I set up a profile with Snapchat or another online platform, it is fundamentally and legally a relationship of equals and that the pages of terms and conditions I probably sign without reading, much less understanding, somehow mean I am fully informed of every way in which my data might then be used.  This is a legal illusion we need to break.  The reality is when we deal with an entity of that size, influence and power, it is a relationship not between an ordinary customer and a regular provider of services; it is a relationship in which we are at a profound information disadvantage.<br\/><br\/>The answer to how we manage those relationships better is by accepting first and foremost that when we access a service, such as a doctor or solicitor, where their level of knowledge so outstrips the client, and where the client relies on the provider not just to provide a service but also to do so in a client's own best interest.  Those services must have a legal responsibility to a client above and beyond their obligation to turn a profit.<\/p><p>The answer is accountability.  We do not necessarily need a Hippocratic oath for Snapchat or TikTok but we need the Government to recognise and enforce the accountability these services owe us for the disproportionate influence they have over our lives.<\/p><p> What does that level of accountability look like in practice?  As a country, we have surely learned that regulations can only be as effective as the regulator.  That is why we need a powerful and independent digital safety commissioner as we have outlined in our submission to this committee.  That commissioner needs to be empowered by legislative change, specifically new laws that clearly define online harassment and hate speech and that make it an offence to share intimate images without consent, regardless of the platform used.  Our current laws in this regard are largely from a predigital age and are long overdue an update.<\/p><p> So too is our conception of privacy.  The idea that we have an exclusive right to our personal data is under relentless challenge by companies for whom mass data profiling is the model for doing business.  Whereas the general data protection regulation has gone some way towards validating our individual rights in this area, it is still simply untrue to assume a multinational organisation with a legal department and an individual consumer are somehow operating on an equal playing field.  Our right to privacy, like so much else, is only meaningful when we can be confident it is underwritten by a State system that is willing to wade in and defend it actively rather than just telling us our rights and expecting that we enforce them ourselves.  It is no use just guaranteeing rights in theory.  The digital safety commissioner will need a framework that lets it receive and respond to reports as quickly and effectively as possible.<\/p><p> If we are waiting for young people to call into the Garda to report that they are being bullied or harassed, we may be waiting a very long time.  A single, clearly advertised central point of contact by text or online is far more likely to encourage young people who have been wronged online to come forward and report what has happened.  They will also need to know that their complaints will not just gather dust.  The Garda must be funded to deal with these reports in a timely way.  We have had very positive experiences with cases brought to the child exploitation unit recently and I hope that ethos can be applied just as well to young people aged 18 and over too.<\/p><p> The question of funding really gets to the heart of this.  From what I can see there is widespread support in the Oireachtas for the Government taking a bigger role in this area.  Without meaningful resourcing and hard money behind the project, no new regulator, legal change or Garda unit will be able to make much headway.  That is why we are calling for a minimum budget of &euro;10 million on day one of the online safety commissioner taking office, if necessary funded by an industrial revenue-based levy on many highly profitable online multinationals that have chosen to make this country their base of operations.  Accountability needs to be a watchword for all of us in this, including the Government, non-governmental organisations and service providers.  Until we have a firm commitment to the resources we will need in creating a safer Internet, we will not be holding ourselves accountable to the millions of people, young and old, who deserve a better, more secure, more responsible online space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to come today.  I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody and Dr. Tijana Milosevic, researchers with international experience working at the anti-bullying centre, ABC, in DCU.  The national anti-bullying research and resource centre is a university-designated research centre that brings together not just researchers from across DCU but across colleges in Ireland and abroad.  The centre receives public and private funding, which allows us to undertake research and develop resources into issues relating to bullying and online safety.  There are currently 20 researchers based at the centre and researchers at the centre were the first in Ireland to undertake research on school bullying, cyberbullying, workplace bullying, homophobic bullying, sibling bullying and \"sexting\" relating to mental health and well-being with young people.  The centre currently delivers a whole school, community anti-bullying and online safety programme to post-primary schools in Ireland and it is available for free to those schools.  The programme, called FUSE, focuses on bridging the gap that often exists between parents, teachers and students in tackling bullying and promoting online safety.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee have already received our full submission so I will highlight in summary three areas we hope will be helpful to the committee in determining what laws and regulations are appropriate for dealing with online harassment and related matters.  With legislation, we support the move to increase oversight of social media and related platforms and the level of this oversight is ultimately a decision for the Government to determine.  We recommend that consideration be given to the experiences in other countries where hastily introduced regulations have been ultimately found not to work as originally intended.  Legislation should be informed by sound research, including the voices of young people.<\/p><p>We welcome the recent announcement by the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, NACOS, that it is commissioning national research that will provide insights to those seeking to develop legislation and guidelines on online harassment.<\/p><p> We encourage the committee to take into account a range of platforms on which cyberbullying may occur and not just a handful of large social media companies.  Our research shows that children and young people are equally likely to be bullied or have negative experiences on gaming platforms, for example, as well as content-sharing apps, friending apps, and artificial intelligence platforms and chatbots.  The established social media companies tend to have more developed resources to address various online harms that may not always be available to the various start-ups, which spring up quickly and accumulate significant numbers of young users.  We are by no means suggesting that the big companies should evade scrutiny, merely that a range of platforms should be taken into consideration when designing legislation while being mindful of the need to protect innovation and freedom of expression.  Incentivising safety by design might be one approach to addressing this issue.<\/p><p> Regarding support, cyberbullying is not merely an online safety issue but is also a behavioural problem.  Therefore, removing content alone may not solve the conflict, which can continue on other platforms or offline.  Any legislation that only or predominantly focuses on content removal might miss the opportunity to address the problem at a level beyond merely addressing its symptoms.  Legislation should also focus on providing funding for support to those who have been victimised online.  Often the removal of content is only the first step in a process of overcoming trauma related to online harassment, and further counselling and support may be required.  This could include funding for psychological counselling services available to children involved in cyberbullying both as bullies and as victims.  This could also entail the provision of funding for helpline services which offer counselling and educational support to prevent future incidents reoccurring.<\/p><p> Regarding prevention, cyberbullying by children and teenagers often relates to a lack of understanding and appreciation of the effects their actions and words might have on other children or teenagers whom they target.  We have found in research that the provision of education related to online safety, tolerance, kindness, diversity and inclusion can go a long way to reducing the level of bullying and cyberbullying.  Securing funding for educational measures aimed at prevention could also be considered.  Specifically, there is a need to create a national standardised cyberbullying or online safety prevention and intervention curriculum, which could include online safety instruction and which would be deployed not just in schools but also in sports clubs, youth clubs, online training for young people who use the Internet, advertisements, marketing and engagement with parents and so on throughout the country.  This could also constitute a way forward in promoting online safety among young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>Finally, I call the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.

We are very grateful to the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to speak on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  I am here with my colleague, Ms Shirley Scott.  We have already made a submission to the committee answering the various questions it raised.<\/p> <p>  Our interest in this topic arises from the range of services we offer.  We take more than 270 calls each week on the national 24-hour helpline we run.  We provide face-to-face therapy to nearly 600 people and training to approximately 2,000 people per year, including those working on the front line with victims and survivors of sexual violence and those working with children and young people.  Our personnel accompany victims and survivors to the sexual assault treatment unit at the Rotunda Hospital, to Garda stations and to court.<\/p> <p>  In our work we see the often lifelong consequences of the trauma and harm caused by sexual violence of all kinds, which is often compounded for victims and survivors as a result of technology and harmful communications that are used to harass and humiliate.  In our BodyRight programme, developed to raise awareness of sexual violence among young people and to assist in its prevention, we have recently had to introduce additional modules to address what their teachers and guidance counsellors found as the serious issues of sexting and sextortion, and we are developing a module on pornography.  As everybody has said, while the sharing of images might appear harmless to some people, particularly young people, sexting and other forms of image sharing can have serious social and legal consequences, and the importance of young people knowing about those consequences cannot be overestimated.<\/p><p>We hear all the time from callers and clients of how a single image uploaded to the Internet without consent can often have devastating consequences for the person whose image is uploaded.<\/p><p> We also prefer the term preferred by the committee of \"non-consensual sharing of sexual images\".  This type of abuse, the sharing of images online without consent, is often done by partners and ex-partners and is one of the deepest betrayals of trust by a partner or ex-partner, who is using technology and the Internet to cause harm.  We need legislation to better protect everyone together with a greater understanding of the harmful and insidious nature of such abuse.<\/p><p> Such forms of non-consensual sharing of intimate images are recognised as specific offences in other jurisdictions.  We have expanded on this in our written submission.  In brief, many jurisdictions have laws in place to protect people from online sexual violence.  The offences introduced in Australia, New Zealand, England and Wales targeting online harassment and harmful communications focus on both the behaviour and the impact of the behaviour, which is an approach we recommend.<\/p><p> We also recommend that harmful content be defined as any content that seriously interferes with the peace and privacy of the other person or which causes alarm, distress or harm to him or her.  Freedom of expression, while an important right, is not an absolute one and must be balanced against the impact of the online harmful communication and privacy rights.  Our criminal legislation on the issue is at present entirely inadequate to address issues of harassment, stalking, voyeurism or other harmful online behaviour and does not protect the rights of those who are victims of such behaviour.  If the definition of harmful content were broadened, there would be a more balanced approach that would not impose undue restrictions on the right of freedom of expression, which only requires the removal of content where the content is injurious to the victim.  We do not have legislation creating any statutory responsibility for Internet service providers to monitor effectively content being posted on their websites.<\/p><p> In our written submission to the committee we have recommended a flexible approach whereby the legislation would be supported by the capacity of a digital safety commissioner to regulate content within the main mandate of the legislation.  The commissioner would have mandatory powers to implement legislation and capacity to build codes of practice and to issue notices or other takedown sanctions if the need arose.  Based on the data and research of that office, rules could be adjusted to ensure that the legislation remains effective and current.  We also believe there would be a substantial increase in safety, a reduction in crime and much more responsibility online if every account had a verified author.  This is not the current model for online companies anywhere but it would be a substantial safeguard against criminal behaviour and activity, such as that which happens on online dating sites, defamation, which happens with trolls and fake accounts across social media, and irresponsible posting.  Companies would be responsible for verifying.  Posters and authors would be responsible for their defamation or their criminal activity and harmful communications.  This should be universal but could at least be Ireland and Europe-wide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Blackwell and all our other contributors.

The term \"non-consensual sharing of sexual images\" does not capture the lack of consent involved when the images are created in the first instance.  It deals with the sharing aspect only.  Many cases, including that of Dara Quigley, have been identified in which images were created without a person's consent.  We need to be very clear about our terminology to ensure we draft effective solutions.

From our perspective, such services are overwhelmingly used by young people.  There needs to be an onus on such platforms to engage in proactive measures, such as hashing of images that have been shared, to prevent their resharing.  When we think about closed and encrypted spaces, we appreciate that encryption is set to proliferate further across all platforms.  The first point we would make from our perspective is that this approach can only work in circumstances in which platforms become responsible when they are notified.  We have seen a number of cases in which a significant takedown response has not been initiated by the platforms even though they have been notified.  Such cases have been escalated to us.  I know we are talking about the harmful communications Bill, but it cannot be divorced from the proposal to establish an office of digital safety commissioner.  There must be a place within the State where citizens can go to seek the takedown of a piece of content that has not been responded to by a platform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1214,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Power that there should be a statutory body, such as an online safety commissioner, to which a complainant can go without having to go through the hassle of going to court and getting lawyers to make his or her case.

Vaguely defined terms such as this may include illegal content but it might also capture users' behaviours that are deemed harmful but not illegal and not sufficient to take down.  This, therefore, would have the effect of censoring speech and certain associated rights attached to that.<\/p> <p>  The UK Online Harms White Paper has introduced duty of care but that has been robustly criticised by qualified rights advocates.  Duty of care imposed on social media platforms, combined with heavy fines, creates incentives for platform companies to block online content, even if its illlegality is doubtful and even if it serves to further conversations about online abuse.<\/p><p>We have seen content moderation by social media companies.  Please forgive me, they are actively engaged.  They are not unengaged in this scenario.  We have seen them get it wrong repeatedly.  Women of colour complaining online about their experience of racist harassment will be censored.  That should not be censored.  We need to make sure that we do not incentivise the removal of speech to protect certain interest groups.<\/p><p> I refer to this dangerous proposition about user verification.  We do not support such proposals.  The ICCL is part of an international network of civil liberties organisations.  My colleagues in the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights have talked about an activist who was imprisoned, egregiously, for simply calling on people to gather and speak against their experiences of harm.  In 2013, Alaa Abdel Fattah was violently arrested for talking about issues on Facebook and Twitter and he was only released last March.  The idea that people would be unable to speak out anonymously about their experiences of harm in areas where autocratic regimes erode civil rights is a problem.  That is something we absolutely need to protect not just gender considerations but intersectional considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#P02900","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Farries","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1243,"content":"<p>It might seem superficially that one might propose a safe area such as the EU where problems like that do not arise but that is not the case either.

There is a superficial appeal to this idea of verification but it is deeply problematic in practice.  The Deputy compared expression online to driving a car on a road.  His analogy is problematic because one can also use the analogy of online expression in terms of expression more generally.  We do not require licences for people to be politically active, express themselves, protest or write letters to newspapers and so on.  This goes to the heart of the question about harmful content and, again, the analogy that was helpfully introduced by the Deputy, about expression that might cause distress to a politician.  We have a carefully crafted balance of freedom of expression within the Council of Europe area under the European Convention on Human Rights and, indeed, under the Constitution.  Once one starts getting into the concept of what might cause distress to others, in terms of being harmful, that is not amenable to a proportionate legal definition.  That is the problem we are likely to encounter if we go down this road.  It is not at all to understate the challenge of finding the right ways to deal with things that undoubtedly cause injury to people.

That is made more difficult by encryption and other such things that are, in our mind, proportionate.  The proportion of harms versus the normal day-to-day activities of citizens is small.

I would like to tease that out.  One of the things I am interested in is the platforms and their liability in this area.  While there may be difficulty in finding the person because of anonymity, even when he or she is found, all one can do at the moment is ask the platforms to take it down.  The platforms can take down the offensive images or comments but often they do not.  There can be a fight to make sure that happens and the individual feels he or she is very much David against Goliath.  Should Goliath be more responsible for the situation?  Should there be some way of ensuring that the platform is liable and should there be a sanction against it if it does not act within an appropriate timeframe?

That was the focus of my research so it involved the tools these companies already have.  I am not a legal scholar so I do not feel competent to speak on the issue of liability.  I understand both sides in terms of freedom of expression and innovation on the one hand and the need to protect on the other.  It is extremely important for victims to have a streamlined way of communicating what has happened and an effective way to take down content that has harmed them in some way.  It can be difficult for companies to do that for various reasons.  Very often, even if the poster is anonymous, the problem is not just with him or her.  Content spreads easily and is very easily shared so the problem becomes a cultural problem.<\/p> <p>  I will give a perfect example of this.  I have studied the cases of children who have died by suicide in different countries.  This happened because their intimate images were shared online without their consent, for example, through predators.  What really got to them and in a way brought about that tragic outcome was the bullying from their peers that took place afterwards, so it was not about the poster and taking down that one piece of content or even punishing the poster.  It was about the wider culture of bullying.  It is important to take the content down and point out that this form of abuse is not okay, particularly when someone is a young person, but it is not enough.  Of course, companies should be responsible but regulating their liability is a very difficult question.<\/p><p> In respect of the proposal for a digital services Act in the European Commission and the e-commerce directive, it is a very difficult question that legal scholars must address.  This committee should bear in mind that taking down this content is really not enough.  It is very important to know that even if we incentivise the companies by proposing fines, which is one aspect of what the Australian eSafety Commissioner is doing, it is not enough of a solution.<\/p><p> It is also very important that we need to evaluate continually what the companies are already doing.  If they say they have an effective reporting mechanism, there needs to be a way to determine through independent research how effective that is from the perspective of victims, particularly if the victims are young people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tijana Milosevic","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>Regarding the point that the reach of this is broader and we should consider preventative measures in considering this issue, the key thing for us is to reframe it from online safety, which is all about protecting oneself and where the onus is on the victim or potential victim to make sure he or she is protecting himself or herself, to general digital citizenship, which is about ensuring that all citizens make sure they are behaving in a way that is within the law and is not harmful to other online users.  From our perspective, we disagree with the title of online safety commissioner.  Any school curriculum that is developed should not just focus on how to protect one's password.  It talks about not sharing a toothbrush.  Those analogies are very helpful and useful for working with children, but ultimately it is about not being a bad actor oneself and reframing it in that way.<\/p> <p>  We feel there should be monetary sanctions on the platforms after they have been notified and if it has been escalated to the regulator.  For example, in Australia and New Zealand, there are fines of up to $300,000 for every instance of non-compliance with the takedown request from the regulator.  The established platforms will comply with that and build systems to ensure that those requirements are complied with.

Meanwhile, here in Ireland, we have much more of what he described as easy wins, such as access to discrete pieces of legislation, for example, on image-based sexual abuse, and looking at the practices of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure they are human rights-proofed and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources and education to do that effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Farries"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1254,"content":"<p>Ms Farries mentioned the case of Dara Quigley, which goes to the heart of everything we are concerned with her.  Those of us who followed that case saw how an agency of the State behaved in that manner and failed repeatedly.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has appeared before this committee many times and we are always assured that everything is done properly and followed through, yet this case and others arise.  It is a very appropriate warning that things are not right and that we need to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  I was going to follow up on my question about the Goliaths.  If all those agencies were held to account, one of their arguments is that when they get this stuff up and it goes out there, they lose a certain amount of control.  It is my view, and I wonder if it is shared, that if greater sanctions were in place, the companies could build it in to ensure they would have more control.<\/p><p>I certainly see that reflected in online content, which is often very intimidatory and bullying.  When two groups in society identify online as opposites, they start arguing online and some of the dialogue becomes terribly intimidating and aggressive.  This attracts an audience.  I sometimes think that this is the social media companies' game.  It is what they want.  That also needs to be examined.  Bullying is a very closely related issue.  As others have said, this goes beyond what happens online.  It concerns society at large.  Mention has been made of a cultural problem.  People behave much worse online than they would if they were in a room with each other.  When they get used to behaving a certain way online, they start behaving the same way on the street or in a room with others.  That is where it can lead. <\/p><p> It is almost a closed or fascistic mindset.  It is about domination and refusing to have any civil discourse on anything.  It is a case of them being right and all others being wrong.  People form identity groups, which they can do very easily online.  It is a way of enhancing their status.  People come to think that nobody is as good as their group.  Their view of themselves is so wonderful that anyone who says anything else is to be wiped out.  This culture has developed considerably online and I now see it developing in society.  Everyone can recognise this as very harmful.  Should there be an obligation on the social media companies, which provide the space for this to happen, to warn against it?  There should be legislation obliging them to give space on their sites to warning messages, just like we have legislation requiring labels on cigarettes to warn that they are dangerous.  There should be a warning on social media-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#S00400","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1256,"content":"<p>Would the Deputy like to direct his question to a witness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#T00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1257,"content":"<p>I do not have a witness to direct it to.

It goes to the heart of human nature and the way human beings behave when they are not educated to appreciate kindness, inclusivity, diversity and equality.  One analogy is the time in history when schools were first established.  Bullying happened in classrooms and teachers did not see it as a problem.  They saw it as boys being boys.  They thought it was just how kids behaved, and as long as it did not get too far out of hand, teachers did not see a need to step in.  Educators later realised the damage this caused to individuals and we realised that education has a very important role in helping human beings to overcome the inclination to dominate or be aggressive towards others.<\/p><p>Perhaps something similar needs to happen in the new parallel society online and some kind of duty of care should emerge.  If I own a coffee shop and two people are having an argument in it, am I responsible for that argument?  Probably not, but I have a duty of care if the argument gets out of hand and I might need to step in and ask them to take their argument somewhere else.  I would be obliged to uphold a standard of behaviour in the coffee shop.  Something should be done to make that duty of care very clear to social media companies and other platforms.  It must be clear that certain standards of behaviour are not acceptable in this space.  I do not know how that can be realised technologically.  In the past, people joined clubs that had rules.  When people joined the club they signed up to behave in a certain way, knowing that if they did not do so they would be shown the door.  This is not a new problem but we need to deal with it in a new place, that is, online. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>I wish to make two points, first, about our online responsibilities as individuals and, second, concerning the responsibilities of social media companies.  In regard to individual behaviour, it is very important not to focus on warning people about what may happen if they engage with social media.  That implies that it is individuals' responsibility not to be abused.  We think it is better to focus on creating firm codes of conduct that apply to everyone who is active online, on a social media platform or elsewhere.  It should be our responsibility not to abuse others on the platform.  How that works must be very clearly laid out.<\/p> <p>  I wish to refer to the points made about social media companies' behaviour.  Reference has been made to the point at which a piece of content is shared too much and taking it down is effectively beyond the power of these companies.  It is important to outline how modern social media companies operate.  Much has been said about the challenges of getting a piece of content taken down.  While the companies may not have control over whether an individual uploads something, a piece of content, abusive or otherwise, does not get hundreds of thousands of views and shares because individual users choose to amplify it.  A modern social media platform generally has algorithms that work behind the scenes to boost content.  The technical details can be murky but as we will all be aware, content is generally boosted because it is controversial.  It is content people want to click on because it might outrage them or elicit a reaction.  Everyone who is on Twitter will be aware that users no longer have to actively amplify a piece of content to get it on to other people's timelines.  Content is shared because it is popular.  It is a chicken and egg phenomenon.  However, that does not happen in a vacuum.  It certainly does not happen because we all decide to boost a certain piece of content.  It happens because of processes social media companies put in place to boost content.  It is absolutely the case that the bigger a piece of content is, the more the companies are responsible.  We should never assume that content simply gets out of a platform's control.  The reason something gets out of control is the processes those platforms have actively put in place and propagated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jack Eustace"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>I appreciate the witnesses' contributions.

It is a very helpful process for us because there is no simple solution.  I acknowledge the points made by the witnesses, especially those from the ICCL, regarding the balancing of rights and the importance of the Garda, the State and the Oireachtas in addition to the platforms.  I am aware that only some of the bigger platforms have appeared before the committee.  The witnesses have pointed out that there are other platforms about which we should be equally worried.  The bigger companies reassured the committee of their interest in this area, as they do, in order to make profit, as they are entitled to do.  However, they referred to the e-commerce directive but did not freely acknowledge it is not up to scratch or fit for purpose.  We know it is not and that there is a process under way to update it.<\/p> <p>  The committee asked the companies about their self-regulation.  They were quite confident that their self-regulation was robust.  What jumps out at me are the comments of the representatives of the ICCL and the NABRRC regarding more accountability.  The NABRRC submission it states: \"Commissioning research into the evaluation of effectiveness of company self-regulatory measures should precede and inform any further steps about regulation.\"  Similarly, the ICCL is asking for companies to be more open in supplying information.  It seems to me that we are looking at a problem that we are all anecdotally aware is very serious, but we do not have the information to inform us on the proper steps to take.  There is a danger that we will go down the wrong route.  I will revert to Ms Blackwell.

It is a very important issue that requires more time and attention than it has received.  It is a good start to focus on social media companies as it goes to the heart of the matter.  The UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, has called for radical transparency from social media companies.  He stated that there needs to be a radical disclosure of all information in a manner that is meaningful.  Our perspective is that is not a radical request; it should be absolutely normative that social media companies be transparent in that way.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what the ICCL has done on this issue.  We issued two sets of submissions, both of which are available online and one of which regards content moderation generally and also the submissions to this committee specifically.  I very much appreciated the Deputy's questioning of Karen White of Twitter regarding what that transparency means.  The Deputy asked whether Twitter is disclosing what is going on in the background and being forthright in its quarterly publications.  The ICCL agrees with Amnesty International that those publications do not go far enough.  They present data, but those data are not meaningful.  Amnesty International provides very specific suggestions on how to make the data meaningful.  For example, the company may state that it took down content in a particular number of egregious situations and claim that is amazing.  We would like to know the number of reports of abuse it receives per year which fail to receive a response from the company.  We would like the reports to be disaggregated by category of abuse reported.  Social media companies often highlight that they took down particular posts or pages.  We would like to know the average time for such harmful material to be taken down.  That question has been asked of the social media companies by the committee.  We need to see that information transparently provided in their published reports, but that is not being done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#W01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Farries"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1287,"content":"<p><i>Spunout.ie <\/i>works closely with various platforms.

This is an area which has been of huge interest to Deputies, Senators and society as a whole.  I will be brief, as I do not want to labour any point.  We are here because of what was done to Dara Quigley.  I did not know her but a terrible wrong was done to that young woman.  We look at social media as a wondrous thing but it has an underbelly of depravity, which sometimes brings out the worst in people.<\/p><p>Justice has not been served with regard to those involved in Dara Quigley's untimely death, but I hope it will be.<\/p><p> These platforms make a great deal of money from young people and there is a form of social baiting that takes place on them.  They give a platform to people who would not normally act out in some ways.  They are given ways to act out online.  There is a great responsibility on technology companies to act responsibly not only in respect of themselves but in relation to the people who use their platforms.  Everybody has a smartphone.  In some ways, we love them because they are so useful and permit human beings across the world to communicate.  However, they have also become dangerous weapons that can destroy someone in the blink of an eye.  There have been other incidents in which people have shared images, videos and all sorts of material which were deeply personal and have wronged not only the victim but the victim's family also.  It is extremely difficult to police it.  The genie is out of the bottle.  How do we monitor the wild web?  It comes down sometimes to our own behaviour but largely to the companies that provide this technology.  They say it is freedom of expression and freedom of speech but one does not provide freedom of hate and freedom of depravity which hurts other people.<\/p><p> The question is how to police these platforms.  The law needs to change.  It must be updated from where it was in the mid-1990s.  The Internet did not exist as it does now 20 to 25 years ago.  If individuals did elsewhere what they sometimes do online, they would generally end up in court.  In Dara Quigley's case, for example, if someone put such images up in the form of posters all over the city centre and was identified, he or she would end up in a court of law.  There is no doubt about that.  However, the fig leaf provided by online platforms has given some people the green light to do things they should not.  It is just an observation.  The law must be updated.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act dates from the 1990s and contains no reference to cyberbullying or digital or online harassment.  I understand the law will be updated by the end of the current parliamentary term.  I hope that happens to protect everyone who uses the Internet.  The Internet is here to stay but while there are positives to it, there is also an underbelly that has extremely detrimental effects on our physical and mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#Z01300","speaker":"1299","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1364,"content":"<p>The Deputy is not asking a specific question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#AA00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1365,"content":"<p>It is an observation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#AA00300","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1366,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very welcome and I thank him for attending today.

I became aware of the topic quite late and, as such, it was a bit of a last-minute dash.  I thank the committee for allowing me to contribute.<\/p> <p>  I am motivated to come here by two particular cases, namely, that of Dara Quigley and that of Jacqueline Griffin.<\/p><p>I have specific questions which are directed at all the witnesses.  One of the questions has in some way been answered in terms of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act.  What do the witnesses think of Deputy Howlin's proposed legislation?  Alternatively, to they believe we should look to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act?  I also refer to the amendment suggested by Dara's mam, Aileen Malone, on not including a requirement concerning intent to cause distress.  There is a huge onus on the individual or family to prove the intent of somebody else to cause distress.  In terms of the question concerning the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act or Deputy Howlin's legislation, how do the witnesses feel about moving away from revenge porn and creating another form of offence that does not specify that requirement on an individual?  I am not sure how many members are aware of Jacqueline Griffin's case concerning the sharing of her decapitated remains following her death on the M50.  She was a family friend of mine and her brother is one of my closest pals.  Because I know the distress and harm that caused to the Griffin family, I asked for their consent before I raised Jacqui's case because I watched the absolute horror that family faced.  I sat with him while he begged me to tell him the truth on whether I have seen that image, where it is and if it is still online.  It was absolutely horrific.  How do we begin to move, in the legislation and in the development of policy, to also include and have a conversation about giving consent when somebody is no longer alive to give it?  Paul asked me to contribute on his behalf this morning.  He sent me a few lines to read which I will paraphrase.  He says it better than I can.<\/p><blockquote>Jacqui wasn't alive to consent to the sharing of her decapitated remains all over social media.  Just because her accident happened in a public place should not mean that she does not have a right to privacy and dignity.  The damage that this caused our family has destroyed our faith in humanity.  It goes beyond the initial trauma of just seeing the image, but has completely destroyed our emotional well-being.  Everyday life is impossible.  Everything from travel, work and even our own ability to have an online presence.<\/blockquote><p>How can we begin to legislate for that?  We are very aware of who shared that image and I wonder what should be the criminal sanction on somebody that records somebody's death and something so horrific.  The online platforms acted as quickly as they could when we tried to intervene at the time.  How can we create legislation to deal with the recording by an individual of someone's death and is that an area that has been examined in the context of causing of harm?  Obviously the person in question is no longer there to take the case.  Can the case be taken on behalf of the family and due to the impact on the family?  What is the legal position in terms of that family being able to pursue something?  I wonder if that could be part of the conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#AA00500","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1369,"content":"<p>I will give witnesses an opportunity to respond because that is very specific, very particular and very upsetting.

I also thank Paul for the statement, which captures very well the types of harms that are experienced when these images are shared without consent online.  It illustrates perfectly how incredibly damaging and challenging it can be.  I would like to respond to the two specific questions asked by Senator Ruane about criminalisation and the types of legislation that we might look at.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties supports the findings of the Law Reform Commission.  There might be an amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act in order to criminalise those sorts of behaviour.  We specifically talked about image-based sexual abuse.  We support the criminalisation of that through an amendment of that specific Act.  We also support the creation of a civil wrong.  That is the response to the first question.<\/p> <p>  I will now respond to the second question on the intent to cause distress.  Senator Ruane referenced Dara's mother's statements about that to the media.  There is Scottish legislation dealing with image-based sexual abuse that focuses on the circulation of these images with the intent to cause distress.<\/p><p>That does not go far enough because, as we have said in the submissions, intention to cause distress is not the only motivation.  There are a variety of intentions.  To be clear; criminal law requires intent.  There needs to be an action and an intention.  We just want to be careful that we do not inadvertently narrow that intention so that other reasons are lost.  Perhaps someone circulates an image because he or she thinks it will be lucrative and he or she wants to make a lot of money.  Perhaps it is being done for salacious reasons.  Perhaps the principal motivation is to violate someone's autonomy and dignity.  That does not necessarily capture distress alone so, as always, we need to be very careful about how we draft this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Farries","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1372,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for raising this case.  I also thank Paul for allowing us to hear Jacqueline's story today.  From our perspective, as Ms Farries has described, any legal framework has to consider intent but it should also include impact.  One of the things that we have seen in the devastating consequence of harms that are caused to people through the sharing of content online is that often the impact is minimised and often is not well understood.  While we might have heard of Jacqueline's case at the time, it is really important to hear Paul's story today articulating that it does not just end there, that the impact is much further-reaching and there is a longevity to it that people do not realise.  From our perspective, in terms of somebody who shared those images, and in the case of Dara Quigley as well, while obviously we are not in those people's frame of mind, we have seen that the public are just not aware of the consequences of their actions.  Whether there is intent there or not, people need to understand that publishing images as distressing as the ones mentioned denies a person the right to privacy and dignity.<\/p> <p>  One of the first cases we had to comment on in that regard concerned a music festival and a young girl whose images were posted online.  We would have thought we had come some way since that point towards understanding the consequences of sharing content that we do not have the right to share.  It is not within our gift to decide whether content should be shared.  There is obviously context to the issue as well.  We must think about the platforms as well, in that when the Arab Spring was happening or even when the violence was perpetrated against people fighting for independence in Catalonia, there is a context to some of this content.  We should be able to see some of the harms that are caused to people but, again, it should be proportionate and there should be mature consideration about where that applies and where it does not apply.  For us, ultimately, it has to focus on impact on the individual.  Again, the reason we need a digital safety commissioner is to be able to escalate hard cases like this where time is of the essence to be able to restrict the further sharing of such content.  To be fair, the platforms do respond in certain circumstances such as those outlined.  I do not think they have to be of such a gravity as the cases of Jacqueline and Dara to require a quick response.  Every case where there is content about a person or that causes a person distress should be responded to just as quickly as in those circumstances.  We need to create the framework to allow that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1373,"content":"<p>The example is so horrific it hits one in the face that even though it is a legal matter, it is also a civil and human matter.  Most of the work we do is with young people but we just should not engage in adult-to-adult sharing.  We have rights but there are responsibilities on us to act appropriately.<\/p><p>Young people are a little better at this because they have lived more in the online world and are fluid between both.  For some reason, the adult generation seems to see it as being separate offline and online worlds.  We do not seem to see that we have to be responsible online in the same way.<\/p><p> With regard the impact of bullying, the definition of bullying that we use in our work and research is that there has to be repetition, intent to cause harm, a negative impact and a power hierarchy.  That holds for cyberbullying when it is peer-to-peer, but some of those things will be different.  Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned that it might not be persistent.  A person might take one photo, so it might be hard to penalise that person or say that he or she is perpetrating bullying because he or she has only done it once or shared it once.  However, the impact on the victim is repetitive and those images have been shared all over the place.  It is persistent in that sense and it is harder to see if there was intent to cause harm.  Once those images are available, there will be an impact no matter what, because one does not know where they are and cannot imagine where they will go next.  The ideas relating to intent needs to be changed.  We need to think more about consent being sought and make sure that we have appropriate language, understanding that we should be asking for consent from the beginning before we take any image and share it.  Rather than focusing on sexual or horrific content, it should be in our day-to-day language and we should flip the way society talks about it from being a separate, online issue.  We should be asking for consent offline before taking a photo or sharing it.  Young people are a bit better at doing that than adults.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1375,"content":"<p>There is a legal question and Dr. Foody has talked about intent and impact.

I have listened to what has been said and I am very conscious of Senator Ruane's contribution.  The contributions indicate the multifaceted nature of what we are dealing with.  I am not a legal expert, nor am I an expert on social media, as much as I would like to think I am.  It is absolutely apparent that young people are using platforms that are not even familiar to most of us.  We had a presentation on this theme at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly yesterday, where I asked the question that I am going to ask the witnesses.  Please do not interpret it as me being glib since I mean it sincerely.  Since it represents the bulk of what we are dealing with and what we understand to be the main form of online harassment and harmful communication, I would like to get some understanding from the witnesses about how we go about legislating for toxic, harmful or warped masculinity.  For me, there seems to be a common thread throughout most, though not all, harmful, abusive communications online.  The need for education and a cultural change was discussed at the meeting I was at yesterday and that is absolutely the case.<\/p> <p>  We have referred to the main social media providers such as Twitter and Facebook and things being posted on their services.  We could implement laws and define the legal instruments required to deal with some of this.  However, if we do not legislate for the root cause, then even with the greatest will in the world, if something is posted and dealt with in a matter of minutes, taken down, and sin &eacute;, it has still found its way in that time onto WhatsApp and such, where it is shared on perhaps 47 different group chats with an average of 20 people each.  There is an issue of culpability, and I would like a clearer understanding of who is responsible.  Is it the producer of the image, the sharer or the holder?  People have God knows how many WhatsApp messages a day and sometimes they do not even know what they have been sent.<\/p> <p>  I would appreciate the witnesses' views on those themes.  That is not to let the providers off the hook.  Legal and legislative instruments need to be agreed and provided for, but we need to address it fundamentally as opposed to just saying that we need to change the culture or to have a societal conversation.  We have seen that problem of toxic, harmful and warped understandings of masculinity on public platforms and how harmful some of that can be.

For example, the introduction of the Equal Status Acts and related legislation around that sends a message out to society that we should not discriminate against people on certain grounds, but it also has a ripple effect and it has an effect in terms of thinking about their behaviour.  That kind of legislation, set alongside education, can have a very positive effect.  However, there is still not enough going on in our education system.

Research tells us they are slow to deal with some of these topics in the classroom because they are not comfortable talking to kids about some of the issues that might come up in a classroom when dealing with these topics.

Ultimately, it is from infancy upwards, which is a long game.  However, in terms of what we can do in the short and medium term, for perpetrators, who are predominantly male, at present there is no accountability so there is no deterrent to refrain from engaging in either offensive behaviour or harmful behaviour.  The purpose of all of us being here today is that we have seen that the lack of specific offences on the Statute Book has prevented garda&iacute; in local Garda stations around the country from being able to take reports and complaints from citizens about, say, image-based sexual abuse, harassment, cyberbullying or otherwise, and bring those cases through to resolution after deciding whether it is a civil or criminal matter.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, we need to see the garda&iacute; being able to very clearly see what is an offence on the Statute Book and being able to take that and enforce it, so there is a deterrent that stops people from engaging in this type of behaviour.  At present, there simply is not.  We see so many cases where images are shared in private messaging groups and, ultimately, there is no sanction for that.  Therefore, we cannot be surprised that it continues to happen.<\/p> <p>  We do not solicit these cases and we are not a one-to-one service, but somehow they still come to us because there is nowhere else for people to go.  We have had a number of cases where younger guys, perhaps in their late teens, have shared images with somebody else, where the other person had a false identity and was then extorting them with the threat of sharing the images publicly.  That has a huge impact on those young people.<\/p><p>We have been able to escalate them to the child exploitation unit within the Garda.  However, at local level the resources and capacity to respond are just not available.  We need the legal framework to be able to do it.  We need legal aid for young people to gain access to remedies quickly.  Ultimately, we need the regulation to regulate any other harmful content.<\/p><p> To address the Senator's opening point, just because something is posted and taken down quickly, there is still the event and it should still be prosecuted, particularly where adults are concerned.  It is not enough to have the content removed.  It still needs to be pursued.  It is not the case that once the content is removed, that is the end of the matter.  It should be pursued relentlessly in order that a deterrent is clear and clearly established in order that we can start to clamp down on this behaviour.  I hope education will do us right in time, but it is a long game.  We need to have the legal framework now in order to be able to deal with things in the short and medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019102300002#FF01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>As I agree with what Mr. Power has just said, I will not repeat it.  I recognise that it is not just a general air of toxic masculinity or toxic anything else, but very often it is a malicious intention to do harm through digital communications which currently cannot really be prosecuted.  The current harassment laws are insufficient, as are current stalking laws.  We need a better definition of communication and to have it recognised that, where harmful behaviour happens, it is harmful by reference to impact.  It will take into account particularly those who are targeted, not just the general fall-out of the harmful behaviour.  Sometimes, people are targeted and that should be a particular element of the prosecution in the case, which is very important.  It is the carrot and stick approach.  The carrot is education, with which we all agree.  As for the stick, to go back to Deputy O'Callaghan's analogy about driving a car, we stopped drink-driving partly by awareness raising but also because people's driving licences were being taken off them.

What we are seeing instead is the opposite in that the inequalities we experience offline are amplified online.  Toxic masculinity is certainly an example.<\/p> <p>  As for solutions, in our submissions to the committee, in addition to law and our rejection of the roll-out of State CCTV surveillance systems, we advocate changing these cultural issues at Garda level.  We advocate education, training, assessment and integrated modules across units to ensure the harm attached to the intersectional nature of online harassment, including toxic masculinity, are addressed.  We have to be very careful that we do not erase the context of power and marginalisation in which the inequalities occur by simply saying something like \"bullying\" or \"cyberbullying\".

There was a third suggestion that I have repeated over and over again today, but it has completely escaped me.  I feel it has not been part of the conversation, which is why it has left my mind.  <\/p> <p>  What about the expanding web of surveillance technology in the State to which we are all exposed?  It is increasing every day and it is not just coming from private companies.  It comes from the State.  We must fundamentally rethink it for the sake of privacy which, as I have outlined, is heavily codified.  There are also data protection principles at EU level.  The use of closed-circuit television systems is wholly unnecessary, given the level of invasion of our privacy.  The egregious treatment of Dara Quigley really illustrates the point.  The risks to our privacy and willingness to associate with people important to us, travel to areas of a city important to us and speak out are too great.  A host of rights are implicated.  The data which suggest CCTV systems warrant that invasion of our fundamental rights are not available.<\/p><p>It is not worth it and the horrible experience of Ms Dara Quigley illustrates that.

I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to outline the key issues of concern for farming and the agrifood sector arising from Brexit.  When I addressed the committee in May 2017 on this topic, we all expected that the UK would have left the EU on 29 March 2019, and we would be in a transition period and actively negotiating the future EU-UK trading relationship.  However, progress has been much slower than that.<br\/><br\/>Since the Brexit vote in 2016, there has been a great deal of analysis undertaken on the potential implications for the economy and the farming and food sector of the UK leaving the EU.  The results are clear and they are stark.  Brexit presents the most serious threat to farming and the agrifood sector in the history of the State.  With 37% of our food and drinks exports going to the UK, no other member state and no other sector is as exposed in these negotiations.  The UK is the market for 50% or close to 300,000 tonnes of beef exports.  The threat from Brexit is frightening for the beef sector.<br\/><br\/>Even before Brexit, massive damage is being done to agriculture.  In the past year alone, Brexit uncertainty and the devaluation of sterling have had a very negative impact on the agriculture industry, with losses in the beef sector alone at &euro;200 million up to the end of September 2019.  Last May, the EU Commission and the Government announced a Brexit support fund<b><\/b>to support beef and livestock farmers who had suffered &euro;100 million in Brexit losses between September 2018 and 12 May 2019.  However, when this scheme was formalised as the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM,<b><\/b>the criteria were so unnecessarily restrictive that farmers applied for only &euro;78 million in aid.  The IFA is still insisting that the &euro;22 million underspend is paid out to beef farmers to cover losses.  In the cattle trade further losses since May this year have accumulated, with prices at &euro;3.45 per kilo for R3 steers.  We estimate that between May and September, a further &euro;100 million was lost and this continues to accumulate at a rate of &euro;5.5 million per week in losses to farmers, hitting the viability of rural areas.  Farmer losses do not stop there.  Dairy farmers and mushroom growers have also been hit by the collapse of sterling.<br\/><br\/>In budget 2020, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, announced a &euro;110 million fund<b><\/b>to be made available by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the immediate aftermath of a no-deal Brexit. The IFA is calling for this money to be paid out now to all farmers who have experienced Brexit losses.  I remind the committee that these losses amount to a market disturbance under EU regulations.  They are due to the weakness of sterling and Brexit uncertainty, which are political factors totally outside the control of farmers.  The IFA is clear that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the EU must provide a &euro;1 billion Brexit fund of market support measures to include direct supports for farmers, structural and adjustment funding, as well as the setting aside of state aid limits. <br\/><br\/>Since becoming Prime Minister on 24 July, Boris Johnson has pursued a hard-line Brexiteer policy of leaving the EU on 31 October, with the ultimate objective of having an independent UK trade policy.  He appointed a Cabinet committed to a hard Brexit and failed to reappoint most Ministers who favoured a softer Brexit.  This marked a decisive shift from Theresa May&rsquo;s Government, which was more committed to a close trading relationship with the EU in the future.  Last Thursday, 17 October, EU leaders and the UK Government reached agreement on a revised withdrawal agreement and a revised political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship.<br\/><br\/>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, and their officials for their role in the negotiations.  I also want to mention the Opposition politicians in Leinster House who have been constructive throughout.  On the EU side, I particularly want to recognise chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team in the task force on Article 50 negotiations with the UK, TF50, for their hard work and deep understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s interests in these critical negotiations.  I also pay tribute to the EU 27 for their unity on this issue over the past three years.<br\/><br\/>The revised withdrawal agreement includes a new protocol on the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which replaces the backstop and will come into effect when the transition period expires on 31 December 2020, or later if the transition period is extended at the UK&rsquo;s request.  The new protocol applies to Northern Ireland only.  Northern Ireland will remain aligned to key rules of the EU Single Market to avoid a regulatory border on the island of Ireland.  These rules cover all goods including sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, rules for agrifood products and rules on agricultural production, marketing and state aid.  On customs, Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK's customs territory and will have the best of both worlds in terms of access to the EU market and the UK market.  To protect the EU's internal market, its customs code will apply to all goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain and third countries.  EU customs duties will be applied to goods entering Northern Ireland that are considered to be at risk of crossing the Border into the Republic and, therefore, into free circulation within the EU.  The purpose of the new protocol is to fully protect the integrity of the EU's Single Market and customs union, and avoid any regulatory and customs checks at the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which would undermine the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement. <br\/><br\/>The IFA supports the new protocol because it avoids a hard border in Ireland.  However, we would like to have full clarity on how trade flows will work in practice.  We need clarity on the precise arrangements for beef exports travelling across the Border into Northern Ireland and through Larne into Britain.  In regard to milk coming from Northern Ireland going into the Republic for processing, Northern farmers and Irish co-operatives need a clear commitment that this product can be labelled as Irish and EU, as it will continue to be in compliance with EU rules.<br\/><br\/>It is worth recalling that under Theresa May&rsquo;s all-UK backstop, which was rejected in Westminster, Northern Ireland remained aligned to Single Market rules, while the UK stayed in a single customs territory with the EU, with no freedom to apply lower tariffs.  The UK was also bound by measures to ensure a level playing field on state aid, competition law, the environment and climate change, labour and social protection and non-regression from current EU standards.  The backstop applied &quot;unless and until&quot; a new trading arrangement was agreed which avoided a hard border in Ireland.  Under the new protocol, Britain will have a greater ability to pursue an independent trade policy than it had under the backstop, and this is a cause for concern.  This is why the negotiations on the future trading relationship are so important. <br\/><br\/>The political declaration is a non-legally binding document, which sets out the ambitions of both sides for their future relationship.  The changes reflect the new UK Government&rsquo;s stated intention to pursue an independent trade policy.  It contains the shared ambition to have a free trade agreement, FTA, with zero tariffs and quotas between the EU and the UK.  However, it notes that the precise nature of commitments will be commensurate with the scope and depth of the future relationship and with commitments to ensure a level playing field.  It is all to play for in the future trade negotiations, where incoming EU trade Commissioner, Phil Hogan, will play a key role.While there is no certainty in the current political situation in Westminster, the IFA cautiously welcomes the revised withdrawal agreement on the basis that, if approved by parliament before 31 October, it will avoid a no-deal Brexit.  If the withdrawal agreement is ratified, the UK will enter a stand-still transition period until 31 December 2020.  The UK retains the right before 1 July 2020 to seek a once-off extension of the transition period to beyond December 2020.  However, 1 July 2020 is now only eight months away and that deadline threatens a new cliff edge on 31 December 2020 when, in the absence of a negotiated new trading relationship, the EU and the UK would have to trade on basic WTO terms.<\/p><p>This leaves Irish farmers and the agrifood businesses facing ongoing uncertainty, which is seriously damaging to their businesses.  We remain concerned about the impact on our markets and producer prices of sterling devaluation and future trade uncertainty.  Therefore, if and when the withdrawal agreement is passed, I strongly advocate an early decision for a realistic extension of the transition period, which would give much needed certainty to Irish farmers and agribusiness.  From our experience to date, the trade agreement negotiations on a free trade agreement, FTA, between the EU and the UK will be just as difficult as the negotiations over the past three years on the withdrawal agreement.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will now comment on Europe's future trade arrangements with the UK and the UK's determination to pursue an independent trade policy.  The IFA is concerned that disruptions to the UK market, through the imposition of tariff barriers, border checks, certification requirements or other regulatory changes, or new entrants to the UK market could seriously undermine Irish exports and render our trade uneconomic.  A reduction in import tariffs, an increase in tariff-free access or any lowering of product standards by the UK for the Mercosur countries of South America, or for hormoned beef from the US, would fundamentally undermine the competitive positioning of Irish and EU product on the UK market and reduce the value of the UK market.<br\/><br\/>In the dairy sector, more than one quarter of our exports go to the UK.  It is our main market for cheddar.  There is no alternative.  Increased low-priced competition on the UK market would destabilise the Irish dairy sector.  In the sheep sector, the key issue is the division of the existing EU tariff rate quota, TRQ, of 228,000 tonnes of New Zealand lamb imports and the destination of these imports.  Across virtually every sector of agriculture, in beef, dairy, lamb, mushrooms and forestry, there is a real threat from reduced access to the UK market through tariff barriers<b><\/b>and a loss in the value of the UK market through increased low-cost imports<b><\/b>or any undercutting of EU product standards.  The IFA is, therefore, seriously concerned about the risk of trade displacement for Irish exports to Britain, where Britain could import products from non-EU countries at lower tariffs and, possibly, lower standards to supply its home market, while continuing to export its own production to the EU.  If this were to happen, the EU may have to apply tariff quotas on imports from the UK.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, the<b><\/b>IFA remains seriously concerned about the potential reduction in the CAP budget post Brexit.  As a net contributor to the EU budget, the UK exit from the EU creates uncertainty about the size of the CAP budget post 2020.  The EU Commission has proposed a reduction in the CAP budget to 28.5% of the overall EU budget, down from 55% in the 1980s.  This proposal represents a cut to the Irish CAP budget of &euro;97 million per annum or 5% in nominal terms.  With the 2% proxy rate of inflation applied, the real impact of the cut amounts to 17%, or &euro;246 million per annum, for Ireland.  A reduction in the CAP budget would directly and negatively impact on Irish farm incomes across all sectors and the viability of rural Ireland.  The Irish Government must, therefore, press other member states to increase their EU budget contributions under the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The IFA recognises the ongoing commitment of the EU and the Irish Government, with the support of the Opposition parties, to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland, with customs checks and other controls and the risks to the peace process.  This is vital for farmers on both sides of the Border, for Border communities and the Border economy.  If the current withdrawal agreement is ratified, the EU and the Irish Government must be vigilant to ensure the integrity of the market in the Republic and of the EU Single Market is fully protected against illegitimate imports.<br\/><br\/>The IFA policy position remains that the optimum outcome of the Brexit negotiations would be for the UK to remain within the Single Market and the customs union.  However, we are gravely concerned that the policy of the current UK Government is to be outside the Single Market and the customs union and to diverge from EU regulations and standards in pursuit of an independent trade policy.  The IFA's objectives for any new EU-UK trading relationship include tariff-free and quota-free trade for agricultural and food products; full UK regulatory alignment to current and future EU standards, including food safety, animal health and welfare, and environmental standards; and continued UK application of the EU's common external tariff and tariff rate quotas for agricultural and food products.  The EU must use its leverage in the forthcoming trade negotiations with the UK to maintain the value of the UK market for Irish food exports, which in turn will ensure the stability of the EU food market.<br\/><br\/>The IFA's overall objectives remain no hard border on the island of Ireland, on which there is progress with last week's agreement; minimal restrictions on trade with the UK; and no scope for the UK to pursue a cheap food policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1497,"content":"<p>Before I call Mr. Chestnutt, I am aware that Mr. Healy's term as president is coming to an end.

It is a pity we are not here in better circumstances.  However, we are where we are.  Mr. Healy gave an impressive opening statement in which he laid out the past and where we are, so I will try not to be repetitive.<\/p> <p>  We all know where this crisis began.  The Ulster Farmers' Union did not campaign one way or the other but our membership was split.  We did hold an event for farmers at which each option was debated.  We take our decision-making from our membership.  The position of the Ulster Farmers' Union from the start was that in the absence of a compelling reason to leave, there was no reason to do so.  We felt this was the right decision to take.  We then moved to former Prime Minister Theresa May's first deal, which included a Northern Ireland backstop.  We reviewed the deal.  Approximately 85% of our produce in Northern Ireland is sold to the GB market.  As such, it is our main market.  We noted that the first agreement provided for free and frictionless trade for our producers to the British market, which is our main concern.  Having been reassured of this, we supported the agreement.  As everybody is aware, this debate has been very political from the beginning.  In taking that decision and sticking our heads up, we received a great deal of criticism, which in some instances was quite nasty.  We are where we are and we stand by that decision.<\/p> <p>  We have moved on from that point.  As we all know, former Prime Minister Theresa May's deal did not get support and there is a new deal on the table.  Mr. Healy commented on that deal and mentioned that for Northern Ireland it is the best of both worlds.  We are not so sure about that.  There are matters on which we need clarification.  I would like at this point to set some background to the Northern Ireland industry.  Approximately 30%, or 642 million litres, of the milk produced in Northern Ireland goes to the UK; 12% to the Republic of Ireland, ROI; 17% to other EU countries; and 6% to the remainder of the world.  All live calves in the dairy trade go to the South and onwards through southern exporters.  In regard to beef and sheep, our exports to ROI are worth &euro;83 million.  The value of live cattle exports is &euro;9 million.  Some 40% of the lambs we produce in Northern Ireland go to the South for slaughter.<\/p><p>I farm as far north as one can get in Northern Ireland.  From our farm, one can see over to Scotland.  As we speak, there is a lorry picking up lambs to go to Irish Country Meats in Navan.  We have done this for the past number of years.  A total of 40% of our lambs come south for slaughter.  It is not all one-way trade.  In the pig sector, 27% of the pigs we kill in Northern Ireland come from the Republic of Ireland.  The food industry on the island of Ireland is completely integrated and to try to rip it apart makes no sense.  In the poultry sector, 11% of meat goes to the Republic of Ireland - day-olds and chicks.  A total of 50% of laying hens go to the Republic of Ireland for slaughter while the other 50% goes to Great Britain.  Chicken parts are rendered and some of the rendered material goes to the Republic of Ireland.  Some of our litter goes to a biodigester in Donegal while our feathers go to Cork for manufacture so the industry is completely integrated along with some of our produce that is manufactured in Northern Ireland and goes out through Dublin Port.  It goes without saying that to try to rip this apart makes no sense at all.  <\/p><p> I said that we have a deal on the table but we need clarity.  One of the main things exercising us is what would happen to Northern Ireland produce if it was processed in the South.  Can it then be treated as Irish and go to the rest of the world as part of EU trade deals?  Mr. Healy raised this point.  If this produce cannot go to the rest of the world as part of EU trade deals, Irish companies in the South may not want our produce if they cannot market it.  The lambs coming from my area to Irish Country Meats in Navan are not coming down to the food market in the South.  They are coming down here for processing to go to the rest of the world so they need to be able to access those EU trade deals.  We have asked for clarification on this but have received conflicting clarifications.  Tom Tynan, a member of Commissioner Phil Hogan's staff, is telling us one thing while our own Government is telling us something else so we are waiting for clarification on that point.  <\/p><p> It is the same the other way round.  There are qualifying goods.  When pigs come up to Cookstown to be slaughtered, which is where the main plant for slaughtering pigs from the Republic of Ireland is located, are processed and go into the British market, do they constitute a qualifying good?  Does all pigmeat out of Cookstown then not become a qualifying good?  These are the sort of questions to which we need answers so it works both ways.  We need those issues to be clarified.  <\/p><p> Where are we as far as politics is concerned?  It is changing by the hour.  It is very fluid.  I was over in Westminster with the president giving evidence in a situation similar to this.  Afterwards, we spoke to our own MPs in the lobby.  At that time, we thought that the DUP would be able to back this deal but we know what has happened since.  Who is to know what the next steps are?  It seems to be one step and two steps backwards.  Mr. Healy is right that Brexit has not only had an impact in the South.  We are already feeling the impact in the North.  Our milk is 2.3 pence a litre behind the UK price this year.  Our sheep are probably about &pound;20 per skull behind the price in the South simply because the southern companies were more anxious to supply Southern lamb rather than Northern lamb because of its security.  Regarding our beef, the figure we reckoned we lost due to Brexit was &pound;27 million a month ago.  We have no EU or UK beef aid scheme in Northern Ireland so our farmers are feeling the pinch.  <\/p><p> On a more positive note, this deal does seem to be the basis of something if we can get some clarity, particularly around goods coming from the North to the South to be processed or goods from the South coming north to be processed.  Can these goods be included in EU trade deals or enter the UK market?  We would welcome clarification on that.  We may be able to come out and support it.  From the word go, the Ulster Farmers' Union was constant in saying we cannot have a no-deal situation.  We have been resolute on this every time we were asked about it.  Some of our politicians said earlier on that they were quite content to go out with no deal.  I think we have managed through our lobbying to get through to them and hardly any politicians north of the Border say that now.  We have worked on that.  We would like to see this uncertainty pass and for us to get to the start line but, as Mr. Healy rightly noted, that is just the start line.  We must then negotiate a trade deal but we have had a good history for years as neighbours in the agrifood industry and this history has been reinforced by the complete integration of the food chain on the island of Ireland.  Sometimes it frustrates me when I hear the issue of Border communities being raised because this is not about Border communities.  It is about the whole island of Ireland.  I farm as far north as one can get.  My son's milk goes to the South, as do my lambs.  My wool goes to Donegal.  The whole thing is completely integrated.  It is not a strip around the Border so as far as the North is concerned, for the sake of the prosperity of agriculture, we need to do something sensible to get this worked out.  Any negotiation always involves a wee bit of give and take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Victor Chestnutt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>I will not read out my statement verbatim because we have submitted our views.  While it may be coming towards Mr. Healy's last time, it is my first time in the Seanad.  I have appeared regularly before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  My predecessor appeared here in May 2017.  As Mr. Healy said, all eyes were on 29 March 2019 at that point.  There was a degree of complacency because it was a long time away but that day came and went.  There was a lot of uncertainty in the build-up to it and there is still a lot of uncertainty.  We can see from what Mr. Chestnutt said that uncertainty affects agriculture on the entire island.  They can point the finger at the sector from a climate point of view at times but from a sectoral point of view, we are extremely vulnerable to Brexit - North and South.<\/p> <p>  Some of the figures were mentioned.  Mr. Healy said that 37% of food and drinks exports went to the UK in 2018.  A total of 50% of our cheese was exported there in 2018, including 83% of our cheddar.  We see the likes of Carbery Group having to respond to that at a significant cost to its shareholder producers with a new plant involving the production of mozzarella and other cheeses built at a cost of &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million to diversify its product portfolio.  A total of 30% of our dairy exports go to the UK.  I listened fully to what Mr. Chestnutt said about integration and how industries depend on each other from a processing and feeds perspective.  The flow has been both ways and both sides of the Border are equally vulnerable.  How would the likes of Lakeland Dairies market itself in the event of a hard Brexit or a hard border given that it has plants North and South of the Border?  A total of 52% of our beef goes to the UK.  The beef sector has been in severe turmoil over the summer, much of it associated with the unknown of Brexit.  Farmers are fearful about their future.  As Mr. Chestnutt said, we need clarity on these issues because the uncertainty is paralysing our industry.  <\/p> <p>  We are not the only ones exporting to the UK.  The Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain and Italy all export to it but it is our closest, longest-established and most rewarding market from a number of perspectives given that North-South and east-west trade are equally important.  What are the consequences of a hard Brexit?<\/p><p>There will be a lack of confidence in our community, with GDP estimated to drop by 10%.  Purchasing power will be absent and that will have an effect on what consumers do and how they react.<\/p><p> Mr. Healy mentioned BEAM.  That was to compensate some farmers in beef production until 12 May.  It was over-regulated and, consequently, undersubscribed.  It was over-regulated because its principal objective was to be a compensation package for the financial losses that farmers incurred in beef production.  It was regrettable that not all farmers in beef production were part of that scheme.  The ICMSA made no apology in highlighting the issue that dairy farmers were excluded.  Ultimately, dairy farmers with 41 or 42 cows found themselves excluded.  It brought in environmental constraints that made it unattractive for farmers to apply for a scheme that should initially have been to compensate for losses incurred in beef production.  Since 12 May, there have been significant and ongoing losses.  While we welcome the &euro;85 million in the budget last week, the shackles need to be taken off that.  It cannot be a no-deal compensation package.  It should be retrospective package covering 12 May to budget day.  Farmers have ongoing losses.  We have seen frustration among farmers and fear among farm families.  All farmers in beef production need to be compensated in the future.<\/p><p> I touched on the finalisation of the agreement.  We need to remove the uncertainty as soon as possible.  The transition period needs to allow for negotiations and stabilisation to take place.  Volatility is the greatest challenge for farm families.  That has been exacerbated as a result of a potential Brexit.  Unfortunately, in this most recent budget, the Government failed to grasp the nettle with a farm management deposit scheme, which would allow farmers to build a tax-efficient buffer to deal with poor years and unexpected and unwarranted income volatility.  We are exposed to the turbulence caused by politicians around the globe, as we have seen with President Trump and the USA's tariffs on the Kerrygold brand.<\/p><p> With regard to the farm management deposit scheme, an enterprise stabilisation fund is needed.  I mentioned the Carbery Group but other parts of industry will have to cope with whatever Brexit brings to us.  While we may be six or eight months away from the original date, there is still have much unknown ground ahead.<\/p><p> Critical issues in the future include being tariff free.  The introduction of the proposed tariffs would mean an increase of approximately 3 cent per litre of milk.  As it is, the unknown future is probably costing 3 cent per litre of milk as a result of currency fluctuations and uncertainty.  It was alluded to earlier that the CAP budget would be significantly hit.  It is imperative that the CAP budget be maintained.  It is up to the 27 other member states to secure that for the future.<\/p><p> Input costs are always a significant issue.  We have many members along the Border who are concerned that mutual recognition of approval and accreditation needs to be brought in, whether it is for feed or for various other farm inputs.  It would be anti-competitive in any other scenario, especially along the Border.  The costs of competitiveness need to be addressed.  That is an ongoing issue, including as we face Brexit.  Energy, credit, legal and other costs such as insurance need to be addressed in advance of Brexit.  Mr. Healy alluded to trade deals.  We will have the EU and UK trade deal, with the potential of other deals between others and the UK.  With this in mind, our Government needs to be more proactive in securing the rejection of the Mercosur deal.  The implementation of this deal and its impact will more than likely be felt at the same time as the impact of Brexit following the transition period.  It is imperative that the 99,000 tonnes of beef potentially coming into Europe, along with the beef potentially entering the UK, are readjusted.<\/p><p> Consumer confidence is a critical issue and we need to maintain that, considering our island status.<\/p><p> There are day-to-day on-farm challenges for farmers along the Border with land fragmentation, including issues with the basic payment scheme and nitrates.<\/p><p> We have succeeded with regard to health on an all-island basis.  We have eradicated brucellosis from the island of Ireland and it is imperative that, whatever happens with Brexit, the relationships that have been built and enhanced over recent decades are built on to eradicate diseases such as bovine viral diarrhea, Johne's disease, and ultimately tuberculosis too.  That level of co-operation must be continued and intensified for the good of all of us.<\/p><p> The potential of a hard border with the Six Counties seems to have reduced but we must be conscious that there is no deal until there is a full deal.  Some 32,000 milk lorries transit the Border each year.  Any Border checks would have a significant cost associated with them, without even mentioning tariffs.  We need to continue to maintain alliances at a European level to support the Irish position.  We are extremely exposed, both North and South.  A transition agreement needs to cover as long a time as possible to get the best outcome.  As a nation, we need to recognise that farm families need tools to get through this and the volatility that we have seen recently.  I mentioned the farm management deposit scheme and the enterprise stability fund.  We cannot afford to have a hard border.  It is essential that the existing trading arrangements continue for the benefit of both sides of the Border and further afield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1502,"content":"<p>We have 15 minutes left in this session.

They have highlighted the complexity of the agrifood industry and the fact that it is an all-island industry.  Following the conversations I have had about Brexit, I am concerned about \"Brexit fatigue\".  If people think they are fatigued after three years then, by golly, they will be fatigued if the UK leaves.  We may still be having these conversations in ten years.  My first question is for Mr. Chestnutt, who may have been interested in Mr. Healy's comments.  I was at a British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting earlier this week.  One theme that came out of that meeting is that the Scottish and Welsh are not happy with the deal currently on the table.  They feel that they will be disadvantaged and that it is an unattractive arrangement.<\/p> <p>  We have an all-island agrifood economy.  Is there a mechanism that allows farm representative organisations to work together to represent agriculture or do they have fundamentally different positions that they cannot agree on?  I acknowledge the issues related to pricing and trade deals.  Those affect all organisations.<\/p><p>In the context of the Mercosur agreement - the provision relating to the 99,000 tonnes represents 1.2% of EU beef production - it will be like watching the fly on the wall when the Brexit bulldozers run us over.  Are all farm organisations North and South working together to try to get a good outcome from that?<\/p><p> Clarity is the elephant in the room here.  Nobody can get clarity in order to make plans or arrangements for their businesses.  I look at other businesses and industries that have the potential to be affected by Brexit.  I am aware that tensions exist between the organisations our guests represent and the processing sector.  Is there a dialogue taking place in order to work out how they can take the risk out of supply chains and ensure that any disruption will be minimised?  Is the disconnected supply chain leaving them in a position where they cannot have those conversations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#E00300","speaker":"1439","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  This discussion is of extraordinary significance in that the agricultural sector - and the ancillary jobs in food processing and other areas - is the most threatened sector in the context of either a soft or a hard Brexit.  The sector we are discussing is the most vulnerable and exposed, and that makes our discussion very important.  The transition agreement will be of extraordinary significance.  It is hoped that some of the issues our guests raised will be satisfactorily resolved within the transition agreement over the next couple of years.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge problem in the beef sector.  I could not be more aware of that because I have attended the various beef protests - not officially organised by the our guests - and met those involved.  Leaving aside the rights or wrongs of the protests or matters relating the tactics, there is a major issue in terms of income.  People sector are in very difficult circumstances in terms of their families.  They are at risk when it comes to keeping their homes and their livelihoods.  The state of affairs in the beef sector is shocking.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Healy indicated that he is concerned about the displacement of Irish products by those from Third World or Mercosur states that may come into the UK after the Brexit agreement goes through in a few weeks, as appears will now happen.  How realistic is that?  Is he exaggerating the position to some degree?  Will there not be an attraction for good-quality Irish food in the UK?  Ultimately, will that attraction not be sufficient to keep what we have in that market?  There is the possibility within the transition agreement of arranging the alignment of standards, etc.  How realistic is that?<\/p> <p>  How much of the beef sector's problems lie outside the Brexit agenda?  Out guests stated that they associate all the problems with Brexit.  How many of them are outside Brexit in terms of lifestyle issues, pricing and other matters that are not necessarily Brexit-related?  Could our guests isolate which problems relate to Brexit?  For example, is it the fluctuations in the value of sterling?  There is a possibility that those fluctuations might work in our guests' favour in the future.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the position of small farmers who have off-farm incomes from other work.  In the past, it was considered that they did not need support because they had jobs but they are subventing their beef farms and are almost broke in many cases.  How do we deal with them?  What practical steps would our guests recommend taking in order to support those people?  What interventions can we realistically make in that regard?  Will it all be checking the post stuff and, if so, how much and in what form?  How do we cushion the beef sector?<\/p> <p>  I understand the principles of CAP in that we have to have quality food available at a price at which consumers can buy it.  That is the principle on which CAP functions.  Where do our guests see the supports going in and how will that happen?  How do we deal with the crisis in the beef sector?  How much of it is being caused by Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#F00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1506,"content":"<p>I welcome the three groups and thank them for their presentations.  One can use the word &quot;stark&quot; in this case.  We were all familiar with the figures before our guests came in but their presentations offer a new realisation.<\/p><p>Following on from the Chairman's questions, I am aware that the two Republic of Ireland organisations are lobbying continually in Brussels.  The IFA is in a grouping with COPA; I am not sure about the ICMSA.  In those deliberations, and our guests stated that they were lobbying in Westminster, with the collective groupings with which they are involved in other European countries in particular, how are they interacting on this issue?  It is not as big an issue everywhere else as it is here.  Is it an issue at all?  Are they as concerned in Brussels as we are here?  Are our guests getting support from them?  I would like to hear about the type of engagement that is going on in that regard.<\/p><p>On a similar line in terms of CAP, in fairness, the Government is prepared to increase their contribution to the MFF to fill the hole that will be left if the UK leaves the European Union.  We were in Brussels getting briefings on this and trying to find out what was going on.  We were told in no uncertain terms that even if all the other states agreed and the budget was brought up to the <i>status quo<\/i>, there is no guarantee that the CAP budget would increase or that the extra money that would come in would go to CAP and that it might spent on immigration or climate change, or in some other area.  What are our guests hearing about that?  It has been a while since we were in Brussels and there have been many changes in the interim.  Our guests are in Brussels on a regular basis.  What are they picking up in that regard?<\/p><p>I do not want to be political but based on the presentations, this committee has a role to play in terms of going back to the Minister with regard to the underspend in the BEAM scheme.  That is the reason we are here.  I have raised this with the Minister.  I have been told again, in no uncertain terms, that it is an application-led scheme, which means that &euro;22 million will be returned.  The committee has a role to highlight, on the basis of the presentations we received, that this cannot happen.  If we do not spend the entire budget for the first scheme we are seen to introduce, it will send out the wrong message in the future when we go looking for funding cap in hand.  I am not being political but we have a role to play in respect of that matter.<\/p><p>Our guests have many questions to answer.  They might laugh at this one but I would like to get their take on it.  I have a bull at home that I bought in Trillick, County Tyrone.  The man I bought it from would have been showing bulls or heifers in Sterling, in Scotland, the week before or the week after.  The deal we did was seamless.  How do our guests see a deal of that nature?  It might sound simple but it is not all about trade.  Those types of transactions are going on farm to farm in the Republic of Ireland.  They are one-off transactions.  It is not all about the Lakeland Dairies organisations and thousands of pigs and sheep.  Based on what our guests have seen in the proposed agreement, and Mr. McCormack mentioned disease and animal health, taking all of that into consideration, how do they see my transaction on the bull or the position of my friend in Tyrone, who shows bulls in Scotland one day and in Carrick-on-Shannon the next, selling them into the Republic of Ireland and the UK, being sorted out when we get down to the nitty-gritty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#F00300","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>Many of the issues have been addressed but I will make some comments.

The ICMSA is involved with the European Milk Board, EMB, and there is good support and a good understanding of the potential of Brexit in that relationship, in particular the potential of Brexit from an Irish point of view because we have the unique structure of the land border.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly also spoke about the bull he bought in Tyrone.  It is necessary that UK farmers continue to farm in compliance with the European requirements.  One could look more favourably on continued open trade, but it is an imperative that they farm to the European level in compliance with standards for veterinary treatment and medicinal requirements.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly mentioned the transition period and good food.  The critical issue is that we do not find ourselves tariffed out of the marketplace through significant tariffs that would leave us uncompetitive in the UK.  The UK has traditionally followed a fairly merciless food policy on cheap food.  We need to find ourselves competitive in the supermarkets.<\/p> <p>  Part-time farmers were compensated under the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme irrespective of whether their off-farm income was earned through a standard job or they are multimillionaire hobby farmers.  That is right if those farmers were involved in beef and had a normal or reasonable off-farm income.  Equally, it is imperative that men with 42 or 43 cows are also part of the scheme.  It should also apply to men with 60 or 80 cows who may be struggling to put two or three kids through college.<\/p> <p>  Senator Marshall mentioned the Mercosur deal, which is going to put further pressure on farmers.  There is 300,000 tonnes of Irish beef going to the UK and we could be trying to relocate a market for that volume of meat at the same time that there will be 99,000 tonnes coming from South America into the EU which is already saturated to the tune of 102%, 103%, 104% or 105%, whatever the figure is, of the available market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1523,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for their questions and I will pick up on some that I think are relevant to Northern Ireland.  Senator Paul Daly asked a couple of questions about how we are getting on lobbying in Westminster and the UK.  The beef crisis is to the fore, especially with Scottish and Welsh beef, although not so much with the English.  We are at the bottom of the pecking order, along with the Republic of Ireland, in prices because we export so much and the UK has a home market.  We talk to them but there is no indication that they are on the same page as we are on the island of Ireland about the beef crisis.<\/p> <p>  I am a bull breeder so I am in that business.  I breed two or three different breeds of livestock.  My Charolais stock bull came from Yorkshire, through Stirling Bull Sales, and my Angus stock bull came from the South.  It is imperative that we keep that going.<\/p> <p>  I also breed sheep and my stock ram came out of the South this year and there is that trade, but it is highly regulated and has a paper trail.  Getting the right certification would be another page and it should not be impossible, so we will endeavour to try to keep those trade flows open.<\/p> <p>  Senator Marshall brought up the issue of beef and the Mercosur deal.  We need to remember that environmental standards and the cost of labour mean that somebody in Brazil can run a village and not pay labour costs.  Those are all the well-rehearsed reasons we should not have to compete with them on price.  It is worth noting that it takes 88 kg of carbon to take in 1 kg of beef from South America, whereas one produced at home only takes 18 kg, excluding any carbon sequestration our hedges or grassland do.  We cannot export our environmental problems if we continue to import beef.<\/p> <p>  The UK has proposed a free-trade deal for a certain amount of Brazilian beef, but even after that, steak cuts coming out of our factories in the North can sell wholesale at &pound;11 per kg.  The Brazilians can produce it at &pound;6 per kg and the EU has cut its tariffs on that meat to &pound;2 per kg.  That effectively means that the Brazilians can still undercut our market by &pound;3 per kg for those better steak cuts.  That is a big concern going forward.<\/p> <p>  Senator Marshall also asked about the supply chain.  We are making efforts but they are moving fairly slowly and we need to ramp up those efforts.  We need a fully integrated supply chain.  It is undoubtedly much slower than I would like and all of our organisations must keep working on that to try to integrate the supply chain.<\/p><p> On support for the beef industry and how we think it could be delivered, as far as I can see, there is only way we can get support for the beef industry in the long term.  We have an island that can grow grass and that grassland needs management.  It cannot all be managed by dairy cows.  We need to support the beef industry for managing grassland and I suspect that this is one way we, as managers of our landscape, should look at drawing down support to the beef industry.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked if we regretted not calling for a remain or leave vote in the referendum.  The Ulster Farmers' Union has a command structure from which we take our steer, and our farmers were well split.  There are other reasons that people wanted to vote for Brexit.  It is our job to look after the interests of farming but there are other reasons.  People did not like the future direction of the European Union and there were other political reasons.  We were not going to be drawn into the field.  We do not regret the decision, which we think was the correct one.  There are many people in Northern Ireland on both sides of the debate who would say we were correct in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#G01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Victor Chestnutt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>Last but not least, I ask Mr. Healy to wrap up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#H00200","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting earlier.  To go back to the question that was asked, it is very clear that the next round of the task force will take place when the injunctions are lifted.  The Goodman Group needs to ensure those injunctions are lifted and to allow progress to be made on the issues that Mr. McCormack outlined.<\/p> <p>  On market disturbance, the &euro;50 million was secured under Article 221 of Regulation (EU) No. 1308\/2013.  A question was also asked about work in Brussels.  As the first vice president of COPA, I am in Brussels quite often.  We continue to meet the Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, and other Commissioners and MEPs from other countries who we would not meet in Ireland.  This is to ensure we can put the facts in front of them.  We had done the analysis on what farmers were paid between September 2015 and March 2016, which was pre-Brexit.  We then compared that with the prices paid in the period from September 2018 to March 2019.  Those were the facts and we were able to highlight those.  The figures even excluded the increase in costs in the meantime.  When the prices were explained to the politicians and the other farm organisations they appreciated the huge difficulties Irish farmers were experiencing as a result of the uncertainty of Brexit.  That is without a no-deal Brexit or anything like it.<\/p> <p>  Throughout the Brexit negotiations, and indeed previously, the Irish Farmers' Association had an incredibly strong relationship with the Ulster Farmers' Union and the farming unions in Britain, including Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union in the UK, Andrew McCornick, NFU president in Scotland and John Davies, NFU president in Wales.  Just yesterday, I spoke in London at an event organised by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, AHDB, on global Britain and the implications of Brexit.  I was speaking from an Irish perspective on the Brexit implications for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Senator Marshall asked about Mercosur, an issue that has been well covered already.  As farmers, we see all the asks being put on us.  We hear our representatives in Europe and our politicians speak about climate change and the need for farmers to do this, that or the other.  We go to meetings where we try to embrace the issue of climate change and highlight its importance.  While we were doing that, however, the same European politicians agreed a deal with Mercosur.  Farmers see large tracts of the Amazon rainforest being destroyed.  We highlighted the fact that an area the size of a football pitch was being destroyed every minute in Brazil.  There is hypocrisy attached to that and there is a promotion of double standards of production, especially when one considers the standards of production that Irish and European farmers have to live up to.  That is the difficulty around Brexit.  Last year, EU beef production was 102% of what was required by the market.  That 2% excess is equivalent to some 160,000 tonnes of beef.  At the same time, 270,000 tonnes of beef was imported from the Mercosur countries, of which 140,000 tonnes was from Brazil.  If the pitch is level and if we produced beef the same way as it is produced in Brazil, we would not be allowed to put it on our shelves.  We are looking for a level playing pitch.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly asked how realistic is the prospect of Irish product being displaced.  That is a very realistic prospect.  The idea of a cheap food policy in the UK is major issue and one of our biggest concerns.  I spoke to my colleague, Minette Batters, in the UK some 12 months ago at a meeting hosted by the NFU in Newcastle.  Ms Batters commented that she had just met the chief executive of Tesco UK and his words to her were that the average shopper visiting a Tesco store in England had &pound;85 or less to feed a family of four.  If they had the choice between a cheap product and one produced to the top standards in the world, they might choose the former.  I believe displacement is very realistic.  We see the race to the bottom among retailers at the moment.  They may have a 33% discount on beef one day and 50% off the next day.  They are willing to use beef as a loss leader because research has shown that people who put meat in their shopping basket will spend four times more than those who do not have meat in their basket.  Retailers are willing to use beef as a loss leader.  The average retail price of beef in the UK is &pound;8.50 per kilo.  The average retail price in Ireland is &euro;8.97 per kilo.  The UK accounts for two thirds of our beef.  We are talking about &euro;8.60 per kilo at retail level but beef is sold to manufacturing and food services sector at an even lower price.  The fears in this regard are not a case of farm organisations crying wolf.  They are very real and we are seeing the effects already.<\/p> <p>  On small farmers, there is no discrimination in the payments made to part-time farmers, small farmers or big farmers.  The only discrimination we have seen over many years has been in the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM.  Someone could own an airline and draw money from the BEAM, whereas someone milking 41 cows could not draw it.  That approach was as close to discrimination as I could see.  It was wrong and it was pointed out to the Minister and Department.  Senator Paul Daly made a point about revisiting that.  It beggars belief and highlights how wrong the regulations on distribution were to see that two sectors, the suckler and beef sector, that are on their knees have not applied for all of that money.  The only reason they have not applied for it is the restrictions that were put in place.  A farmer who milks 45 or 50 cows is as much a beef producer as a dairy farmer, if he or she finishes the stock on the farm.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Common Agricultural Policy, the proposals include a 10% increase to the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which would increase from 1% of gross national income to 1.1% of GNI.  Unfortunately, it appears that the cost of the new initiatives on defence, security and migration will exceed the amount generated by the 10% increase.  This has resulted in the 5% cut to CAP.  As I highlighted, by the end of the next round of CAP, the total of the EU budget allocated to CAP will be 28.5%.<\/p><p>In 1985, a total of 55% of the EU budget was spent on CAP.  One of the original aims of CAP was to ensure an adequate supply of top-quality food to the consumer, a box we have more than ticked.  Another was that it would be available at affordable prices, another box we have more than ticked.  In the 1960s, when CAP was introduced, 30% of the average household income was spent on food, whereas today, the average throughout Europe is 10%, or 9.2% in Ireland.  Last year, Irish families spent &euro;124 per week on transport and &euro;123 per week on food.  That gives some idea of what CAP has done for the consumer.  Nevertheless, if consumers were asked about CAP or what they understood about it, many would reply it was a benefit or payment for farmers.  In essence, however, it has benefited the consumer more than it has the farmer, given that I am not sure whether it has achieved its third aim, namely, to provide viable incomes for farmers.<\/p><p> Senator Paul Daly asked about a bull and I thought for a moment he was talking about the bull we saw Boris Johnson leading around the place.

It represents the interests of more than 150 food, drink and non-food grocery manufacturers and suppliers.  We work with our colleagues in Dairy Industry Ireland, the director of which, Mr. Mulvihill, joins me today; Drinks Ireland; Meat Industry Ireland; and the Prepared Consumer Foods Council.  We welcome the opportunity to appear again before the committee, having done so on the same subject in 2017, and would like to acknowledge the committee's ongoing focus on Brexit as it affects agrifood.<br\/><br\/>Brexit involves an unprecedented fracture of the Single Market, with Ireland particularly exposed.  The food and drink industry remains especially reliant on the UK market and is the sector most exposed to Brexit.  While the UK market as a percentage of our overall exports has declined in recent years and now stands at 37%, in absolute value terms it continues to increase and now stands at &euro;4.5 billion, a 32% increase in value terms since 2010.  In the case of certain sectors and categories, it is a much higher level of exposure, with 50% of beef exports, 50% of cheese exports, 71% of beer exports, 85% of cider exports and 66% of prepared consumer foods exports going to the UK.  This demonstrates the importance of maintaining our market position in this high value, high quality market that has a substantial food deficit and of not relinquishing the market to global competitors.<br\/><br\/>Irish food and drink exposure in absolute value terms is similar to that of other large exporters to the UK, such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy.  In percentage terms, however, we are between four and five times higher.  Typically, less than 10% of those other member states' food and drink exports is to the UK.  This highlights the unique circumstances faced by Irish industry and the need for exceptional mitigation measures.  A further &euro;4 billion of exports goes to the other EU 26, with most using the UK landbridge.  Protecting our connectivity to continental EU markets is critical.  It is also an important trade route for food and drink ingredients and finished goods travelling from the Continent to Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In the event of a no-deal Brexit and the immediate imposition of tariffs, it is vital the EU institutions and national governments recognise the potential for economic disruption and take decisive steps to offset such risks.  Tariffs are in effect a tax on trade and commerce.  They would decimate much of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports to the UK.  EU tariffs on supply chain imports from the UK to Ireland, such as the 130 million glass bottles purchased by the Irish spirits industry from the UK, would lead to cost competitiveness challenges for Irish food and drink producers.  To support businesses during a hard Brexit, alleviation measures will be needed to support Irish industry.  Tariffs flow back to central exchequers at national and EU level and must be recycled into a tariff stabilisation fund to offset serious damage to exports and job losses.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, a temporary EU state aid framework to support companies through any adjustment period, with funds amounting to 5% of the value of current annual export sales to the UK, will be needed annually for three years from domestic and EU sources to help Irish companies innovate, diversify into new markets, train staff and invest for the future in capital towards enabling technology, carbon efficiency, plant renewal and expansion geared to improve competitiveness.  Measures are also needed to ensure landbridge access to continental Europe and the provision of sufficient capacity on direct sea routes.<br\/><br\/>A no-deal exit would deliver a major shock to the rural economy.  Those most vulnerable to job losses already live in areas with fewer opportunities, a lack of other viable employment and lower incomes.  The companies most exposed are both capital intensive and low margin.  If firms collapse in a no-deal scenario, they will not be easily replaced.  Decisive and far-reaching Government intervention would be required to protect jobs and to support vulnerable but viable firms from day one.  The risk of no deal remains imminent and action is required, including the following important steps.  To save viable but vulnerable companies in trouble, we need to reintroduce an enhanced enterprise stabilisation fund, in the same vein as was available during the financial crisis in 2009.  To maintain jobs in viable but vulnerable firms where short-time work is not possible, we need to introduce an employment subsidy scheme.  To assist with cashflow in small and medium enterprises, SMEs, we need to accelerate the current SME credit guarantee scheme&rsquo;s coverage.  Finally, to help companies diversify, we need to introduce a new scheme for export credit insurance aimed at companies affected by Brexit and at diversifying them away from the UK market.<br\/><br\/>Timing, in this regard, is of the essence.  Our experience from 2009 shows that it took up to ten months from agreement on a state aid framework at a European level until companies could draw down supports.  In a no-deal scenario, if supports were not available until the middle of 2020, it would be far too late to sustain enterprises and jobs in many areas.  It is imperative we introduce legislation and have structures in place to administer the schemes as soon as possible.  The measures could be partly funded by new tariffs that will have to be levied on Irish imports from the UK.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the deal scenario.  Last week&rsquo;s political agreement between the EU and the UK has much to commend it, not least relative to the catastrophic implications of no deal.  It includes far-reaching and vital provisions to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the common travel area, provides a <i>status quo<\/i>transition period and allows talks to move on to the future EU-UK relationship.  Nevertheless, Brexit was always an exercise in damage limitation.  The new deal goes some way towards mitigating the potential risks to the all-island economy and supply chains but we will inevitably end up in a worse place than where we are now.<\/p><p>The deal means Northern Ireland will be subject to preferential, but potentially complex, new customs arrangements.  Meanwhile, the political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship is far less ambitious than Mrs. Theresa May's previous deal.  This could have significant negative economic implications in due course.  We have also been left burdened with tight, over-optimistic timelines to agree a future trade deal, which do not reflect business realities.<\/p><p> Any future trading relationship, unless it involves continuing membership of the Single Market and customs union, which it will not, will be sub-optimal to the current arrangements.  The extent of tariff and non-tariff barriers faced by agrifood and drink products imported into Ireland is clearly illustrated in the graph included in our submission.  That comes from a report published by the ESRI in July 2018.  The report was commissioned by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  While exports to the UK would face a different tariff regime, tariffs and non-tariff barriers would be similarly prohibitive.  A future trading relationship may or may not result in reduced or zero tariffs, but many other non-tariff barriers and hence costs would remain.  The graph clearly shows a strong correlation between tariffs and non-tariff barriers - the higher the tariffs, the higher the non-tariff barriers will be.  Typically, one finds agrifood products near the top of the graph.<\/p><p> Copenhagen Economics, in a February 2018 report commissioned by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, quantified the impacts on Irish goods exports across various scenarios and these are summarised in the next graph.  It quantified the impacts across a range of sectors including the three most exposed food subsectors, which are processed foods, beef and sheep meat and dairy.  Looking at each of the scenarios, processed food exports to the UK by 2030 would be 45% below the non-Brexit baseline in a FTA scenario.  For beef and sheep meat exports to the UK, it estimated they would be 28% below the 2030 non-Brexit baseline level in a FTA scenario.  Dairy exports would be 37% below the 2030 non-Brexit baseline in a FTA scenario.  I will not go through the detail, but members can see in the statement the percentages for the various other scenarios, that is, customs union only, EEA and WTO.  All of those are significantly more negative compared to where we are now.<\/p><p> Copenhagen Economics also quantified the impacts on production and employment in each sector and repeatedly highlighted that regulatory divergence, specifically common EU regulation on food safety standards, food inspection requirements and common labelling requirements, was the main factor affecting exports.  Any future trading relationship will, therefore, still be challenging for the food and drink sector and will require substantial Brexit mitigation measures, such as a temporary state aid framework, enterprise stabilisation, employment subsidies, SME cash flow and market diversification, as I outlined earlier for the no-deal scenario. <\/p><p> The retention of free access to, and maintenance of the value of, the UK market are of critical importance.  Any future FTA must include the following elements.  All sides must commit to negotiate an ambitious and balanced agreement that prioritises continued tariff and barrier free trade, long-term growth, investment and stability.  We must avoid tariffs or other import quota regimes between both parties.  There must be the establishment of a mechanism that will facilitate keeping EU and UK food standards under the scope of veterinary legislation as well as under food and drink law in general as closely aligned as possible.  We need the introduction of a mutually acceptable food inspection system regarding imports from third countries.  Ensuring a continued close relationship between the UK and the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, is key to continued future alignment of food and drink standards.  The objective must be continuing joint risk assessment with a common database to minimise divergence in standards and avoid trade impediments.  A similar objective applies to animal health, welfare and the environment.  Transitional arrangements of sufficient length for businesses to plan and prepare for any new FTA arrangements will be required to bridge the gap until the future EU-UK agreement enters into force.<\/p><p> The necessary measures to respond to Brexit can be summarised as follows: additional support measures for agrifood and drink in the event of both no deal and deal, particularly in the areas of exceptional state aid supports, market diversification and market access; a comprehensive and frictionless future trading relationship; regulatory convergence, not regulatory divergence; a transition period of sufficient duration.<\/p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to attend and welcome any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1533,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

My question is a follow-up to the Chairman's.  Even if we got our wish list relating to Brexit, we are still dependent on how markets gauge it and sterling can respond by either strengthening or weakening.  It is something we always had prior to Brexit, but it was not as unstable as it is now.  How can we insulate against that into the future, even if we get what is seen as favourable from Mr. Kelly's perspective for his companies?  How can we insulate against how the market reacts to sterling?<\/p> <p>  Second, will Mr. Kelly go into further detail on how he sees the landbridge working, especially for perishable goods?

I had to meet a group visiting the House.  We discussed this in the previous session in more depth and I will just reference it now, but there is an enormous sectoral problem within the overall agriculture and food sector.  There is a problem in the beef sector.  This sector is strongly linked to the UK economy.  There is a difficult situation in the context of Brexit, but the beef sector is particularly threatened and in difficulty now.  Will Mr. Kelly comment on that?  Apart from subventing farmers with direct payments, are there steps that are not being taken currently to maximise the marketing and sales of our beef and the way we present it?  Where does he see the threats to the price now?  We are aware of the fluctuation in sterling, and the potential of a no-deal Brexit was enormous.  However, leaving that aside, are we adjusting properly to the issues with beef, beef sales and the type of market that exists for beef?<\/p> <p>  The reason I am going on about this all day is that I met the protesting farmers on three nights for an hour each night.  I sat with them, talked to them and listened to their stories.  People might talk about the efficacy of their protest or otherwise, but that is a different debate.  The important matters in this context are the hardship, the levels of poverty, the threat to their business and the fact that they will not be fit to be primary producers for much longer, which presents its own problem.<\/p><p>How do the organisations see the marketing of beef, new products and research addressed?  Have they any kind of a strategy to get over that?  Our guests may have elucidated these points in my absence.  If they did, I apologise.  However, this is a real issue for families.  Many of them were actually prepared to give me documentary evidence on the nights I met them.  I did not accept it but I know anecdotally any small farmer with beef as a major component of his or her income is supplementing it with money from an outside job.  Either that or it is not sustainable.  These farmers should not be subventing their farming incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#L00400","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1537,"content":"<p>The impact has been significant uncertainty, which has made it difficult for businesses to deal with it.  It was quite noticeable, particularly for the medium to larger-sized companies, that once they got over the initial shock, they went into project-management and problem-solving mode.  It was approached as a significant business problem.  The approach taken was to look at in a structured fashion.  Initially, this was done on the basis that there would be some form of a withdrawal deal and then a move into the 21-month transition period.  Nobody saw this as good for the reasons I outlined earlier, namely, all Brexit outcomes are bad outcomes.  Businesses were planning on this basis.  As soon as we ran into all the political difficulties around the withdrawal agreement, the level of uncertainty increased dramatically.  That caused quite a number of problems for companies in terms of their planning and what they needed to do.  The closer they were to market, the more they had to invest large sums of money in terms of stockpiling.  Stockpiling brings a whole range of concerns and costs.  It means that one must interfere with production efficiencies because one might be bringing people in for extra shifts.  There are costs associated with that.  Then one has to hire warehousing space and additional working capital is tied up as a result.  This happened or is due to happen on several occasions, namely, 29 March, 12 April, 31 October and now, potentially, 31 January.  All of this is taking place during some seasonally important parts of the year for different sectors of the industry.  Companies have just had to deal with that.  In terms of some their long-term planning, it has impaired much investment by businesses.  On the other hand, it certainly made many of them begin to work on market diversification.  Where the UK was an easy market to work, if that was their sole market, they would have expanded into other markets as well.<\/p> <p>  We have our own cost competitiveness index that we use to measure the broad cost environment in which companies are operating.  We exclude raw materials from that because they are priced generally, regionally or internationally.  The second thing we measure is currencies.  What we found was that, since 2015, for companies selling into the UK market, their cost competitiveness deteriorated by 30%.  Of that, 10% was due to a rising cost base in Ireland caused by a hot economy to put it mildly.  The other 20% has been due to the depreciation of sterling.  It has come back a little bit but that is what companies have faced.  That has had significant impacts back along the supply chain.<\/p> <p>  Some of our focus in our submission to the committee and in our pre-budget submission has been what can be done to support companies to make them more cost competitive.  From the Government, we see various initiatives such as the lean manufacturing scheme.  They need to be supplemented by more state aid supports in terms of capital investment in companies to ensure they can bring more efficiencies to the manufacturing processes and lower the cost of production.  Over the longer term, there is nothing we can do about currency.  We are part of the eurozone and the UK has a different currency.  Companies have to deal with that but we want to be able to deal with it from Ireland rather than transferring manufacturing operations to the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1538,"content":"<p>Sterling should increase in value now, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#M00300","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1539,"content":"<p>We would hope to see that.  We have seen it come from 91p back to 86p or 87p.  It stayed at that level over the past week.  If we move into much more political certainty and get the withdrawal agreement over the line, there should be an improvement.  The extent of the improvement remains to be seen.  What is becoming clearer is that, while there is relief or the potential of relief that this revised protocol may hopefully be ratified by the UK Parliament and then by the European Parliament, the future trading relationship will look like a hard Brexit.  That is not going to be particularly beneficial economically for the UK and certainly will not be for us.  There are several points traders will need to digest.  We should see further improvements in the exchange rate.  The extent of it, however, remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>  Regarding insulating against the marketplace, it is down to how to make Irish businesses more competitive.  This comes back to improving skills, improving innovation and more capital investment in businesses.  In the period of uncertainty in which we remain, the big capital investments are difficult decisions for many companies to make at this stage.  Product and market diversification into the rest the EU and third countries is another point.  There will be different target markets depending on the part of the food sector involved.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the landbridge, as it stands, the fresher one&rsquo;s produce and the shorter shelf life it has, the more compelling it is to use the landbridge.  For some companies whose produce tends to be more ambient or frozen, as well as those with longer supply lines, the direct sea route may be an improving option.  Companies are looking at this and doing test runs on the direct route.  Ultimately, it will boil down to how the Dover-Calais pinch point will actually work.<\/p> <p>  Many of the main concerns relate to a no-deal Brexit, which would be disorganised and chaotic.  If we have a transition period of sufficient duration, which effectively will be business as usual, and if we can then move on to an organised free-trade agreement environment, we should see a lessening of the concerns about landbridge.  There is one proviso, however.  If the UK is outside the customs union, we will still face substantial customs administration.  That customs administration will impose costs on businesses, both in terms of paperwork and delays.  The form those delays will take remains to be seen.  They will not be as bad as a chaotic no-deal Brexit.  However, there will be checks at all the relevant borders.  As we progress through this and as the free-trade agreement starts to take shape, we will be able to assess the impact on the landbridge and make decisions at that point.<\/p> <p>  On the specific issues raised by Senator O'Reilly in respect of the beef sector, there is a beef task force agreement.  One hopes that it will get the opportunity to hold its first meeting in due course.  That is the route for the entire sector to address these issues.<\/p><p>Overhanging everything, however, are some fundamental issues with a weak UK market and the sterling issue, which I mentioned earlier.  Having said that, there was very good news on market diversification earlier this week with the announcement of 14 additional beef plants gaining access to the Chinese market.  It is worth acknowledging the efforts of all of the industry, particularly the market access efforts.  It is also worth acknowledging the resources the Department has devoted to this.  There has been a widening of the market, and that will be important.  A lot more work will need to be done on market diversification.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the point regarding the number of the regions whose economic outputs are below the Irish average.  Senator Mulherin alluded to this in the earlier session.  The regions in question are the most exposed.  We have touched on this briefly in our statement and in some of our earlier analysis of the exceptional case for state aid.  It very easily points to the fact that a number of these regions are exposed economically and will need support.  It would certainly be the case in a no-deal scenario but we argue that, as the deal is currently framed, many of those supports will still be needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1541,"content":"<p>Will the transition period, if and when we get to it, involve more of the same in terms of uncertainty, or will the companies might view it with a little more positivity and move on to their next phases of development, which some have been shelving because of uncertainty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#N00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571785200,"counter":1542,"content":"<p>The transition period, as currently framed, will last until the end of 2020.  Based on the developments over the past 24 hours, we could see the extension until the end of January 2020, which will leave an 11-month transition period that is totally insufficient.  Everybody is well aware that free trade negotiations take many years.  There are a couple of points to bear in mind on the United Kingdom.  They were also alluded to in the first session.  There are a number of sensitive topics over and beyond agrifood.  In any free trade agreement negotiations, agrifood tends to be one of the major stumbling blocks, resulting in significant delays.  Many of the level playing pitch issues surrounding matters such as state aid, competition law, employment legislation and labour legislation may be contentious and will, I believe, result in the negotiations continuing for a significant period.  Unless there is certainty on a transition period of sufficient duration to address these sorts of issues, therefore, it will result in considerable uncertainty for businesses.  As it stands, looking at the transition period in isolation, it is a matter of business as usual.  Most businesses, however, operate over a timeframe measured in years rather than months.  They, therefore, need certainty measured in years rather than months in which to do their business properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":1543,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions and for addressing all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019102300002#N00400","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571785200,"counter":1544,"content":"<p>The select committee went into private session at 3.45 p.m. and adjourned at 4.10 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
