I was disappointed, and nearly angry, to see these amendments ruled out of order.  The Bill is about the rights and interests of a child, which is why the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, GAL, system was put in place in the first instance.  This is particularly the case at the moment, where social workers change regularly and many children do not have social workers for long periods.  In many cases, the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is basically the child's right-hand person.  If we are saying that we will not allow for guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>in all circumstances, the Bill is hypocritical.<\/p><p>I have a major issue with the fact that it was 6.30 p.m. yesterday when we were told that the amendments had been ruled out of order.  That is very short notice to allow us to prepare for today.  The ruling undermines the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to provide for a discussion on the matter so that we might find a way of getting around it.  Amendment No. 2 in particular is important, but it has been ruled out of order.  I would like to see us doing something about the matter it addresses and amending the Bill on Report Stage.  Otherwise, we in my party will be reserving the right to vote against the Bill on Report Stage.  It is contradictory and hypocritical and does not protect the best interests of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#B00300","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will echo what my colleagues have said.  It is unusual for three Opposition Deputies to work together and submit amendments.  We obviously felt strongly on this issue, given that we submitted three joint amendments.  We did so because we believed we would be facilitating, supporting and strengthening the Bill.  Ruling them out of order will leave the Bill weak, and the people who will be most affected are the children in the childcare system.  I ask that the Minister consider what we have submitted.  Deputy Funchion cited one amendment in particular, but what we speak about in our amendments goes to the core of the issue, namely, ensuring that every child has access to a GAL regardless of postcode lotteries or the level of the court system he or she is in.  The child might not need a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, but he or she would have had the opportunity to decline one.  Another amendment would have protected the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>by providing him or her access to legal advice.<\/p><p>That is where we were coming from with our amendments.

That is the normal procedure.  The Deputy was advised by email last night, through the secretariat.  That is the normal procedure.  We will get to it.  The Minister has indicated her position.

As I am sure the members are aware, it would require the District Court to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in all childcare proceedings and would enable the court to discharge that order where the child makes a request to that effect.  Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in every case before the District Court would entail a significant increase in the cost to the State.  Amendment No. 3 is consequential to amendment No. 1.  The amendments must therefore be ruled out of order as they would create a charge on the revenue, in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).  That is the advice that has been given.

I thank the Chair for sharing that advice.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because I do not agree that the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem <\/i>should mandatory in every case.  That opinion is shared by many stakeholders who have engaged with us, including Dr. Carol Coulter, who as the Deputy knows is the director of the Child Care Law Reporting Project.  I have also discussed this with my officials at length.  To tease out why that would be the case I will propose some hypothetical situations in which it might not always be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.  <\/i>One example would be a non-contentious case where a child is already in care, either with relatives or in general foster care, and where this is being formalised by a care order.  Another example might be the case of a vulnerable parent, in which voluntary care may not be appropriate.  The proceedings may be about formalising care by relatives.  That is an example in which it might not be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Another example might concern an older child, who might not want yet another professional to be assigned to him or her.  An older child may request to speak to the judge directly, perhaps accompanied by his or her social worker.  Those are examples where in my opinion it may not be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.  <\/i>Therefore the Bill should not stipulate that it is mandatory to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Of course guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>do very valuable work, but in many cases it is important to provide flexibility.  We must recognise that they are not the only way for a child to have his or her views and best interests represented in every set of circumstances.  I expect the Deputies would agree with that.<\/p><p>The provisions relating to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem <\/i>must be read in conjunction with the additional obligations the Bill places on the court through the greatly expanded section 24, with which I know Deputies are familiar.  That new section removes the reference to parents' rights and responsibilities and clearly states, &quot;the court shall regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration in the resolution of any such proceedings&quot;.  It includes a long list of factors that the court must consider when determining what is in the best interests of the child.  It also inserts a new section 24A, which provides:<\/p><blockquote>... the court, in so far as practicable shall&mdash;(a) determine the means by which to facilitate the expression by the child of his or her views in the proceedings, and<br \/><br \/>(b) give such views as the child wishes to express due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/blockquote> <p>Taken together, these provisions place a heavy duty on the court to hear the views of children who are the subject of care proceedings, to give those views due weight and to fully consider a long list of factors during its consideration of what is in the child's best interests.<\/p><p>The judge in childcare proceedings has an overarching responsibility to vindicate the rights of the child, including his or her fair procedure rights.  The authors of Child Care Proceedings: A Thematic Review of Irish and International Practice, research commissioned by my Department, outlined other mechanisms used in other jurisdictions to hear the views of the child.  Those include a meeting between the child and the judge, the child providing the court with a personal letter, video or drawing, the child responding to a questionnaire and the child communicating his or her views through his or her social worker.<\/p><p>I do not want to constrain the courts if they have a better way of doing something for a particular child.  I am also mindful of the planned reform of the family courts and hope that in the future there may be other approaches to hearing a child's view more directly and representing his or her best interests.  Amendments including the one proposed by Deputy Rabbitte acknowledge that a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is not always needed.  The amendment suggests that when a child does not want one to be appointed to him or her, the child's views should be respected.  My provision provides that when considering whether to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem, <\/i>the court should consider the views of the child on whether or not he or she should have one.  Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to every single child, even children who have already expressed the view that they do not want one, forces a child to reject a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>once one is appointed.<\/p><p>That would be disrespectful to an articulate young person who has already made his or her views known to the court.  I feel it would make more sense not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>if a child does not want one in the first instance.  That is in the Bill as it stands.  I also believe that adding an extra layer to proceedings by requiring a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to be appointed and then dismissed, because he or she is not needed, would undo a lot of the good work we are trying to do.  We want a new guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system to reduce complications and delays and not add to them.  The Bill is an effort to bring about a recalibration of our statutory landscape in which the child is placed front and centre.  I know members agree with that principle, even if they have different views on this particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#C03800","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Members can come in on the section but we cannot debate amendments that have been ruled out of order.

It is important to emphasise that, as matters stand, a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, GAL, is not a party, and has never been a party.  It is at the court&rsquo;s discretion that they are sometimes allowed to exercise party-type rights.  That is an important distinction but it emphasises that discretion resides with the court to allow the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to work for the child&rsquo;s best interests.  It is important to acknowledge the overarching responsibility of the judge in the case is to vindicate the rights of the child and to behave proportionately in the interests of the child, and that there is no fundamental impediment to vindication of the fair procedure rights of the child in an arrangement where the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is not a party to the proceedings.<\/p><p>This provision does not remove this discretion but we want to make it clear that, effectively, there is no automatic right for the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to act as a party.  This Bill sets out a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>role that is based on the Children&rsquo;s Acts Advisory Board 2009 guidance.  Its core functions are to ascertain the views of the child and to make recommendations to the court on what is in the best interests of the child.  Party status does not sit well with this role as an independent resource appointed to ascertain the views of the child and make recommendations to the court.  I would like to emphasise that the child can be made a party under the Child Care Act, as it stands, and, under this Bill, a child who is a party can also have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  It is the child, not the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, who has a personal interest in the case, so I believe this is the most appropriate route for those children who want to, and for whom it is in their best interest to, be joined as a party.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#H00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I have had regard to public interventions.  In one case, a solicitor of long standing who is operating in Cork, Mr. Colm Roberts, is on the public record as part of process of interrogating and examining the role of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  He stated in a recent presentation:<\/p><blockquote>In 2009 I raised my concern in another child care case before the District Court in Cork as I believed that as a legal advisor for parents, I was at a disadvantage in cases where the extent and role of the Gal was unclear, and particularly the extent and role of his\/her legal representation was even more unsettling as it seemed to move the Gal into a more adversarial role.<br \/><br \/>This particularly became more acute in circumstances where the Gal was supporting the application for Care Orders by the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency (previously HSE).  This is very problematic for the Court to balance the right of the Gal to fully participate in proceedings that he\/she has been appointed in and at the same time ensure that natural justice and fairness to all parties is protected and vindicated.  This issue was dealt with in detail [in] a judgment by District judge Mitchell.<\/blockquote> <p>In putting forward the amendment to delete, we want to strike a balance between the presumption in favour of the appointment of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>and the discretion of the District Court in the absence of a fully fledged family courts infrastructure, while seeking to give a voice to the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, which is the voice of the child before the court.  I do not see what is so injurious about our intention to delete these lines.  I am not a lawyer and I have never been a witness before a court, in particular proceedings before the family courts, so I am a layman in this respect.  We are seeking to ensure that voice is absolutely robust in the absence of there being a fully fledged family courts infrastructure.  Again, this goes back to the geographical disparities that exist between certain parties where, without being disrespectful to District Court judges, not every District Court judge has the training in respect of these types of cases that come before them.  Is there a formula of words that would copperfasten the importance of the role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>without necessarily calling for them not to be a party?

There is a lamentable absence of comprehensive, quantifiable data about childcare proceedings in Ireland.  The childcare law reporting project's valuable work has provided a window into those proceedings but we are still lacking reliable quantifiable data on childcare cases.  It is my intention that the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>office will endeavour to provide information on its activities, while respecting the important privacy protections provided by the <i>in camera<\/i>rule and GDPR.  I am happy to consider bringing forth an amendment to provide for the publication of an annual report.  I will consult the Attorney General's office on the appropriate wording.  <\/p><p>I take this opportunity to advise Deputies that I also intend to bring forward two amendments on Report Stage to the <i>in camera<\/i>rule under section 29 of the Child Care Act.  As I have mentioned, the childcare law reporting project provides a valuable window into these proceedings, but there is currently no expressed basis for Department officials to attend proceedings.  This creates difficulties for the Department in terms of monitoring the implementation of the 1991 Act and the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>executive office into the future.  While I recognise the importance of the <i>in camera<\/i>rule for the protection of the privacy of children and their families, I am also conscious of the seriousness of State intervention in family life under the 1991 Act and the obligation for legislation and policy to be informed by evidence from our courts.  I have secured Government approval for an amendment to section 29 of the 1991 Act to authorise the attendance of two specific groups of officials, including those who will have official responsibility for managing guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and those who will have a specific role in monitoring the implementation of the 1991 in order to revise and improve it.  <\/p><p>The second proposed amendment will enable the childcare law reporting project and other similar bodies to exercise their functions properly by ensuring that they have access to all relevant reports.  I emphasise that these proposed amendments will not impact on the court's ability to restrict access to the court on a case-by-case basis but nor will they impact on the court's ability to restrict access to court documents, if desired, in the specific circumstances of a particular case.  Furthermore, no person will be permitted to make public information likely to lead members of the public to identify either a party to the proceedings or a child to whom proceedings relate.  Additionally, I am considering the possibility of introducing a provision which would allow for a review of the reformed guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>arrangements under this Bill.

I was genuinely disappointed that amendment No. 2, which went to the heart of the Bill, was ruled out of order.  It spoke to the reason the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system exists in the first instance.  I understand and accept the point the Minister has made about a child who might not want to have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>or about straightforward cases in which there is no need for a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  We allowed for that in amendment No. 2, which stated: &quot;The District Court may discharge an order directing the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, on the application of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, if the child so requests.&quot;  We understand that the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is not necessary in certain cases.  In other cases, the child does not want a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to be appointed.  We think it would be better to say from the start to every child in care that he or she has a right and an entitlement to a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  If we are genuinely interested in representing children, being the voice of children and ensuring the interests and rights of children are heard, listened to and respected, this is the crux of the matter.  I find it very difficult to support this legislation without this amendment being factored into it.  That is why I asked earlier if there is any way of looking at this issue in advance of Report Stage.  I would appreciate it if such a way could be found.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  If we cannot find a compromise or a solution in this respect, I will vote against the Bill on Report Stage and I will advise my party colleagues to do likewise.  It is hypocritical to state that we want this system to be in place to ensure children in care are protected, while at the same time saying that not every child in care will get a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  It is definite that children will fall through the cracks.  In years to come, cases will be taken against the State by people who feel they should have been given a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>but no such opportunity was provided to them.  While I understand what has been said about the cost to the Exchequer, the issue goes beyond that.  I found it difficult to go through the rest of the Bill after this amendment was ruled out of order.  This aspect of it is the heart of the matter for me.  I will wait to see whether it is rectified in advance of Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#N02800","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her time.  As stated earlier when she was not present, there is a great deal of good in the Bill.  We have focused on one section of the Bill in our amendments.  It is important to acknowledge that there is a lot of good stuff in the Bill.  Most of the amendments that have been proposed relate to section 6.  I have met officials from her Department.  I would welcome another meeting if that could be facilitated.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock, who said that this is about the language.  I firmly believe there is a wording that could be used.  Like the Minister, I am a purist.  There are certain things we believe.  I am a purist when it comes to my belief that every child should have the opportunity to avail of the services of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>if those services are needed or if he or she chooses to avail of those services.  We have discussed children who do not want to have the opportunity to avail of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Every child who finds himself or herself in these circumstances should have the opportunity to have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Maybe we can meet somewhere to discuss that further.  I do not want the Report Stage debate to happen without everything having been teased out in its entirety.  I would like to see the Bill passed.  I would like to think that common ground can be found.  When I arrive at a committee meeting, I do not like to feel, as I did today, that another move is taking place without the committee having had enough time to address it.  While I thank the Minister for flagging what she has just presented to us, I emphasise that a great deal of discussion needs to take place before we get to Report Stage.  We need to find a solution.

She said that sometimes young children, particularly teenagers, may not want a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.

All children should be given the opportunity to have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  I think we are losing sight of what this Bill is about.  It is about children's interests.  We all sit here and say a social worker can do this.  A social worker cannot, and I speak from experience regarding the service of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Sometimes children are sick to their back teeth of talking to officials, and they see social workers as officials.  They see their carers and their parents and they are caught in the middle, but the guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are their voice.  I know this from experience because I have heard children ask, when they would not discuss something with a social worker, for such and such to be called because that person was the child's voice.

I thank the Minister and her officials for their attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#O02400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1571785200,"counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#O02450"},{"type":"speech","time":1571785200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>The Select Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has completed its consideration of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2019 and has made amendments thereto.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019102300002#O02600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571785200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 11.48 a.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
