In the 2019\/2020 school year there were over 14,200 children on Special Educational Needs (SEN) school transport - an increase of 4,982 children since 2013.  My Department funded the School Transport Scheme in 2019 in the amount of just over &euro;219m, with 53% of this having been allocated to spend on the transport scheme for children with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the SEN Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the scheme children are eligible for transport where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability and are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class\/special school or  unit, that is or can be resourced, to meet their special educational needs.    <\/p>  <p>  Where practicable my Department will consider, the provision of specific or individual transport arrangements in circumstances where travel in the company of other children is not deemed feasible.

This funding will provide each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week, and release days for Deputy Principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal for this school year.  More than 1,700 primary schools with teaching principals have benefitted from the increase in release days.  <\/p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has a mainstream staffing of a Principal and 5 mainstream class teachers.

In this year's budget, more than 20% of the total Education Budget or &euro;2bn will be invested in supporting children with special needs, an increase from &euro;1.9bn last year.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. While progress has been achieved, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special class and special school places in South Dublin for the current school-year. <\/p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  <\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.<\/p>  <p>  A Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with Section 37A (2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted to the then Minister in April last. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record.<\/p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the legislative process which is currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400066#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400066#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[29981\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400066#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of negotiations to secure a site in Buncrana, County Donegal, for new school campuses for schools (details supplied).","asker":"1463","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the acquisition of a suitable site to provide new school accommodation has proved to be extremely challenging to date.

Over the coming weeks, Bus &Eacute;ireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on each individual route. <\/p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  As well as additional funding, significant numbers of additional vehicles, drivers and bus escorts will be required.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is implementing different means of providing extra capacity with existing operators, including upgrading vehicles, additional runs or additional vehicles being provided.  Where additional services will need to be procured, Bus &Eacute;ireann has put in place a framework of operators that are willing to provide additional services where required.  <\/p>  <p>  An analysis has been conducted to determine what is required to fully implement all post-primary school services to operate at 50% capacity.  The estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts. <\/p>  <p>  Further detailed planning is being done through the local offices on a route by route basis to plan appropriate measures to provide the additional capacity required.  As the additional capacity is rolled out, where spare capacity is created, further tickets will be allocated  to those children eligible for the scheme who have paid late and for other applicants seeking concessionary tickets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400067#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400067#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[25990\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400067#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the new ASD unit will open in a school (details supplied); the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>The school building project to which the Deputy refers was approved funding under the Additional Accommodation Scheme 2019 to enable the school to build a two classroom SEN base.  <\/p>  <p>  The project has been devolved for delivery to Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB (DDLETB) and a Design Team has been appointed to lead this project.

NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. While progress has been achieved, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special class and special school places in South Dublin for the current school-year. <\/p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  <\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.<\/p>  <p>  A Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with Section 37A (2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted to the then Minister in April last. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record.<\/p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the legislative process which is currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400068#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400068#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[29992\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400068#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of leaving certificate students that have had their leaving certificate grades upgraded as a result of a review to the calculated grade system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>On 03 October I announced that improved Calculated Grades would issue that day to  students who received lower Calculated Grades than they should have, as a result of errors that were found in the Calculated Grades process. <\/p><p>As a result of rectification of these errors, a total of 6,100 students received higher calculated grades.

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. <\/p>  <p>  On 30 September, I made a statement advising that two errors had been identified in the Calculated Grades process. These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. <\/p>  <p>  The first error, in one out of 50,000 lines of code, was in relation to the processing of Junior Cycle data. The system was meant to draw on the core Junior Cycle subjects of English, Irish and Maths, and combine them with the students&rsquo; 2 best non-core subjects for all of the students in each class in each school. The coding error instead combined the core subjects with the students&rsquo; 2 weakest non-core subjects.<\/p>  <p>  The error meant that, in some subjects, some students received Calculated Grades that were lower than they should have been, while some students received grades that were higher than they should have been. <\/p>  <p>  In the course of a review which the Department then undertook, Departmental staff found a further error in the section of the code dealing with Junior Cycle results. The Junior Cycle subject Civil, Social and Political Education (CSPE) was meant to be disregarded as part of the model but was not. This second error, however, had a negligible impact on results.<\/p>  <p>  At that stage I decided to seek independent expert oversight in the interest of certainty, particularly for our students.

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.   In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    <\/p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. <\/p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400069#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400069#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[30283\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400069#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the fairness of putting some secondary school secretaries on short-term contracts; her views on the low salary scale they are on and the issues they face regarding pension entitlements; if she will clarify her position to those due to engage in industrial action; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>I am keenly aware of the vital role contributed by school secretaries within school communities and I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. <\/p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor insurance cover and what terms to apply.  For example, factors may include the drivers age; relevant driving experience; the age and type of vehicle; how and where the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; the storage location; and the use of telematics. Insurers also price quotations in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. In the case of taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the taxi business, which involves driving for hire or reward extensively and in their view this has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result.  Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.  It is also my understanding that the number of underwriters providing cover in the taxi market in Ireland has increased in recent years and therefore there are more competitive offerings to the taxi community. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy in relation to the precise query asked, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in Ireland.  They stated that if on occasion a taxi operator is encountering difficulties securing a quotation, the Insurance Ireland information service is available at feedback@insuranceireland.eu to policy holders or those seeking motor insurance.  They also stated that if a policyholder was to encounter this issue with their insurance provider, the Declined Cases Agreement would come into force.  They believe that this process will facilitate a quotation to be released for the nominated driver, with the consent of the policyholder.  In that regard, the email address for such queries is declined@insuranceireland.eu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400072#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400072#WRH03100"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[30616\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400072#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will exempt green diesel used by farmers and farm contractors from carbon tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>As I outlined yesterday in my Budget speech, I have increased the rate of carbon tax from &euro;26 euro per tonne of Carbon Dioxide emission to &euro;33.50 per tonne.

Further orders were signed on 16 April 2020 and 9 May 2020, the last of which expired on 23 May 2020.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The oversight and management of the lists of qualified households awaiting accommodation, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with Sections 20 and 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment and Allocation Regulations, respectively. Under Regulation 28 of the Assessment Regulations, a household&rsquo;s qualification for support may be reviewed at the discretion of a local authority and Regulation 29 provides that the household&rsquo;s qualification for support shall be reassessed at the point of allocation of support.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.

It is crucial that we support the wellbeing of our students and school management and staff in order to support successful re-engagement with teaching and learning.  We know that most students, and indeed their families and school staff were looking forward to going back, reconnecting with school, reconnecting with staff and friends and settling back into school work. This has been a time of change, with new rules and routines to be learned, in order to keep everyone safe. Some students may have felt anxious about the return to school. In times of change some worry or anxiety is a normal response. Most by now will have settled and re-engaged with little difficulty after an initial settling in period. <\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities. The response to supporting the wellbeing of all within school communities on the return to school required a structured, compassionate, psychosocial response with a largely preventative and proactive focus.  This required a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and was based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  <\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some students and their families may need additional support for wellbeing and to settle back into school that is in addition to the universal wellbeing supports being provided for all students. Schools have been supported with this response by the provision of a range of further guidance and support from my Department&rsquo;s Psychological Support Service, NEPS, by the Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) and with support from HSE Services, including access to e-mental health services.  NEPS psychologists now have an increased focus on both consultation and casework in schools with particular attention to the needs of individual students.  Psychologists are providing a blended approach to the provision of casework to schools, working both remotely, and where appropriate in-school, depending of the nature of need.  As part of a package of measures to support the reopening of our schools the provision of an additional seventeen psychologist posts to NEPS was announced bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole time equivalent psychologist posts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400074#WRK02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400074#WRK02900"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[25851\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400074#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the adequacy of the school transport system to cater for schoolchildren and the ability to social distance adequately on school buses; her further views on the adequacy of the preparations made to deal with the demand; her further views on the inability of some families to get access for children to local school buses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":419,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  In the 2019\/2020 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  School Transport Scheme services for the 2020\/2021 school year commenced operation on the 26th August 2020.

The arrangements include the following provisions: <\/p><p>- 2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  <\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  <\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>Schools were expected to review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. <\/p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November, subject to public health advice. <\/p>  <p>  The marking of the November examinations will rely principally on the expert judgment of the Chief Examiner and members of the senior examining team in the State Examinations Commission (SEC) based on the content of the examination papers and the demands of the marking scheme. This expert judgment approach will ensure that the standards applied in the marking of these examinations will be fair and valid for these candidates, who form a small subset of the overall candidature for Leaving Certificate 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate candidates sitting the written examinations in November who opted to receive Calculated Grades will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written examination.<\/p>  <p>  2020 Applicants to the CAO will have their final Leaving Certificate results forwarded to the CAO, using their best results of examinations and Calculated Grades, where applicable. They will receive any relevant CAO offers that their results indicate, as a deferred offer for 2021\/22. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education have worked closely with the higher education institutions to increase the number of third level places available for incoming first years, for all CAO applicants.

In recognition of the vital role played by youth work in providing such support to young people, funding levels have been maintained throughout the current challenging period.  This has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.  <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value both to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400079#WRP04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Sector","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400080#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[30620\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400080#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the way in which his Department plans to address high levels of staff turnover in the early years education sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>I am acutely aware that many services continue to report difficulties both recruiting and retaining qualified staff. The most recent data, from Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report 2018\/2019, indicates a staff turnover rate of 23% which, despite an improvement on the previous year, is unsustainably high. I have met with employee and employer representatives on a number of occasions and have listened to their concerns, including on staff turnover.<\/p>  <p>  The key challenge to retaining staff is undoubtedly wages and working conditions. Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The most recent data indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff to improve levels of staff retention. I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. Recent measures that have been taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on a formulating a new funding model for the sector which may assist in improving pay, and therefore staff turnover in the sector. In addition, work is under way to develop a Workforce Development Plan, which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector and establish role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and working towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.<\/p>  <p>  I launched an extensive consultation on both the new funding model and the Workforce Development Plan on 19 August. The consultation process includes a call for submissions\/survey, which ran from August to 2 October.

It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. <\/p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>Ireland is moving from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society.

The set of measures in these regulations provides a basic level of protection against possible adverse impacts to waters arising from the agricultural sources. <\/p><p>A review of Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates derogation was undertaken in 2019. The review examined further opportunities for derogation farmers to improve efficiencies and continue to reduce their environmental footprint with particular regard to water, climate, biodiversity and air quality.

One of the conclusions of the review highlighted interalia, that <i>&ldquo;In addition, the Commission has requested Ireland to review some of the technical aspects of the Nitrates Action Programme and ........the annual excretion rates for livestock as per Table 6 of SI 605 2017 be reviewed based on most recent scientific research&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>The current excretion rates for livestock are specified in Table 6 of Schedule 2 (Annex 1) of Statutory Instrument 605 of 2017.

The impact of this change is a 5% increase in the level of livestock manure nitrogen produced by dairy cows in Ireland.

However, as an exceptional measure for 2020, funding was provided for larger towns, including Mullingar, under a new Measure aimed at assisting towns to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19.  The inclusion of larger towns on this occasion was in recognition of their importance in supporting the economic and social fabric of their rural hinterlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101400084#WRU04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"}]
