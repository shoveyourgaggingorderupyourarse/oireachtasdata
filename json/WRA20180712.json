In many instances such efforts are on foot of Ministerial led trade missions.  <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America stood at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017.  The value of trade to these markets has increased by 159% since 2009, and now accounts for over 20% of total agrifood exports.  This growth has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which around &euro;1 billion went to China. Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly.  <\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, my Department maintains a network of agriculture attach&eacute;s which is increasingly focused on countries with whom we are seeking to further develop our trading links, such as the United States of America, the Gulf Region and China. We also work closely with Bord Bia in developing international markets through its network of offices around the world, which it has recently expanded to include a presence in Singapore and in Warsaw.  Indeed I have made some &euro;14.5 million in additional resources available to Bord Bia since the UK referendum in order to assist it with its promotional efforts. <\/p>  <p>  The role of trade missions cannot be underestimated in gaining further market penetration for Irish agri food products to new and existing markets. I led a series of very successful trade missions in 2017 to destinations that included the Gulf States, US, Mexico, Japan and South Korea. In the case of the latter two, this was an ideal opportunity to exploit the benefits to be derived from the EU's recent trade and economic partnership agreements with South Korea and Japan. <\/p>  <p>  This work has continued in 2018. I have already led trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and my Department is currently making arrangements with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for a further trade mission in the last quarter of 2018 to Indonesia and Malaysia. <\/p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access. The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market profiling exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200064#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Subsidies","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200064#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[31485\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200064#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the proposals he has put forward at the European agriculture Council regarding the need to increase the CAP budget post-2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>By way of introduction I would point out that in discussing the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, we should bear in mind that this funding forms part of a broader EU budget which is negotiated by Finance Ministers and then agreed by the European Council and European Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has proposed, as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, that funding for the Common Agricultural Policy should be set at &euro;365 billion.  This would indicate a cut of around 5% for the next MFF period of 2021 - 2027. <\/p>  <p>  The Multiannual Financial Framework sets the budgetary ceilings for the next seven years across a range of headings.  Member State priorities are not identical, and not all member states favour maintaining CAP funding. Furthermore,  in the light of the departure of the UK from the European Union, net contributions to the EU budget will be reduced by approximately &euro;12 billion.  Therefore agreeing an MFF which maintains current levels of CAP funding will be challenging. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless it should be noted that the proposal published by the European Commission is an initial MFF position. The final outcome will be determined by negotiations at EU level over the coming year. Achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations will be a key issue for the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  This MFF proposal will now have to be negotiated by Finance Ministers and agreed by the European Council and Parliament. The intention of the Commission is to reach overall agreement on the MFF before the European Parliamentary Elections in 2019.  Of course the MFF is a critical matter for all Member States and agreement on the MFF requires unanimity amongst all EU Member States.    <\/p>  <p>  I believe that European agriculture policies have delivered for Irish farmers and consumers and it is important that support continues to be provided to these programmes.  Over the next few years farm families will be required to play a vital role in the protection and enhancement of the environment and the production of food to the highest standards in the world. These high standards, and the family farm model, are part of the fabric of European values.  EU citizens have shown that they support this model.  <\/p>  <p>  We need farmers to take active steps to mitigate climate change, protect water quality and biodiversity, and improve their competitiveness. A strong CAP is a prerequisite if these objectives, which are in the best interests of all citizens, are to be achieved. <\/p>  <p>  So while these matters will not ultimately be decided in the Agriculture Council,  I have been working to build consensus among my agriculture colleagues across the European Union to support a reversal of the cuts proposed to the CAP budget.  <\/p>  <p>  Recently in Madrid, I agreed a Memorandum with five of my European colleagues, seeking to maintain CAP funding for the period 2021-2027 at current EU 27 levels.  Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland all signed the Memorandum.  Support has grown for this position and I understand that up to twenty Member States have expressed support for this position. <\/p>  <p>  This work has continued as part of ongoing bilateral meetings.  Since May 2018, I have, together with my colleague Minister Doyle, met with EU Agri Ministers from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Hungary to discuss MFF issues.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to reassure the deputy that I will continue to fight for a strong CAP budget in the upcoming negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200064#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200064#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[31462\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200064#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 23 of 26 April 2018, the number of complaints received through his Department's hotline regarding hunting clubs; the actions that were taken; and his views on whether a more resolute response is needed in view of the number of breaches by hunt clubs and the serious risk to the public.","asker":"1291","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>As you will be aware my Department operates an Animal Welfare Helpline Lo-call  0761 064408  along with a dedicated email address AnimalWelfare@agriculture.gov.ie which facilitates the reporting by members of the public of concerns in regard to the welfare of animals.

The EU points system is designed to complement and not replace national sanctions and ensure a level playing field across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, on 20th March 2018 I signed into force the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2018, S.I.

This was the first opportunity for the EU Agriculture Ministers to discuss  a more in-depth response to the future CAP legislative proposals. All Member States bar the UK intervened in this debate. Proposed cuts to the CAP budget dominated this debate<\/p>  <p>  Recently in Madrid, I agreed a Memorandum, with five of my European colleagues, seeking that CAP funding for 2021 - 27 would not be subject to cuts and would remain at the current level for the 27 EU member states.  Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland all signed the Memorandum.  The declaration against a reduction in expenditure penned by like-minded Member States on May 31 gathering momentum at the June Council meeting. Support has grown for this position and I understand that up to twenty Member States have expressed support for this position.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that European agriculture policies have delivered for Irish farmers and consumers and it is important that support continues to be provided to these programmes.  Over the next few years farm families will be required to play a vital role in the protection and enhancement of the environment and the production of food to the highest standards in the world. These high standards, and the family farm model, are part of the fabric of European values.  EU citizens have shown that they support this model.  <\/p>  <p>  We need farmers to take active steps to mitigate climate change, protect water quality and biodiversity, and improve their competitiveness. A strong CAP is a prerequisite if these objectives, which are in the best interests of all citizens, are to be achieved. <\/p>  <p>  Member States are facing into a difficult negotiation, however, and a number have already indicated that they are not willing to provide additional funding for the MFF. To date Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have stated that they do not wish to increase the MFF and that a smaller budget should be agreed. From Ireland's perspective, the Taoiseach has already indicated that we are prepared to contribute additional funding, but only if critical policies are supported. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the proposal published by the European Commission is the initial MFF proposal. The final outcome will be determined by negotiations at EU level over the coming year. Achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations will be a key issue for the Government. As I Mentioned earlier, ultimately budget decisions are a matter for Finance Ministers , the European Council and the European Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, I have discussed with my counterparts at the EU Agriculture Council the importance of a strong CAP Post 2020 budget.  I will continue to work with my colleagues across Europe on these matters as do my officials.  Since May 2018, Minister Doyle and I have met with the EU Agri Ministers from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Hungary where the CAP Post 2020 Budget was discussed.<\/p>  <p>On the 4th   of July I hosted a Conference on the new CAP legislative proposals for interested stakeholders, including farm bodies, state agencies and the environmental pillar. This was a timely opportunity to bring all interested stakeholders together for a constructive discussion on the future CAP.

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agrifood sector in particular. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I chair the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee involving senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies. The Committee meets quarterly to review progress, as well as engaging with stakeholders on key topics. This collaborative approach has given a strength and depth to the strategic focus of Food Wise 2025, and this will be particularly important in responding to the challenge of Brexit.  I also engage with stakeholders on Brexit-related issues through the Brexit Stakeholder Consultative Committee and the All-Island Civic Dialogue process.  <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 also outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant steps forward have been taken in opening new markets and in developing trade in existing markets for Irish agrifood exporters in the last three years alone.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 Ireland gained access  to the US and Canadian markets for Irish beef.  In the same year we attained access to the Omani market for Irish beef and sheepmeat. In 2016 we gained access to the Maldives for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat. We also gained access to the Iranian market for sheepmeat, and we regained access to the Israeli market for beef. In 2017, the market in Egypt was re-opened to Irish beef and we got access to the Chilean market for Irish pork. The news that we had achieved access to the hugely important Chinese market for beef in April 2018 was of course most welcome. Consumer demand for premium imported beef is forecast to rise significantly, driven by increasing urbanisation, higher disposable incomes and health awareness.  The import of frozen boneless beef, the category for which Ireland will have market access, has grown ninefold within the last five years.<\/p>  <p>  On the dairy front, Ireland exported over &euro;4.5billion in dairy products to nearly 130 countries in 2017. Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada and Japan, which will benefit this sector, my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products. In many instances such efforts are on foot of Ministerial led trade missions.  <\/p>  <p>  It is notable that CSO data for the first quarter of 2018 showed that Irish dairy exports were nearly 10% ahead of the same period in 2016.  This was due to factors such as improving global prices, but also increases in volumes exported across a range of product categories. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America stood at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017.  The value of trade to these markets has increased by 159% since 2009, and now accounts for over 20% of total agrifood exports.  This growth has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which around &euro;1 billion went to China. Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly.  <\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, my Department and its agencies have a strong global footprint which is primarily aimed at facilitating growth in the trade of agrifood products with countries around the world. <\/p>  <p>  For example, my Department maintains a network of agriculture attach&eacute;s both within the EU, but also increasingly in countries with whom we are seeking to further develop our trading links, such as the United States of America, the Gulf Region and China. We also work closely with Bord Bia in developing international markets through its network of offices around the world, which it has recently expanded to include a presence in Singapore and in Warsaw. We work very effectively together, and with the relevant authorities, in progressing market access issues and organising trade missions aimed at promoting and supporting the export of Irish agrifood products.<\/p>  <p>  The role of trade missions cannot be underestimated in gaining further market penetration for Irish agri food products to new and existing markets. I led a series of very successful trade missions in 2017. Destinations included the Gulf States, US, Mexico, Japan and South Korea. In the case of the latter two, this was an ideal opportunity to exploit the benefits to be derived from the EU's recent trade and economic partnership agreements with South Korea and Japan. <\/p>  <p>  This work has continued in 2018. I have already led trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and my Department is currently making arrangements with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for a further trade mission in the last quarter of 2018 to Indonesia and Malaysia. Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high level political discussions.

The BDGP is the current main support for the suckler sector and will provide farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over six years.  <\/p>  <p>  It was introduced by my Department with the clear and stated objective of using bovine genetics to address the progressive decline in key maternal traits within Ireland's suckler herd.  The scheme aims to improve the profitability of the sector and  reduce the carbon footprint of the herd.  This is being achieved through the use of objective metrics which ensures consistency in evaluation of animals in terms of genetic merit. Currently there are 24,763 participants between BDGP I and II and a total of &euro;42.8 million has been paid to participants for 2017 already.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme's effectiveness is based on enhancing the genetic merits of the national suckler herd through clearly defined objective metrics for participants in the scheme. Key metrics such as the number of calves per cow per year, the calving interval, and age at first calving, docility, size and vitality, along with the prevalence of conditions such as scour and pneumonia are measured against agreed criteria.  One of the most notable examples is the number of calves per cow per year, which has moved from 0.80 in 2014 to 0.87 for 2017; which across the entirety of the scheme herds represents an additional 40,000 calves for sale, with a weanling output value of some &euro;30m to the participating beef farmers.<\/p>  <p>  After years of decline in key maternal traits, genetic trend for replacement index has now turned around and is generating significant additional gains for participating beef farmers. Additionally, important validation work undertaken by Teagasc and the Irish Cattle and Breeding Federation (ICBF) on 46 participating commercial beef farms over the past 3 years has confirmed that 5 star cows are more fertile, lighter (thereby requiring less feed), produce more milk (a heavier weanling) and overall produce a heavier carcass for beef farmers. In effect the key metrics of the scheme have provided clear evidence that cattle in the BDGP schemes are producing more benefits from less resources.  This is consistent with the key objectives of the scheme, which is to breed more profitable and climate efficient cattle.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I believe the scheme is an excellent example of utilising empirical evidence to enhance the quality and sustainability of the national herd.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200066#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Identification Schemes","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200066#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[31460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200066#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the cost of electronic sheep tagging will be reviewed in order that the sheep farmers do not have to carry the entire cost of tagging; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>The Minister announced the extension of EID to all sheep on 2 May 2018 whereby all sheep sold from 1<sup>st<\/sup>October 2018 must be identified electronically.

In this regard,  the UK commitment, in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December,  to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland,  was extremely important. <\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that the UK gives effect to this commitment is now a significant focus of the Irish Government, and we have the full support of our EU partners and of the European Commission Task Force in this regard. The so-called 'backstop' text that the EU has proposed in the draft Withdrawal Agreement provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and UK, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland  Our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, but it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides such certainty.<\/p>  <p>  Live exports are, of course, an important component of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry.

It will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK.

The grants and premiums offered by my Department&rsquo;s afforestation scheme are available to all landowners regardless of which county they are located. My Department has funded afforestation in every county in Ireland. <\/p><p>It is important that farmers in particular have the opportunity to improve their incomes by choosing forestry as a land use option on their farms. The sector as a whole already makes a positive contribution across the country supporting 12,000 jobs in various activities such as planting, harvesting, transportation and processing. Most of these jobs are located in rural areas where attracting direct investment can be more challenging. In 2017 it is estimated that private forest owners received in the region of &euro;25m in revenues from timber sales and almost &euro;67million in forest premium payments.  The cycle of economic activity continues into the next rotation as clear-felled forests are replanted. <\/p><p>According to the All Ireland Roundwood Forecast 2016 &ndash; 2035 output from Irish forests is expected to double over the coming decades to 8 million cubic metres. Most of this increased production will come from private forest owners. The key to creating additional forestry jobs in rural communities is the mobilisation of this timber in the years to come. This will allow the sector to grow existing markets and establish new markets; most importantly with the proper support in terms of research and development new products can be developed adding value to this indigenous raw material.  There are, however, several barriers to getting this timber to market and the Department has been particularly active in this area. These barriers include  the need to build more forest roads and a lack of forest management knowledge amongst many private forest owners.<\/p><p>To address these barriers, the midterm review increased the level of support for building forest roads and improved the grant scheme that encourages forest owners to thin their broadleaf forests. A new scheme establishing a network of knowledge transfer groups for forestry, is due to be launched shortly following a successful pilot. The aim of this initiative is to empower forest owners with the knowledge to actively manage their forests. <\/p><p>Development of new markets at home and abroad for new added value wood products will also lead to job creation across the sector. To this end my Department through COFORD launched its vision for moving the utilisation of timber up the value chain in its document entitled &ldquo;<i>Growing the Irish Forest Bioeconomy<\/i>&rdquo;. My Department&rsquo;s support for the bioeconomy is also demonstrated through its funding of research in this area. For example the Innovation in Irish Timber Usage project (IITU) investigated the potential for new add-value timber construction products such as Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) reinforced timber and Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT). <\/p><p>There is no doubt that there is significant potential to create further employment in the forestry sector across the country including in County Leitrim.

In the case of these two issues, Hungary is considered to have failed to address EU concerns about these laws or amend the legislation to bring it in line with EU standards. These cases are likely to be heard by the Court later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is important that Hungary and the European Commission engage on these issues and that, ultimately, a resolution may be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The Foreign Affairs Council oversees the EU's external actions and for this reason has not held formal discussions relating to the rule of law in Hungary. The General Affairs Council addresses horizontal and cross-cutting issues, including rule of law issues. For example, it is currently, at the request of the European Commission, examining the issue of the rule of law in Poland. <\/p>  <p>  Our concerns about issues relating to the rule of law in Hungary are well known and were raised by the Taoiseach when he met with Prime Minister Orban on 4 January last. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200068#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200068#WRF04300"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[31906\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200068#WRF04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the expenditure on external consultant reports by his Department since May 2016; the name and cost of each report, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for two Votes - Vote 27 (International Co-operation) and Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade).<\/p><p>The Department seeks to minimise expenditure on consultants and commissions external expertise only in areas where highly specialised skills are not available within the Department and, in particular, where independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.

The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017, containing 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions.<\/p>  <p>  In its second phase, the Working Group examined the cost of business insurance, in particular employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  This work culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, with 15 recommendations and 29 associated actions to be carried out.<\/p>  <p>In terms of progress with regard to the implementation of both Reports, the Working Group has published five quarterly update reports, most recently on 11th May last.  This quarterly update shows that of the 50 separate relevant deadlines within the Action Plan of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance up to the end of Q1 2018, one relates to an action no longer being proceeded with; of the remaining 49 deadlines, 40 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  In relation to the eight actions from the Report on Employer and Public Liability Insurance due for completion in Q1 2018, all eight were completed on time.   <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the next quarterly Progress Update will be completed by the end of July and will be ready for publication on the Department of Finance website shortly after.  This update will provide details on the implementation of all of the recommendations from both primary Reports.  However, a particular focus will be placed upon the 14 actions across the two Reports &ndash; seven from each &ndash; with Q2 2018 deadlines.<\/p>  <p>  While the overarching objective of these Reports and their recommendations is to deliver fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, one of the means of achieving this is to attempt to set the broader conditions for an insurance market which is competitive and attractive to new entrants in both the motor and business insurance markets. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I believe the enactment of the soon to be published Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill, following its approval by the Cabinet on 5th July 2018, will be a major help from a transparency perspective.  This should help in developing an understanding of how claims costs are impacting premiums, in particular understanding the relationship between the price paid by a customer for motor insurance and the cost to insurance undertakings.

A valid NCT is generally a minimum requirement in order for an insurer to provide cover.

Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the systems in use in the countries identified by the Deputy, I would refer him to the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s 2017 Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and in particular Chapter 7.5 and Appendix 7 of that Report which deal with international comparisons. <\/p>  <p>  The Report notes the use in some countries &ndash; including New Zealand and parts of Australia and Canada &ndash; of what is known as a &lsquo;no fault&rsquo; system, where the State pays compensation and\/or the cost of rehabilitation and the public pay for this system through taxes.  The Report states that some of these models are quite complex and should to be considered in a wider context.  As well as impacting on insurance premiums, they may impact on taxation and social security and must be considered in terms of existing constitutional, national and European requirements, e.g. the requirements of EU Motor Insurance Directives in terms of an individual&rsquo;s right to monetary compensation.   <\/p>  <p>  Given the time constraints, the Working Group recommended that a Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) be established with a view to proposing further measures that can help reduce the cost of claims.  Amongst other issues, the PIC was charged with analysing and reporting on alternative compensation and resolution models internationally, focusing on common law systems while taking account of social welfare, healthcare and related factors associated with each jurisdictions.  The PIC, under the chairmanship of former member of the judiciary Nicholas Kearns is expected to produce its final report shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above with regard to particular systems that operate in other jurisdictions, I would be cautious about the introduction of a State backed insurance scheme in this jurisdiction, as such an approach could actually decrease competition in the Irish insurance market, as some insurers may stop insuring particular risks if there is a view that the State is insuring these risks instead, particularly those lines of business that are considered to be unprofitable.  This could mean there would be a lack of choice for those seeking cover which could ultimately mean that the cost of insurance could become even more expensive than it is now.  Also, on this particular point, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing this risk than private insurance companies, and as a result there potentially would be a large financial exposure to the State if significant losses were incurred.  Any State insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost of that insurance would still have to reflect the risk involved.

The new systems will be scaled to accommodate maximum possible demand and contingency planning is being designed if customs procedures are required between Ireland and the UK in the short term. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has a presence at the ports, airports, mail and parcel depots, and is in ongoing discussion with the relevant stakeholders, including on the implications of a much higher proportion of traffic requiring customs clearance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200071#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Tax Reliefs","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200071#WRJ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[32159\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200071#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual cost of the section 481 film relief for the film production industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>Section 481 TCA 1997 provides a 32% payable credit for eligible expenditure on film production in Ireland.

and appointment in the civil service. In general it is policy for staff in the civil service to progress on incremental salary scales on the basis of a single point, subject to both satisfactory attendance and performance criteria being met.\u00a0 The award of an increment ordinarily falls for consideration on an annual basis. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 came into effect on 14 July 2003.  Since that date the provisions of the Act have been applied to the pay of fixed-term workers employed in the civil service.  Specifically, people appointed to civil service grades in a temporary capacity are placed on the same payscale as a &ldquo;comparable permanent employee&rdquo;.  Section 2 of the Act states that a &ldquo;permanent employee&rdquo; means an employee who is not a fixed-term employee.<\/p>  <p>  Such fixed-term workers have all the service under temporary contracts at the same grade aggregated for the purposes of incremental progression.  In the event that a fixed-term employee obtains a permanent appointment in the same grade, the fixed term service should be used in calculating the point of scale.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  An appointee to a post in the civil service (either permanent or fixed-term) who has had previous service in the civil service, or elsewhere in the public service, may be entitled to \u00a0incremental credit in respect of that service.

The level of resources for the PLC sector will be determined in the light of resources generally and the implications for other areas of education. The union side will engage positively in relation to commitments on future working arrangement and developments in the sector. Student numbers will be subject to audit on an on-going basis. The scope for rationalisation of provision will also be examined having due regard to ensuring appropriate provision on a geographic basis and the necessary critical mass for delivery of a quality education service.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Further and Education and Training sector has been reformed significantly since this time with the establishment of SOLAS and the restructuring of the 33 Vocational Education Centres (VECs) into 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs).<\/p>  <p>  The Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2014-2020, which was published in April 2014,\u00a0sets out the direction of FET\u00a0for this period\u00a0on both a national and regional basis. This Strategy has led to changes to provision in the FET sector with improved quality, a focus on employment focused programmes and basic skills. There\u00a0is also\u00a0a greater emphasis on employer engagement, planning and the promotion of the standing of FET. The strategy also aims to improve access and to support learners of all abilities across FET programmes. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Department published\u00a0the\u00a0ESRI report,\u00a0along with the\u00a0SOLAS response, on the\u00a0evaluation of the PLC programme. The ESRI report provides a solid evidence base to inform future policy development for the programme.\u00a0 It will\u00a0ensure that provision is planned to meet the needs of learners and employers, taking into account the changed context, particularly in the labour market, since\u00a0the PLC programme\u00a0was established in the mid 80s.<\/p>  <p>  The evaluation\u00a0confirms the positive role played by PLC courses\u00a0in providing education for a diverse range of learners, highlighting that on average PLC learners are 16% more likely to be employed and 27% more likely to have progressed to higher education, than those who left education with the Leaving Certificate alone.\u00a0 It also points to a greater need to develop systems to ensure that PLC courses focused on the labour market are aligned with employer requirements and are responsive to changing labour market needs.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the evaluation, SOLAS has established the PLC Programme Improvement Advisory Committee, comprised of PLC partners, to oversee development and implementation of a three year programme improvement plan. Based on the recommendations set out in the SOLAS response, implementation of the plan will ensure delivery of high quality education and training supporting learners to achieve their progression and employment goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200073#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Expenditure","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200073#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[32158\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200073#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost per annum of maintaining third level charges at their current rate for each year of the next five years; the cost of abolishing all such fees for each of the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under my Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible students with students paying the student contribution\u00a0currently\u00a0stands at &euro;3,000.

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. Though schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in primary and secondary schools, where staff employed on these schemes are paid directly by the Department and not via grant funding, these schemes have been largely phased out and have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant scheme. My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.<\/p><p>In terms of the latest negotiations that have taken place with regard to school secretaries; in 2015 my Department engaged with the Union side on negotiations in relation to the pay of school secretaries (and caretakers) who are employed using grant funding, and agreed to enter an arbitration process on that issue. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers)\u00a0comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.\u00a0 Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also\u00a0being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following\u00a0the arbitration process.\u00a0 These increases are in order to enable schools implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers).<\/p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078\/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079\/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.\u00a0 The circulars are available at:<\/p><p>Circular 0078\/201  <i>7:\u00a0\/\/www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/cl0078_2017.pdf<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200073#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200073#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[31664\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200073#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an application by a school (details supplied) for additional accommodation is still under consideration following partial approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>As\u00a0the Deputy is aware,\u00a0my Department recently approved grant to the school for a mainstream classroom and 2 special needs rooms.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is not in a position to provide\u00a0funding to the\u00a0school for a General Purpose Hall due to the necessity to prioritise funding for essential classroom accommodation to meet demographic need. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the National Development Plan (NDP), increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.\u00a0 This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in primary and post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Ireland Project 2040, we will invest &euro;8.4 billion (compared to &euro;4.9 billion in the previous decade) in primary and post primary school buildings.

This Department's role is to clarify for parents and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Under my Departments Action Plan on Bullying, new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools were published\u00a0at the beginning of the 2013\/14 school year.\u00a0 The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. <\/p>  <p>  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of these procedures. A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Where there is cause for complaint from a parent matters would normally be addressed to the individual teacher or school Principal as appropriate. If matters cannot be resolved at that level then a complaint can be addressed to the school BOM and \/ or Patron.

The Report of the Working Group was published in December 2017. It provides a wide-ranging assessment of the context within which the Campus is currently operating, and outlines a proposed vision for the future of the Mayo Campus, as well as a strategic and comprehensive plan to address the financial and sustainability issues which have been experienced by the GMIT Mayo Campus in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The plan includes 33 recommendations in total which will be implemented by the Governing Body and its Sub Committee. The sub-committee has been established to oversee and monitor the implementation of the working group report.\u00a0 The majority of the recommendations are for GMIT to implement including those with regard to course provision at Castlebar.  I understand that GMIT has taken the decision to withdraw two\u00a0courses\u00a0for 2018\/19 (BSc Hons in Digital Media and Society and the\u00a0Higher Certificate in Construction Management) due to an insufficient number of applicants to\u00a0make the programmes viable options for Castlebar. However, while GMIT took the decision to withdraw\u00a0these courses, the institute\u00a0has\u00a0reinstated other programmes at the Castlebar campus for 2018\/19\u00a0- Sustainable Building Technology and the Heritage related programmes of History &amp;amp; Geography and Culture &amp;amp; Environment - subject to a viable number of applicants. <\/p>  <p>  I have prioritised the\u00a0recommendations that relate specifically to my Department.\u00a0This includes the allocation of &euro;750,000 per annum for the next 5 years is to assist the sustainability of the campus for the duration of the implementation of the recommendations and measures of the working group report (in total &euro;3.75m).\u00a0 The provision of this additional funding will be contingent on GMIT making progress on implementing the recommendations in this review, and will be subject to review by the HEA.\u00a0 I have also committed to the provision of the necessary capital funding for the replacement of the roof of the GMIT campus that is currently in need of repair. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are continuing to work closely with GMIT to ensure that the other recommendations of the Report are being progressed. The working group report acknowledged the complexities and the necessary implementation time required for a number of the recommendations.\u00a0 It therefore recommended that the plan should be implemented on a planned phased basis by the sub-committee for 5 years, over the period 2018-2022, with a review at the end of year 2 and formal progress reports to be submitted to the GMIT Governing Body and the HEA every four months. <\/p>  <p>  My Department allocates recurrent funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to institutions under the HEA&rsquo;s remit, including GMIT. The HEA allocates this as a block grant to institutions to cover teaching, research and administration. This funding is allocated on a calendar year basis. For 2017 and 2018 the core block grant allocated to GMIT was as follows:<\/p>  <p>  2017  -  &euro;23.8m<\/p>  <p>  2018  -  &euro;25.1m<\/p>  <p>  In addition, GMIT like other institutions will receive funding in respect of free fees and other targeted initiatives e.g. skills, apprenticeships. These amounts have yet to be fully allocated by the HEA for 2018. The internal allocation of this grant, along with private funding received, is solely a\u00a0 matter for GMIT.  I would like to again assure the Deputy that my Department and the HEA will continue to work with GMIT on ensuring that the recommendations of the Working Group are implemented as soon as possible, and with appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders, to ensure the\u00a0future sustainability of the Castlebar campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200073#WRL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Data","counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM00600"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[31884\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a building (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>The school referred to by the Deputy has recently been authorised\u00a0to proceed to tender\u00a0for the\u00a0appointment of\u00a0a Building Contractor.\u00a0 Subject to no issues arising during the tender process it is envisaged that construction should commence\u00a0in quarter 1 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM00900"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[31885\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the proposed special school that will merge schools (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, a project to provide permanent accommodation for the schools in question is included on my Department's Capital Programme.\u00a0 The project will provide for two independent schools co-located in a campus arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department\u00a0are liaising with\u00a0officials in the relevant local authority in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding in relation to the acquisition of a suitable site to facilitate the building project.\u00a0 The proposed location for the schools, on the Cement Road in Drogheda, has been agreed\u00a0and the acquisition of this property is at conveyancing stage.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequent to the completion of the site acquisition process, subject to no issues arising,\u00a0the architectural planning process to deliver the new schools will then be initiated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Management","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM01200"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[31931\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200074#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to provide extra support for teaching principals in primary schools in view of the explosion of responsibilities, reports and paper work that have to be handled by teaching principals at present and the long hours involved in dealing with this work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>Recently published Circular 40\/2018\u00a0is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, which outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.

(July Provision).<\/p><p>The greater proportion of children with Autism attend mainstream classes, but students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there and will require the environment of a ASD special class.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.<\/p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, psychiatrist) stating that:<\/p><p>- S\/he has ASD<\/p><p>- S\/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.<\/p><p>Special class for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have a minimum of two SNAs for every class of 6 children.<\/p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special class provision is required, it is planned and established to meet that need.<\/p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 130% from 548 in 2011 to 1,304 across the country now, of which 1,048 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. \u00a0This network includes 130 ASD early intervention classes, 641 primary ASD classes and 277 post-primary ASD classes in mainstream schools. <\/p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There are currently 4 special schools and 70 special classes\u00a0in\u00a0mainstream schools in Co. Kildare, including 48 ASD special classes at primary level and 14 ASD special classes at post primary level. The NCSE has informed my Department that to date they have sanctioned 5 new ASD classes-4 Primary\u00a0and 1 Post Primary\u00a0- which are\u00a0due to open in September 2018. <\/p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs in county order, with new classes due to open in September 2018 highlighted, are available on the NCSE website at the following .<\/p><p>The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services for children with special educational needs in Kildare, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018\/19 school year and beyond. <\/p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities. <\/p><p>My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging. <\/p><p>As part of the process of planning for future provision, a number of measures have been included in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 to provide certain powers to the NCSE to designate a school placement for a child in circumstances where a child is experiencing difficulties in securing enrolment. <\/p><p>The Bill also proposes powers for the Minister, in certain circumstances, to require a school to open a special class for children with special educational needs. This amendment will give the Minister the power to compel a school to open a special class or classes where the National Council for Special Education has identified a need for such provision within an area.<\/p><p>These measures will further enhance the ability of my Department and the NCSE to plan for special class provision and to address issues in provision that may arise from time in time at local levels.<\/p><p>Guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes are available to download from www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200075#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200075#WRN02100"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[32221\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200075#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost of implementing a living wage of &euro;11.90 for all employees directly employed and or in agencies funded by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>All staff presently engaged at my Department,\u00a0including Services Officers\u00a0and\u00a0Cleaners,\u00a0are on an incremental pay scale and are\u00a0in receipt of salaries\u00a0which exceed the rate mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold data centrally in relation to payroll for\u00a0the bodies under its aegis.

DEIS Plan 2017 aims to build on what has already been achieved by schools who have benefitted from the additional supports available under the initial DEIS programme introduced in 2005.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While the allocation of additional teaching resources to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools, including the school in question, has served to improve learning outcomes, a gap still remained between DEIS and non-DEIS schools in terms of educational outcomes.\u00a0 Under DEIS Plan 2017, there is a commitment to carry out an evaluation of the level of teaching resources for schools participating in the School Support Programme.\u00a0\u00a0My Department established a Working Group to examine Class Size in late 2017. <\/p>  <p>  To date there have been two meetings of this Group and work is underway on examining the various issues that arise in terms of determining optimum class size in DEIS Primary schools.\u00a0The Group consists of representatives from the Educational Research Centre (ERC), the Education Partners and representatives from the relevant business units in my Department. \u00a0It is intended that a short report will be prepared by the Working group which will be referred to the\u00a0 Advisory Group for consideration. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Circulars govern staffing arrangements in all schools and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department&rsquo;s Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.<\/p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the previous generalised allocation model combined with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p>  <p>  No school, has lost supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. <\/p>  <p>  The new allocation model takes account of the schools educational profile and includes a baseline component for every mainstream school to support inclusion.  The profile also takes account of the number of students with complex special educational needs, the percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised tests, and account of the social context of a school, including gender and educational disadvantage.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE Working Group, which recommended the new allocation model, advised that a school's social context can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have in a school, as the socioeconomic status of students is linked to the incidence of certain types of special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  Some areas of special educational needs may be reflected in low test scores, while some students with relatively high levels of educational achievement may have emotional and behavioural difficulties.  The profiled allocation for schools therefore contains provision\u00a0to take account of social context, in addition to the other elements of the overall allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new special education teaching allocation model, the school referred to in this question, which also participated in the pilot of the new model, received an additional allocation of 47.5 hours, based on its school profile.  This increased the allocation for the school from 77.50 hours to 125 hours.  This additional allocation took account of the needs indicated by the profile of the school. It represents a very significant increase of almost 2 additional teachers to the school, to bring the total number of special education teachers in the schools to 5 additional teaching posts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200076#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":518,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200076#WRO01400"},{"type":"question","counter":519,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[32304\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200076#WRO01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the funding available for heating facilities in schools (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":520,"content":"<p>Funding for primary and post-primary\u00a0schools is dealt with on a per capita basis.

For example education services are delivered through the Department of Education and Skills and health services are delivered by the Health Service Executive.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, through the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), is responsible for the provision of accommodation and related services to protection applicants while they await a decision on their claim for international protection. There are currently 5,442 persons residing in 34\u00a0accommodation centres located nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  We have invested in improving the standard of services and facilities provided to residents in a number of key ways.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The McMahon report was published in June of 2015. This report forms the basis for ongoing improvements across the entirety of the system involving all Government Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  We are implementing a large number of these commitments within two broad themes. The first of these was by way of reforming legislation with the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016. <\/p>  <p>  A key feature of this new legislation was the introduction of a new single application procedure which will significantly accelerate the protection determination process and by extension will reduce the length of time which applicants spend in State provided accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The second major theme of improvements is in the area of the delivery of services.<\/p>  <p>  Following from the McMahon report and, in particular, since the publication of the Programme for a Partnership Government, a number of recommendations in relation to physical improvements to accommodation are being rolled out. The following are some examples:<\/p>  <p> - The introduction of full independent living at the Mosney Accommodation centre - each family is now able to acquire fresh food to their liking so they may prepare meals themselves. The new home cooking arrangements in Mosney went live on 23 January 2017. <\/p>  <p> - The full independent living model was subsequently rolled out in Ballyhaunis and Clonakilty in 2017 and in Athlone and Millstreet\u00a0to date in\u00a02018. The independent living model\u00a0is scheduled to\u00a0commence in\u00a0Bridgewater House in Carrick-On-Suir, Montague Hotel in Emo and the Birchwood Accommodation Centre in Waterford\u00a0City\u00a0by the end of\u00a0Q3 2018. <\/p>  <p> - Communal cooking facilities are being rolled out to other centres including the State owned centres (Killarney, Tralee, Knocklisheen in Limerick and Kinsale Road in Cork) and St Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan, Ocean View in Tramore and any other centres in which families are resident. <\/p>  <p> - A complete refurbishment consisting of triple glazed windows and doors and refurbished interiors and cooking facilities in each accommodation unit at the Athlone Accommodation Centre.<\/p>  <p> - Improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities.<\/p>  <p> - Teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendations of the McMahon report that involve structural changes or improvements\u00a0continue be implemented as quickly as possible, with due consideration of possible fire safety, building regulation and planning issues.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foregoing the Deputy will be aware that the Government recently transposed the \u00a0EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive 2013 into Irish Law. Under the Directive, asylum seekers will have access to the labour market nine months from the date when their protection application was lodged, if they have yet to receive a first instance recommendation from the International Protection Office and if they have cooperated with the process.\u00a0 This also gives effect to the recommendation in the McMahon report on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The Directive will bring the State into line with standards across the EU Member States for reception conditions for international protection applicants, including standards in accommodation centres. This continues the recent and ongoing positive work\u00a0(set out above) carried out to enhance living arrangements for applicants and their families, and to further provide a wide range of supports and services to asylum seekers. Participation in the Directive is another important step in the reform of our international protection and reception systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200077#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Expenditure","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200077#WRP02600"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[31702\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200077#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount paid to each direct provision operator in each of the years 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>All accommodation centres for those persons seeking protection, whether State-owned or privately owned, are operated by commercial companies.

In addition, there is one Chief Superintendent and two Superintendents attached to the DMR Roads Policing Units, a Superintendent and Traffic Inspector attached to each of the other five Regions. It is important to note, that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through specific enforcement operations.<\/p>  <p>   The Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau (GNRPB) to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country.

Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  That is why it is important to recognise that the role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the<\/p><p>Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part\u00a0in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates\u00a0a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  <\/p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees. <\/p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where\u00a0there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities.  <\/p><p>In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community\u00a0Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.\u00a0 As such it is not possible to give details of the number of Garda&iacute; attached to the National Community Policing Office in the manner requested. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cork City Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available,\u00a0was 678, of whom 28 members are Community Garda&iacute;. There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 71 civilians attached to the Division. \u00a0When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. \u00a0<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000\u00a0recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 53\u00a0members have been assigned to the Cork City<b><\/b>Division.\u00a0Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested\u00a0to date.\u00a0Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cork City Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. <\/p><p>For the Deputies information I have set out in the table below the number of Community Garda&iacute; by Station in the Cork City Division, as on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Commissioner.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Cork City Division Community Garda&iacute;   31 May 2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Station<\/td><td>Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ANGLESEA STREET<\/td><td>297<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BLACKROCK          \u00a0<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BRIDEWELL          \u00a0<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALLINCOLLIG<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BLARNEY<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARRIG NA BHFEAR<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GURRANABRAHER<\/td><td>63<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GLANMIRE<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYFIELD<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERCOURSE ROAD<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BISHOPSTOWN<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARRIGALINE<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CROSSHAVEN<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DOUGLAS<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PASSAGE WEST<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOGHER<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Garda Bureau of Community Engagement 31 May 2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Rank<\/td><td>CR<\/td><td>DC<\/td><td>AC<\/td><td>CS<\/td><td>SU<\/td><td>IN<\/td><td>SG<\/td><td>GD<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRT00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reserve","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRT00900"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[32333\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda Reserve members in the Cork city division by division, district and sub-district in each of the years 2009 to 2017 and to date in 2018, in tabular form.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":708,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly,\u00a0since 2014, 276 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointments Service (PAS)\u00a0have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. <\/p><p>With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track, it was possible for the Commissioner and the\u00a0Public Appointments Service\u00a0to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves\u00a0last March. That competition\u00a0attracted 2,394 applicants of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS. These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office. The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors, including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons. It is expected that the first of the successful candidates will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.<\/p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used optimally to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority to be completed in the first half of the year as set out in the Policing Plan 2018. <\/p><p>As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground and\u00a0engaging with local communities.<\/p><p>The material is not compiled in such a manner as to allow me to provide you with the number of\u00a0Reserve Garda&iacute; in each district over the period referred to; by way of assistance I have set out in the table\u00a0attached the number of Reserve Garda&iacute;\u00a0in the Cork City \u00a0Division from 2009 up to 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Commissioner.<\/p><p>Cork City Garda Reserve 2009-2018<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>46<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>65<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>42<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*As of 31 May 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Training","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRT01200"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":null,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"","asker":"1287","askee":null},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":712,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":713,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[32260\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of a visa application by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":714,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that a visa application from the person referred to was submitted to the Visa Office in New Delhi on 8 May 2018 and will now be processed in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification. <\/p>  <p>  The Policy Document\u00a0contains a stated business target that visa applications to join non-EEA national family members should be dealt with within twelve months of receipt of application.

Garda management keeps this distribution of\u00a0personnel under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Cork City Division was 678.  There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 71 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000\u00a0recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 53<b><\/b>members have been assigned to the Cork City<b><\/b>Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. \u00a0<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date.Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner\u00a0ran\u00a0a new recruitment drive\u00a0last month.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the\u00a0Cork City Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. <\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the number of Garda&iacute;\u00a0assigned to the Cork City Division in each of the years 2009 to 2017 and on the 31 May 2018, and the number of civilian staff assigned to the Cork City Division in each of the years 2010 to 2017 and on the 31 May 2018\u00a0the latest date for which figures are currently available as supplied by the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>Garda Civilian Staff by Division 2010-2018<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Station<\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012<\/div><\/th><th><div>2013<\/div><\/th><th><div>2014<\/div><\/th><th><div>2015<\/div><\/th><th><div>2016<\/div><\/th><th><div>2017<\/div><\/th><th><div>May-18<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td><div>63<\/div><\/td><td><div>63<\/div><\/td><td><div>63<\/div><\/td><td><div>61<\/div><\/td><td><div>61<\/div><\/td><td><div>58<\/div><\/td><td><div>58<\/div><\/td><td><div>70<\/div><\/td><td><div>71<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*The civilian figure is only recorded from 2010<\/p><p>Garda&iacute;\u00a0assigned to the Cork City Division in each of the years 2009 to 2017 and on the 31 May 2018 are contained in the link below.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Data","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRS01500"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[32319\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200080#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number and type of Garda vehicles attached to the Cork city division in each of the years 2009 to 2017 and to date in 2018, by division, district and sub district in tabular form.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>There has been very significant investment in Garda resources across the State in recent years.

In addition, there is one Chief Superintendent and two Superintendents attached to the DMR Roads Policing Units, a Superintendent and Traffic Inspector attached to each of the other five Regions.  It is important to note, that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through specific enforcement operations.<\/p><p>The Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau (GNRPB) to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country.  This is achieved through coordination of enforcement and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies.  I am pleased to say that I obtained sanction for an additional Assistant Commissioner to head up the GNRPB who is responsible for the oversight and strategic management of the policing of our roads network. In order to support this very important work and to facilitate the restructuring of the Garda Traffic Corps to Roads Policing Units in line with the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021, I have also recently secured sanction for a Chief Superintendent in the area of Roads Planning and Major Event Management and the creation of two specialist posts in the GNRPB at Superintendent rank one for Roads Policing and one for Major Event Management. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that following an internal examination of the role and function of the Divisional Garda Traffic Corps, they have been re-named Garda Road Policing Units, to reflect the role the Units will play in denying criminals the use of the roads network.  In addition to the Roads Policing Units focusing on the life-saver offences of speeding, seat belts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, they will also focus on crime prevention and crime detection.  Divisional Roads Policing units will work closely with other Divisional units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that following the completion of regional competitions for assignment to roads policing duties an additional 87 Garda&iacute; have been assigned to Roads Policing Units nationwide, in the first quarter of this year.  It is planned that a further 63 Garda&iacute;\u00a0will be assigned to the units later this year to bring the total additional Garda&iacute; assigned to Roads Policing in 2018 to 150 to support better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement and crime prevention. \u00a0<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 supports the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.<\/p><p>The provision of these additional resources to the\u00a0Commissioner is a key component in this Government's approach to improving public safety throughout the country which\u00a0will undoubtedly benefit policing in relation to transport services in Dublin and in other areas.  In this regard I have no plans to engage with the Commissioner to progress a dedicated public transport unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Investment is instead being made in enhancing the resources available for policing generally.  I believe this is the best use of scarce resources. <\/p><p>A further consideration is the ongoing deliberations of the Commission on the Future of Policing.

It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  That is why it is important to recognise that the role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the<\/p><p>Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part\u00a0in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates\u00a0a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  <\/p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees. <\/p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where\u00a0there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities.  <\/p><p>In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community\u00a0Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.\u00a0 As such it is not possible to give details of the number of Garda&iacute; attached to the National Community Policing Office in the manner requested. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cork City Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available,\u00a0was 678, of whom 28 members are Community Garda&iacute;. There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 71 civilians attached to the Division. \u00a0When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. \u00a0<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000\u00a0recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 53\u00a0members have been assigned to the Cork City<b><\/b>Division.\u00a0Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested\u00a0to date.\u00a0Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Reserve on the 31 May 2018 was 558,\u00a042 of whom are attached to the Cork City Division. It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly,\u00a0since 2014, 276 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointments Service (PAS)\u00a0have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. <\/p><p>With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track, it was possible for the Commissioner and the\u00a0Public Appointments Service\u00a0to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves\u00a0last March. That competition\u00a0attracted 2,394 applicants of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS. These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office. The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors, including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons. It is expected that the first of the successful candidates will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.<\/p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used optimally to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority to be completed in the first half of the year as set out in the Policing Plan 2018. <\/p><p>As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground and\u00a0engaging with local communities.<\/p><p>The material is not compiled in such a manner as to allow me to provide you with the number of\u00a0Reserve Garda&iacute;

target of 200,000 new jobs to be created by 2020, with 135,000 of these outside of Dublin.<\/p><p>Enterprise 2025 Renewed, launched on 9th March 2018, sets out a revised target to have at least 2.3 million people in employment by 2020.\u00a0 The objective is to ensure that, through effective policies, we realise employment growth that is sustainable over the longer term to 2025. The aim in Enterprise 2025 Renewed is to sustain unemployment at no more than 5.5% over the longer term.\u00a0 The aim also is to realise the potential of our regions so that unemployment is within 1 percentage point of the national average.<\/p><p>Employment continues to grow strongly with total employment in Q1 2018, of 2,237,900. The unemployment rate is now 5.1% (June 2018).<\/p><p>Enterprise 2025 Renewed does not set out targets on an annual basis. Nevertheless, the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 (launched together with Enterprise 2025 Renewed) that sets out specific actions to be taken across Government this year, targets the creation of 50,000 jobs in 2018. The APJ process involves a bi-annual monitoring process and produces a report that sets out progress on job creation and in relation each individual action by Departments.<\/p><p>Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the Action Plan for Jobs\u00a0are complemented by the Regional Action Plan for Jobs. A key ambition of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs is to see an increase of 10-15% in numbers employed in every region from the baseline year (2015) to 2020, and for each region&rsquo;s unemployment rate to be within 1 percentage point of the national average.<\/p><p>Numerical employment targets were published on this basis for each region at the launch of each RAPJ. These figures are listed in Table 1, along with progress in employment and current unemployment rates.<\/p><p>Separately, the regional NUTS boundaries were amended on the 21st November 2016 under Regulation (EC) No.2066\/2016 and took effect from the 1st January 2018.<\/p><p>As a result, new regional classification groupings have been introduced for Ireland. A summary of these changes at NUTS 3 level\u00a0is outlined in Table 2.<\/p><p>Furthermore, employment data is drawn from the CSO&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey, previously the Quarterly National Household Survey. The most recently published CSO Labour Force Survey contains\u00a0data for the new NUTS 3 configuration for the first time.<\/p><p>While employment targets were originally based on the old NUTS 3 regional groupings, current employment data is based on the new configuration that entered into effect in January 2018. As a result, data for some regions cannot be as reliably compared as others with their original targets.<\/p><p>My Department is currently working to review and revise employment targets in light of the changes to NUTS 3 configurations and CSO methodology.<\/p><p>The monitoring of actions under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs is coordinated by my Department in conjunction with the Regional Implementation Committees, Programme Managers and Secretariats. This information is collated through an online reporting tool, managed by my Department. Each Action in the RAPJ has a nominated &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the Action, depending on its area of focus. In the original eight Regional Action Plan for Jobs, there were 1,276 actions.<\/p><p>To date, my Department has published two Progress Reports per Region, with the third and fourth Progress Reports currently being finalised. The fourth Progress Reports will be final reports under the current iteration of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, closing out the narratives on Actions for the 2015 &ndash; 2017.<\/p><p>My current focus, and that of my Department, is on undertaking a refresh and refocus of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs through to 2020. I have recently asked each RAPJ Implementation Committee to lead\u00a0this refresh and refocus\u00a0process\u00a0to ensure their Plan's\u00a0relevance out to 2020. Each Committee is leading the refresh of their own Plans, looking particularly at building on each region&rsquo;s own competitive advantage &ndash; developing areas that are already strong, exploring new sectoral opportunities, while also examining regional vulnerabilities and potential barriers to investment or enterprise activity. My Department is working closely with each Committee in this process.<\/p><p>Table 1: Regional Employment Performance against 2020 Targets<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Region<\/b><\/th><th><div><b>2020 Employment Growth Target <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(pre-2018 NUTS3 regional groupings)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Increase in employment <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>Q1 2015 &ndash; Q2 2017<\/b><b><sup>1<\/sup><\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(pre-2018 NUTS3 regional groupings)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Increase in employment <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>Q1 2015 &ndash; Q1 2018<\/b><br \/><br \/><b> <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(new NUTS3 regional groupings)<\/b><b><sup>2<\/sup><\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Unemployment Rate Q1 2018 <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(new NUTS 3 regional groupings)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Border<\/td><td><div>28,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>7,600<br \/><br \/>(<i>excl Louth)<\/i><\/div><\/td><td><div>4.4%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midland<\/td><td><div>14,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>9,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>15,700<\/div><\/td><td><div>8%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>West<\/td><td><div>25,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>15,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>28,300<\/div><\/td><td><div>5.6%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td><div>66,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>48,200<\/div><\/td><td><div>83,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>5.3%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mid-East<\/td><td><div>25,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>19,300<\/div><\/td><td><div>22,800<br \/><br \/>(<i>incl Louth)<\/i><\/div><\/td><td><div>5.4%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mid-West<\/td><td><div>23,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>16,600<\/div><\/td><td><div>15,500<br \/><br \/>(<i>incl Sth Tipperary)<\/i><\/div><\/td><td><div>5.2%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South-East<\/td><td><div>25,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>16,200<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,400<br \/><br \/>(<i>excl Sth Tipperary)<\/i><\/div><\/td><td><div>7.2%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South-West<\/td><td><div>40,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>29,400<\/div><\/td><td><div>20,800<\/div><\/td><td><div>6.2%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State<\/td><td><div>246,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>166,800<\/div><\/td><td><div>206,100<\/div><\/td><td><div>5.7%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b><sup>1<\/sup><\/b><b><\/b>CSO regional data for the pre- 2018 regional groupings is unavailable after Q2 2017<\/p><p><sup>2 <\/sup>Note that the new Labour Force Survey reflects both methodological changes and changes to the<\/p><p>NUTS 3 regional groupings.

and addressing skills shortages. The National Competitiveness Council reports to the Government on the cost of doing business in Ireland annually, and one of the factors examined is the cost of childcare. In its Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2018 Report, published on 1st June, the Council notes that gross childcare fees in Ireland are relatively high compared to EU and OECD averages. As a percentage of average wages, gross fees for two children attending full-time care amount to 50 per cent in Ireland compared to the euro area average of 22 per cent.  Net Irish childcare costs for couples with two children, earning above the average wage are the third highest in the OECD. For lone parents Ireland is the most expensive OECD location. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the high cost of childcare represents an obstacle to labour force participation. As we draw closer to full employment it is vital that enterprise has access to a high quality flexible talent pool. Enhancing female participation has the potential to address the growing needs for skills and talent and to deliver significant social and gender equality benefits. To this effect, my Department is leading on one of the initiatives in Action Plan for Jobs 2018 which aims to identify relevant policy issues for cohorts with low participation rates based on patterns of labour market participation.  Policy responsibility for participation falls across multiple government Departments and my Department will be working with these departments to ensure the completion of this action by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, the Action Plan for Jobs also includes an action for the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme. The scheme will replace the existing childcare subsidy schemes with an income-based national scheme providing financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare. Such a new scheme will complement the universal free pre-school programme. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs have responsibility for the continued implementation of reforms to existing schemes and progressing the Affordable Childcare Scheme.

It has been  reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and  appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE  Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017,  following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement  approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient  care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies  to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an  application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a  clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP. Information for  patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website  at:\u00a0hse.ie\/yourmedicines.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to information on a specific appeal,\u00a0the patient's clinician should contact the MMP directly.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter  for the HSE and you will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I  cannot intervene in individual cases. However, I fully support the  objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Policy","counter":1147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1148,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[31889\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the improvements made in mental health engagement in the design and delivery of services through the further development of forums in each CHO in conjunction with service users, family members and carers and the development of standardised reimbursement methods as per the commitment in the 2018 HSE service plan.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1149,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"question","counter":1151,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[31890\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the development of a standardised approach to inclusion of mental health service users in care planning and the promotion of enhanced self-management for service users in line with the recommendations of the National Recovery Framework as per the commitment in the 2018 HSE service plan.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1152,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"question","counter":1154,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[31891\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the completion and launch of mental health engagement standards to ensure a consistent national model of engagement by service users and carers as per the commitment in the 2018 HSE service plan.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1155,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"question","counter":1157,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[31892\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the implementation of the CAMHS advocacy model.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1158,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Staff","counter":1159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1160,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[31893\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200089#WRBB04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the development of the mental health workforce to ensure the right staff with the right skills are allocated to the right services: if he will report on the development and implementation of workforce plans for all disciplines;

I have since referred the General Scheme of the Patient Safety Bill to the Oireachtas Committee on Health in order to allow the Committee to consider the undertaking of Pre-Legislative Scrutiny of the Bill.  I would hope to be in a position to introduce the Bill into the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, on 3 July, I signed the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 (Part 4) (Commencement Order) 2018 in order to prescribe Regulations in relation to open disclosure in line with the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  Subsequently, on\u00a04 July, I signed the Civil Liability (Open Disclosure) (Prescribed Statements) Regulations 2018, to come into effect on\u00a023 September 2018.  This timeframe will allow health services providers, in line with the Act of 2017, the space\u00a0to put in place any additional required resources, along with the appropriate governance structures, to\u00a0ensure compliance with the Regulations. \u00a0In order to achieve this,\u00a0clear lines of accountability and responsibility in relation to planning, developing, delivering, monitoring, evaluating and reporting on this important patient safety measure, in order to ensure that patients are placed at the centre of the process, is vital. <\/p>  <p>  These Regulations are an enhancement of the existing approach to open disclosure, which should be conducted in line with current policies and procedures, including the Health Service Executive's Open Disclosure Policy (2013).

Intensive Home Care Packages for people with more complex needs are being provided to approximately 235 people at any time, delivering approximately 360,000 hours in the full year. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE, working within its available resources, has sought to maintain and where possible to expand the range and volume of services available to support people to remain in their own homes, to prevent early admission to long-term residential care and to support people to return home following an acute hospital admission. <\/p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow.\u00a0 There is considerable demand for home support services over and above existing service levels.\u00a0 The Programme for Partnership Government includes commitments to increase funding for home support services and an additional funding of &euro;112 million has been provided for home support services over the past three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200092#WREE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":1306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200092#WREE04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1307,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[32035\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200092#WREE04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the Scally Inquiry has not yet been given access to the laboratory data in respect of the accuracy rates of smear testing; the steps he will to address this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1308,"content":"<p>I have made it clear from the outset that the HSE must do everything it can to support the inquiry underway by Dr Scally who has been appointed by Government.

Investing in additional capacity, including beds and theatre space; the progression of recruitment and retention of staff; the delivery of the NDP project including dedicated elective only hospitals and the ambitious reform agenda in the Sl&aacute;inteCare Report will improve waiting times and access for patients.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Health, I am committed to continuing the efforts to address the capacity of the hospital system and in particular its ability to respond during periods of peak demand.  In this context, I have asked my Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system, which can be opened and staffed this year and into 2019 in order to improve preparedness for Winter 2018\/2019. <\/p>  <p>  A submission received from the HSE in this regard is currently under consideration by my Department.  I can confirm that this proposal includes both new beds which incur capital costs and new beds within existing space which have little or no capital cost requirement.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a number of waiting list initiatives currently underway to improve access this year.  In particular, the Inpatient and Day Case Action Plan which was launched in April 2018 and the allocation of &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) in Budget 2018 to secure treatment for patients and reduce waiting times. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF have provided funding for a number of outsourcing initiatives across the Saolta University Health Care Group and including Letterkenny University Hospital (LUH). As a result, these almost 500 patients have received treatment through both outsourcing and HSE insourcing initiatives. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also advise that LUH have also run additional lists in order to address waiting times in urology, general surgery and endoscopy.  Furthermore LUH have commenced a cross-border initiative in conjunction with CAWT for patients on vascular waiting lists.

These targets are not scheduled to change until the next programme which will cover the period up to 2027.\u00a0There is a commitment in the National Development Programme for a publicly funded afforestation programme after the current programme expires in 2020. It is far too early therefore to set out any details of what form the next afforestation programme will take and as always this will be informed by detailed stakeholder consultation. <\/p>  <p>  However, the midterm review of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 completed in February this year did provide my Department with an opportunity to take stock of the existing planting strategy. In doing so opportunities for increasing forest cover and further incentivising the planting of native woodlands where examined. One approach is to encourage farmers to incorporate forestry into their farming mix so that agricultural production can continue alongside timber production. Where grazing land is underutilised for example, animals could be moved off the more difficult fields onto more productive land. In this way agricultural production can be maintained, while at the same time establishing a valuable asset that delivers both economic and environmental benefits. Trees could be grown on active farms not just for timber, but for ecosystem services also. Strategic planting of new forests can intercept nutrient and soil runoff thereby protecting water quality while affording shelter to grazing calves. Native tree species can provide a rich habitat for wildlife, whilst simultaneously producing trees for firewood either for domestic use or for sale in local markets.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to traditional forestry offered by the existing afforestation scheme other planting categories that may be more attractive to farmers are available. Agro forestry is supported under the current forestry programme which allows grazing of animals to take place on land that is also planted with trees. The cutting of silage between rows of trees is also possible in this forest type. The forestry for fibre category provides for the planting of eucalyptus and popular which can be harvested after 15 years, a much shorter rotation than traditional forestry where clearfell could take place between 35 and 40 years from the date of planting. Timber from this type of planting can be used for domestic heating on the farm itself or supplied to local markets to meet a growing demand for firewood. \u00a0My Department is interested in developing these forestry types further in the next forestry programme.<\/p>  <p>  Although the MTR is a recent publication and its revised measures are relatively new, it is already showing benefits in terms of increased planting rates for broadleaf species. There are challenges in reaching our afforestation targets but my Department is determined to do everything possible to help these targets be achieved in light of the obvious climate and environmental benefits. To this end, I have established an Implementation Group to oversee the implementation of the MTR comprising the forestry sector, landowner representatives, and environmental NGOs. This Group has already had its first meeting and will be central to driving the implementation of the afforestation programme to 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200097#WRKK02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Knowledge Transfer Programme","counter":1515,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200097#WRKK02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1516,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[31060\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200097#WRKK02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to problems with issued knowledge transfer payments, particularly for partnership farms; the steps he will take to rectify the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1517,"content":"<p>Knowledge Transfer (KT)\u00a0is one of a suite of measures included under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 and involves the formation of knowledge transfer groups across the beef, dairy, equine, sheep, tillage and poultry sectors.

Consumer demand for premium imported beef is forecast to rise significantly, driven by increasing urbanisation,\u00a0higher\u00a0disposable incomes and health awareness. \u00a0The import of frozen boneless beef, the category for which Ireland will have market access, has grown\u00a0nine-fold within the last\u00a0five\u00a0years.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On the dairy front, Ireland exported over &euro;4.5billion in dairy products to\u00a0nearly 130 countries in 2017. Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada and Japan, which will\u00a0benefit\u00a0the sector, my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new\u00a0third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products. In many instances such efforts are on foot of Ministerial led trade missions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America stood at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017. \u00a0The value of trade to these markets has increased by 159% since 2009, and now accounts for over 20% of total agri-food exports.\u00a0 This growth has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which around &euro;1 billion went to China.\u00a0Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective,\u00a0my Department and its agencies have a strong global footprint which is primarily aimed at\u00a0facilitating growth in the trade of agri-food products with countries around the world. <\/p>  <p>  For example, my Department maintains a network of agriculture attach&eacute;s which is increasingly\u00a0focused on countries with whom we are seeking to further develop our trading links, such as the United States, the Gulf Region and China. We also work closely with Bord Bia in developing international markets through its network of offices around the world, which it has recently expanded to include a presence in Singapore and in Warsaw. We work very effectively together, and with the relevant authorities,\u00a0in progressing market access issues and organising trade missions\u00a0aimed at promoting and supporting the export of Irish agri-food products.<\/p>  <p>  The role of trade missions cannot be underestimated.\u00a0I led a series of very successful trade missions in 2017. Destinations included the Gulf States, US, Mexico, Japan and South Korea. In the case of the latter two, this was an ideal opportunity to exploit the\u00a0benefits to be derived from the EU's recent trade and economic partnership agreements with South Korea and Japan.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This work has continued in 2018. I have already led\u00a0trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and\u00a0my Department is currently making arrangements\u00a0with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for a further\u00a0trade mission in the last quarter of 2018 to Indonesia and Malaysia. Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions. \u00a0Both of these markets had been identified by my Department as offering huge potential to the Irish agri-food sector.<\/p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access\u00a0in these destinations. \u00a0It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market profiling exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200098#WRLL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1559,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200098#WRLL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1560,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[31839\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200098#WRLL02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which fish conservation policies have benefited fish stocks in the seas around this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1561,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s goals for sustainable fisheries are supported through the Common Fisheries Policy. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. Key features of this policy include setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in all cases by 2020; a discards ban (Landing Obligation) to be phased in by the beginning of 2019; and the establishment of a regional decision making arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an essential aspect of the policy. Fishing opportunities for each Member State are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY. \u00a0To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p>  <p>  This December&rsquo;s Council showed a rebuilding of many stocks, this was demonstrated by a 34% increase in our whitefish quotas off the North-West coast and a 64% increase in the Irish Sea. These are both areas that were severely depleted just five years ago. The work done to rebuild these stocks has led to significant increases for quotas for our fleets. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservations measures are paying off.<\/p>  <p>  The landing obligation (also referred to as the &lsquo;discards ban&rsquo;) was also introduced as part of the current CFP. Its objective is to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding. The reform is being rolled out in a practical and phased manner. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1st of January 2015.\u00a0 The landing obligation was extended to certain demersal stocks (whitefish and prawns) from the 1st of January 2016 and will be fully phased in by the 1st January 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2017, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. From the 74 stocks, 29 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2017. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being overfished declining from 22 in 2014 to 17 in 2017.The biomass of stocks, the quantity of mature fish in the sea, has also increased. In 2017 there were 27 stocks in a positive state above biomass trigger points. This is an increase over the preceding year of 22.<\/p>  <p>  There\u00a0remains\u00a0work left to do to but the progress so far must be acknowledged. The EU Commission has also noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continue to improve which indicates that we are seeing the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices. I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress that will ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200098#WRLL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":1562,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200098#WRLL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1563,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[31840\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200098#WRLL02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of new markets identified for Irish food exporters in the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1564,"content":"<p>The\u00a0past\u00a0three years\u00a0has seen great strides taken in the opening of\u00a0new markets and the deepening of trade for existing markets\u00a0for Irish Agri food exporters.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 we gained access to the US market for Irish beef.\u00a0 During the same year we also got access to the Canadian market for Irish beef and to the Omani market for Irish beef and sheepmeat. <\/p>  <p>  In 2016 we gained access to the Maldives for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat.

The range of speakers came from the political sphere, from the European Commission, and from my Department.\u00a0 The conference was a very useful opportunity to hear the views of the many stakeholders involved. <\/p>  <p>  Over the coming months there will be detailed negotiations at all levels across the EU as we work together to shape the final outcome.  At the centre of all our considerations will be the need to ensure that CAP Post 2020,\u00a0properly funded,\u00a0will continue to support\u00a0farm families\u00a0and the rural economy. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The current draft proposals must first be agreed at EU Council level.\u00a0 Whenever the agreed final EU Council position on the CAP proposals is reached, the proposals will then be discussed at trilogues\u00a0involving\u00a0the EU Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These processes must all be worked through and\u00a0concluded before a\u00a0final text can be agreed.  I will be working with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that the final\u00a0CAP regulations can\u00a0 support\u00a0farm families in the many challenges they face.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the\u00a0draft Hen Harrier Threat Response Plan is nearing completion by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and is currently being refined in consultation with Departmental stakeholders.  The draft\u00a0was circulated to the Consultative Committee and\u00a0observations from members of the Committee were sought. Committee members requested a period in which to make observations, and the final observations were\u00a0received last week.  DCHG will review those observations and meet with the Committee as soon as practical and the plan will then go to public consultation. <\/p>  <p>  For my part, I will continue to consult with stakeholders as the\u00a0negotiation\u00a0process for the new CAP proceeds, having regard to the need to deliver on national strategic priorities and to make the most effective use of the funds available.  However, we are not yet at the scheme design stage for the post 2020 CAP. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200099#WRMM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":1621,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200099#WRMM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1622,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[31982\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200099#WRMM03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the funding provided towards capital projects in counties Meath and Louth in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018, by project name, location and cost in tabular form.","asker":"1329","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1623,"content":"<p>My Department has provided funding towards capital projects in counties Meath and Louth\u00a0for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 as outlined in the attached table. <\/p><p><b>2016<\/b><table><tr><th>County Louth<\/th><th>Project Name<\/th><th>Location<\/th><th>Amount of funding provided &euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Organic Capital Investment Scheme<\/td><td><\/td><td>3,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Dairy Equipment<\/td><td>Various locations in the county<\/td><td>35,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Farm Safety<\/td><td>Various locations in the county<\/td><td>23,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Sheep Handling<\/td><td>Various locations in the county<\/td><td>18,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Buoy Replacement<\/td><td>Clogherhead Harbour<\/td><td>5,510<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Repairs to Pier Wall<\/td><td>Carlingford Pier<\/td><td>15,492<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Additional power point at Inner Harbour<\/td><td>Clogherhead Harbour<\/td><td>5,939<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector<\/td><td>Various locations in the county<\/td><td>135,081<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mart Modernisation Scheme<\/td><td>Adree<\/td><td>1,644<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Forestry - Afforestation<\/td><td><\/td><td>399,708<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Forestry -Reconstitution<\/td><td><\/td><td>1,378<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Forestry &ndash;

Therefore my Department&rsquo;s more recent investments in soil carbon have mandated international collaboration as a condition of funding. <\/p><p>This week I have announced details of a &euro;600,000 grant of a new Agro-Soc project arising from DAFM&rsquo;s 2017 Research Call.  The project, which is being co-funded by the EPA, plans on examining carbon sequestration mitigation options that do not adversely impact on agricultural production.  Improved soil carbon should lead to better nutrient cycling and soil nutrient availability.  Management practices that can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to mitigate climate change will provide the basis for inclusion of grassland soils into both carbon trading schemes and life-cycle assessments (LCA), which will assist the sector both in terms of carbon credits and a reduced carbon footprint on agricultural produce.  This project seeks to quantify carbon sequestration within managed grasslands, to identify the upper limits of soil carbon storage and identifying the regulators within a pastoral system that control soil carbon capture.  As such it will directly address the 4 per mile initiative to enhance carbon stocks and improve soil quality in agricultural soils.<\/p><p>My Department required that this work will be undertaken in cooperation and coordination with the EU Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change&rsquo;s (FACCE JPI) &lsquo;Thematic Annual Programming on organic matter sequestration in the soil&rsquo; (TAP-Soil) initiative to maximise international synergies.  Similarly, in 2017, DAFM provided almost &euro;500,000 in funding to enable Irish researchers collaborate with international partners in two relevant soil carbon sequestration themed projects funded under the ERA-GAS on greenhouse gas (GHG) Mitigation and Monitoring.<\/p><p>Research continues to be carried out and my Department will monitor the outcomes of relevant research in this area as it arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200099#WRMM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":1633,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200099#WRMM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1634,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[32152\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200099#WRMM04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the latest data regarding UK imports of dairy product.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1635,"content":"<p>The United Kingdom including Northern Ireland represents Ireland&rsquo;s biggest dairy export market, accounting for approx &euro;990 million of exports in the dairy sector in 2017.

The rigidity of the remediation scheme proposed under the 2002 Act\u00a0 presents problems for the delivery of a modern, efficient and effective scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme envisaged under the 2002 Act provides for financial assistance for remediation only.  It does not provide for radon testing.\u00a0  The Environmental Protection Agency has advised that the experience in other jurisdictions shows\u00a0that where the initial radon test is not subsidised a considerable barrier to the uptake of a remediation scheme arises.\u00a0 It is essential that any radon scheme should, in the first instance, maximise the number of households conducting a test for radon\u00a0in their homes.\u00a0\u00a0Greater numbers of households carrying out radon tests will enable us\u00a0to accurately identify and map locations of particular concern, target householders in\u00a0high-radon areas, and\u00a0promote increased awareness of the problems of radon gas in dwellings.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The radon landscape has changed considerably since the 2002 Act was enacted, particularly\u00a0as regards the number of commercial operators offering radon testing and remediation services.\u00a0\u00a0Under the National Radon Control Strategy, a training and registration scheme has been established by the EPA for radon remediation and measurement services.\u00a0 Any scheme of grant aid for radon testing or remediation should ensure that the work carried out under this scheme is by one of these registered services qualified to remediate radon.  The current legislation does not make it an explicit requirement that remediation works be carried out by a registered provider.<\/p>  <p>  For the reasons above, it is clear\u00a0that any radon remediation scheme should\u00a0be grounded in\u00a0new primary legislation and will\u00a0 need to be\u00a0properly structured to ensure the maximum\u00a0uptake for testing and remediation of dwellings.  To assist in this, I have provided funding for the EPA to undertake\u00a0a survey on radon financial incentives in both high and low risk areas.

The plan provides an outline provision of &euro;2.4 billion for the\u00a0entire programme, &euro;2 billion for Bus Connects in Dublin and &euro;0.4 billion for Bus Connects programmes in our regional cities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided for over &euro;750 million over the next 4 years to progress the initial stages of BusConnects.  The costs of the various elements of the overall BusConnects\u00a0programme will be\u00a0confirmed as part of the appropriate appraisal and procurement processes required under the Public Spending Code. <\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0has responsibility for the planning and implementation\u00a0of public transport projects and programmes in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), including the BusConnects programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NTA recently published a discussion document focussed on the 16 core bus routes, pathways and cycle tracks\/lanes that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of Dublin city.  A second document &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo; was published by NTA\u00a0last week. <\/p>  <p>  This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex and is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes.  Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit the full potential of these investments. Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking. <\/p>  <p>  The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals; and grow suburban feeder networks.  While there will be concern about any change, these strategies will deliver considerable benefits for the customer: much simpler city services; much simpler fare structure;\u00a0and more frequent all day services through new and frequent strong orbital services interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines.  <\/p>  <p>  Full public consultation on the network redesign proposals, involving Dublin Bus, and using local brochures, local face-to-face events, digital imaging of the network, on-line surveys and consultation with user groups will commence from the 16th July and will continue for 8 weeks. NTA will launch a full public consultation process\u00a0on the proposed core bus corridors later this year.  <\/p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this matter, I have referred the Deputy's questions to the Authority for a more detailed reply on the specific issues raised.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200103#WRQQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance","counter":1805,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200103#WRQQ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1806,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[31754\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200103#WRQQ03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress made regarding the establishment of a motor insurance database; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1807,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to his identical question of 29 May 2018 PQRef 23713\/18.\u00a0 Recommendation 28 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance concerns the establishment of a motor insurance database, known as\u00a0the Motor Third Party Liability (MTPL) insurance database, to identify uninsured driving.

The National Transport Authority (NTA), Dublin City Council (DCC) and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with public transport operators, are progressing various measures to ensure efficient functioning of transport within the city centre.  This includes a range of measures set out in the 2015 Dublin City Centre Transport Study to facilitate additional capacity for public transport, cycling and walking in the city.  As anticipated by the study and in advance of the introduction of Luas Cross City, NTA introduced additional bus lanes along the North and South Quays.  In addition, there has been a host of other junction and traffic signal changes implemented in advance of the Luas Cross City becoming operational.  Furthermore, the NTA, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council, have reduced bus vehicle volumes passing through the College Green area including changes to access for taxis too. This has further alleviated congestion in this area during morning peak. These parties continue to keep the situation under review.  <\/p>  <p>  These measures complement recent investment in public transport infrastructure in the Dublin region which has expanded public transport passenger journey capacity to provide an alternative to private car use.  As the Deputy is aware, this includes the city centre rail resignalling project, the re-opening of the Phoenix Park Tunnel with direct Kildare Route services to the Docklands; Luas Cross City; ongoing bus fleet replacement; the expansion of public bicycle share schemes, accessibility enhancements, introduction of Real time passenger information (RTPI) and online and app-based RTPI services for bus services and integrated ticketing system (Leap) as a platform for further enhancements to fare and ticketing systems; and sustainable transport projects such as junction upgrades, traffic management measures and bus, cycle and pedestrian infrastructure.  <\/p>  <p>   The National Development Plan 2018-2027 includes a number of key public transport priorities for Dublin including BusConnects, MetroLink and priority elements of the DART Expansion Programme.  These projects will provide further viable alternatives to car transport for commuters into the city centre to reduce congestion.  To supplement these larger projects, a range of other measures are being taken in the short and medium term to deliver additional transport capacity which will have a positive impact on traffic in Dublin city centre.  These include: <\/p>  <p>  - A 10 minute all day service on the core DART network will be provided later this year; <\/p>  <p>  - Passengers who use the recently opened Kildare route Phoenix Park tunnel services to Grand Canal Dock will see these services extended to off-peak periods, as well as peak periods later this year;<\/p>  <p>  - The introduction of 28 refurbished rail carriages to re-enter service in 2019;<\/p>  <p>  - An order is expected to be placed in 2019 for diesel-electric rail fleet to provide an extended DART service across the Dublin rail network; <\/p>  <p>  - TII are currently in the design and procurement phase for a new mandatory variable speed limit and lane control system on the M50, with the intention of commencing operations in late 2019\/early 2020.<\/p>  <p>  - A new service timetable has been introduced across the Luas network to make optimum use of the new 55m longer trams in service on the Green Line and the introduction of additional capacity between Heuston and the City Centre on the Red Line. <\/p>  <p>  - Over the medium term, further Green Line capacity will be added by lengthening the 26 existing trams to 55m over the period 2019 to 2021.

A copy of the relevant sections of\u00a0my previous answer is outlined\u00a0below for your convenience.<\/p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Details of the regional and local road grant allocations and payments to local authorities are outlined in the regional and local road grant\u00a0booklets which are available in the D&aacute;il Library.<\/p>  <p>  The tables included in the payment and allocation booklets outline expenditure\u00a0by type of grant programme.  For the Deputy's information\u00a0an explanation of the purpose of the\u00a0main road Regional and Local Road Grant Programmes is set out below:<\/p>  <p>Restoration Maintenance (RM): The purpose of the RM grant is to protect the structural integrity of the road by way of surface dressing through the sealing of the road surface.  The purpose of restoration maintenance is to maintain the asset before it requires improvement.<\/p>  <p>  Restoration Improvement Grant (RI): The RI grant programme is the main road strengthening programme and caters for surface restoration, pavement overlay works, complete road rehabilitation works and for drainage works where required.<\/p>  <p>  Discretionary Grant (DG): Councils have discretion in spending these grants for improvement and maintenance works subject to selecting from a list of eligible works. However Councils are requested to prioritise projects which involve strengthening works, remedying road defects, winter maintenance and drainage works.<\/p>  <p>  Bridge Rehabilitation (BR): This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake bridge rehabilitation works.<\/p>  <p>  Safety Improvement Works (BS): This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake safety improvement works.<\/p>  <p>  This year\u00a0ring-fenced funding is being made available for Community Involvement Scheme (CIS)\u00a0and a Drainage Programme.  The CIS facilitates community involvement in repair and improvement of roads while the purpose of the Drainage Grant   is to promote network resilience.<\/p>  <p>  Specific Grant and Strategic Grants: The Department no longer seeks annual applications from local authorities in respect of the Specific (road improvement schemes costing up to &euro;5 million) and Strategic\u00a0(improvement schemes costing over\u00a0&euro;5 million) grant programmes.  Instead it considers projects on a case by case basis taking into account the availability of funding and the outcome of project appraisals.<\/p>  <p>  As regards national roads, within its annual budget, allocations to individual local authorities is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's Questions to TII for direct reply.

To facilitate this expansion, three registration intake windows were introduced (allowing children to be registered, as they became eligible, in September, January and April).  The average uptake increased from 38 weeks to 61 weeks.<\/p><p>From September 2018, all children meeting the minimum age requirement of 2 years and 8 months will be eligible for a full two programme years on the ECCE scheme.

This is not its intended\u00a0focus. Therefore, in the first instance, it may be helpful to outline the specific role of the Collaborative Forum and how this differs significantly to the Commission of Investigation established by Government to comprehensively examine the experiences of women and children in mother and baby homes.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters was established by Government (S.I. No. 57 of 2015) to provide a full account of what happened to women and children in these homes during the period 1922 to 1998. The three person Commission comprises Judge Yvonne Murphy (Chair), Dr William Duncan, and Professor Mary E Daly. \u00a0The Commission has all the necessary legal powers to make any findings and recommendations it deems appropriate in relation to the broad range of public concerns which have been referred to it.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Most importantly, the Commission is independent in the conduct of its investigations and the Chair of the Collaborative Forum, or its members, have no influence or role in relation to the investigation.  The Commission is due to submit its findings by February 2019.<\/p>  <p>\u00a0 As the Commission continues with its important work I am committed to working directly with former residents in developing solutions to the issues of concern to them and their families.  The Collaborative Forum is a progressive response to the theme of &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; which has emerged from facilitated consultations with former residents. Through the forum participants will create and drive forward a process that they can support and trust. I believe the Charter for a Collaborative Forum, which I agreed with my Government colleagues, presents a genuine opportunity for constructive dialogue and collective action. I am confident that the Forum will enable former residents to identify, discuss and prioritise the issues of concern to them. Its work can have a lasting and positive impact.<\/p>  <p>  The approach I have taken to the appointment of a Chairperson and members of the Collaborative Forum recognises that it is an advisory rather than an investigative body.  I consider the approach taken, including an independent process for the selection of 19 representatives of former residents, to be the appropriate one.<\/p>  <p>  While Mr Kearney is not himself a former resident he brings a wealth of relevant experience from a distinguished career in public service. He has a proven track record of supporting successful collaborative projects, including his work with the Moore Street consultative group. I believe he will play a key role in the establishment of an effective and inclusive Forum, working with and in the interests of former residents.

On 23 January last, this Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated on a TCA basis, including provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.<\/p>  <p>  The TCA ensures that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions, as opposed to the timing of them, determines what their final pension outcome will be. In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace raising families or in a full-time caring role.  Crucially, unlike the proposed homemaking credits proposed in 2010, the home caring credit now proposed will apply to periods both before and after 1994.  This recognises that most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, if they had taken a home caring break, would most likely have done so before 1994.<\/p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes and who are currently assessed under the yearly average model to qualify for a higher rate of the contributory State pension.  A person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new home caring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions.

The GPPR is also clear that the photographs should not systematically be considered to be special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person.

The delivery of targeted affordable housing, for purchase and rent, was a priority topic at the recent\u00a0Summit\u00a0with local authority Chief Executives.  It\u00a0also featured prominently at\u00a0a post-Housing Summit meeting with local authority Housing Directors of Service this week. <\/p>  <p>  A three-pronged, targeted approach to affordable housing is being pursued.  Firstly, in terms of affordable housing for purchase, I have now\u00a0commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.\u00a0 This Scheme will be delivered by local authorities developing their sites in key locations.  The Scheme will be complementary to other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new local authority home loan scheme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, I am also\u00a0determined\u00a0that cost rental\u00a0homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future.  There is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of\u00a0our main urban\u00a0centres\u00a0as places to live and work. Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe. <\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and a number of\u00a0Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working with my Department to get our first cost rental pilot,\u00a0at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly.  In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development.  The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded very shortly.\u00a0 Once we have proven the concept through our pilot projects, I plan to roll out cost rental across other suitable sites.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I\u00a0am providing additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.\u00a0 Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am re-directing the &euro;50 million planned funding for Phase 2 of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced &euro;25 million to &euro;75 million.\u00a0 When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.\u00a0 The call for proposals under the Serviced Site Fund issued last month.<\/p>  <p>  Based on initial estimates, the local authorities in Dublin, the\u00a0Greater Dublin Area,\u00a0Cork and Galway,\u00a0have\u00a0lands with the potential\u00a0to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.\u00a0 My Department is continuing to work with\u00a0the key\u00a0local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites for\u00a0at least 10,000 new affordable homes, and that analysis\u00a0is progressing well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200109#WRXX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Agency Data","counter":2073,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200109#WRXX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2074,"qnumday":737,"qnumall":"[31947\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200109#WRXX01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of the &euro;70 million rolling Housing Agency fund by county; the number of units delivered in the past 12 months; the average cost for each unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2075,"content":"<p>Under Actions 1.1, 2.5 and 5.6 of Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Housing Agency is actively engaged with banks and investment companies in relation to its acquisitions programme.\u00a0 An Acquisitions Fund of &euro;70m, which is a revolving fund, has been established with the objective of acquiring some 1,600 units over the period to 2020 for social housing use.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Since the Fund was established, the Agency has had bids accepted on 645 properties.

The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters.  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.<\/p>  <p>  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years.  The national average ARV decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and has increased slightly each year from 2016 to 2018. <\/p>  <p>  As provided for under section 66 of the Local Government Act 2001, local authorities may decide to offer assistance or money in kind in order to promote the interests of the local community, which includes, inter alia, the economic or general development of the administrative area (or part of it) of the local authority concerned.  Also, local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulty in the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options that reflect capacity to pay.<\/p>  <p>  The principle of local authorities levying rates based on an independent valuation is well established, and I have no plans to change this.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates, and last year the Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill.  Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support the implementation of policy objectives, including: local economic and community plans; objectives contained in Development Plans and Local Area Plans; and national planning policies.  The Bill is with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting, with a view to it being published later this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200109#WRXX03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Eligibility","counter":2095,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200109#WRXX04000"},{"type":"question","counter":2096,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[32147\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200109#WRXX04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the review of income eligibility limits for social housing will be finalised and published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":2097,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[32148\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071200109#WRXX04200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to improve the income eligibility limits for social housing in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2098,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 745 and 746 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each\u00a0local authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.
