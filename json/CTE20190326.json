I shall make a few general remarks about the issue because that is the context on which the amendments were submitted.  Notwithstanding the efforts of owners who look after their greyhounds, including when they no longer race and do not win prize money, there are too many examples of appalling cruelty to greyhounds.  The Animal Welfare Act does not address this matter for various reasons.  As a result, the Bill is an opportunity for us to get the issue of greyhound welfare right.<\/p><p>It is ironic that there is ban on the use of wild animals for entertainment purposes and circuses, which is great, but that greyhounds - domesticated animals - are used for so-called entertainment in places like Macau, Pakistan and China.  Unfortunately, the greyhound industry in Ireland did not highlight or try to do something about this issue.  The animal welfare groups have drawn attention to it but greyhounds continue to end up in Macau, China and Pakistan.  That is the reality and we have the proof because the same few names of Irish greyhound breeders keep recurring on a Chinese database.  In addition, copies of studbooks have been uploaded and greyhounds that were previously registered to race in Ireland are currently advertised as breeding material in China.  I have evidence that details on 41 Irish greyhounds have been uploaded to a Chinese website.  Sadly, greyhounds face extreme cruelty in the countries to which I refer.  I have met a couple of the lucky greyhounds that were rescued and brought back to Ireland.<\/p><p>I have tabled various parliamentary questions on the export of greyhounds.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine outlined in his reply to one of my parliamentary questions that Bord na gCon is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry.  Bord na gCon does not support the export of greyhounds to destinations that do not conform to the standards stipulated in the Animal Health and Welfare Act, the Welfare of Greyhounds Act, etc.  The Minister agrees with the stance taken Bord na gCon yet the reality is what is happening.  My amendments, and the amendments tabled by my colleagues, seek to put a stop to the export of greyhounds.<\/p><p>The vast majority of Irish greyhounds are exported to the UK so there are issues concerning Brexit.  We know that dogs in the EU are governed by EU law and we know that EU countries are being used as transit points.  That is the reality.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 focuses on welfare and seeks the inclusion of the International Greyhound Forum, in conjunction with R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, the new name for Bord na gCon, to have a role in determining what constitutes sound and problematic exports.  Let us remember that it is the welfare groups that pick up the pieces when racing dogs no longer have a commercial value.  With decreasing attendances at greyhound race meetings, we know that there are financial issues too.  Perhaps financial necessity might lead some owners to do what we know has happened and is continuing to happen.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 seeks to make it an offence to export greyhounds to countries outside of the EU, a matter I explained earlier.  Subsection (2) in the amendment takes out the transit question because we know that countries are being used as transit countries.  While the practice will be hard to police, it is important that we acknowledge that the practice is a problem and send the message that Ireland does not accept the practice of exporting dogs bred here to places countries such as Macau, Pakistan and China.  In addition, we want to send the message that dogs can be traced back to their Irish breeders because organisations have traced dozens of dogs in Pakistan, China and Macau back to Ireland.<\/p><p>The next amendment is on offences, fines and prison terms.  It seeks to create an environment whereby the trainer will know the consequences for exporting to countries where there is no animal welfare and no concern for greyhounds.  I hope the amendment will act as a deterrent for those trainers who knowingly export their greyhounds to these places.  We know that people export their greyhounds for profit.  Therefore, the fines and sentences must be good enough to act as a real deterrent.<\/p><p>The next amendment gives the Minister the power to amend the white list on an annual basis.  The initiative allows for change because some countries may introduce animal welfare regulations.  The amendment gives people a chance to come off the white list.  Equally, countries that are supposedly in favour of animal welfare may go off the list if they are shown to be in breach of animal welfare regulations.  The amendment also means we would have figures for the number of dogs that are exported, where they are sent, etc.  Such data is crucial because at the moment we depend on independent sources for the information.  The amendment puts an onus on the Minister and the Department.<\/p><p>These amendments are not draconian in any way.  Again, I stress the fact that they are about the welfare of dogs.  If we really want to seriously improve animal welfare then we must do all we can to ensure that Irish greyhounds do not end up in countries where there are appalling breaches in animal welfare.  In fact, there is no animal welfare in quite a number of countries.  If people genuinely care for greyhounds, they will not have a problem with these amendments.  Owners tell me all the time how much they love their greyhounds.  Acceptance of these amendments is an opportunity for people to show how much they truly love greyhounds and to put that into action.<\/p><p>I have not tabled an amendment on the registration of greyhounds but I will do so later.  Why must one register greyhounds with the Irish Coursing Club?  There are greyhound owners who do not want to register their dogs with the club as they do not participate in coursing yet their registration fees go to the club.  I am sure that the greyhound racing industry could do with more funding because attendance at race meetings has decreased.  I have introduced the amendments and I will leave it at that for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#B01100","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>This Bill is very important from a number of perspectives, including those relating to probity, integrity, funding, governance and the welfare of greyhounds.  The central objective of the Bill is to root out neglect and cruelty in the industry by way of an emphasis on welfare.  When I spoke on Second Stage on behalf of the Labour Party, I stated that we need to implement a detailed list of appropriate countries to which the licensed export of greyhounds from the State would be permissible.  There has always been concern about the number of dogs that are exported and the destinations to which they are exported.  There is a need to have appropriate and proper welfare regimes in place.  During the pre-legislative scrutiny phase - I am not sure whether the Minister of State or his predecessor was responsible for this issue at the time - we heard many presentations from organisations such as Dogs Trust Ireland outlining significant concerns about the records of some of the destinations to which greyhounds are being exported.<\/p> <p>  I support the broad thrust of these amendments.  If they are passed this evening and subsequently implemented, that will be fine and dandy from our perspective.  As the Minister of State will probably tell us, however, the big issue would be how we control what happens when greyhounds go elsewhere.  I am sure there will be significant legal complexity attached to that.  While I support this proposal, I can see why the Minister of State may well have difficulties with it.  I hope he does not.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State and his officials have worked hard on the Bill over a number of years.<\/p> <p>  I have expressed the view on behalf of the Labour Party that the welfare issue has not been adequately addressed in the Bill.  That is a significant shortcoming by any standard.  Given that a substantial amount of taxpayers' money is being invested in the industry, we have to make sure all aspects of it are above reproach from the perspectives of integrity, probity, governance, sanctions and animal welfare.  The export of unwanted greyhounds to places like Macau is a matter of concern.  We have seen programmes which have illustrated that.  Breeding establishments in China and elsewhere seem to have little or no animal welfare provision.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan stated, we can start with a detailed register of the precise locations to which greyhounds are being exported.  We should be exporting to EU countries which we hope are reputable.  We are aware of the overarching regimes in those countries.  Such regimes, which are rightly onerous, involve microchips, vaccination programmes and the requisite levels of supervision.  There is a passport regime and everything.  We must try to address what happens after greyhounds go to such locations, however.<\/p> <p>  We have to salute the work of the rescue agencies that valiantly look after abandoned greyhounds with little or no help or resources from the State.  In fairness to the Minister of State, he showed his intention to address that when amendments were tabled in the Seanad.  We welcome that.<\/p> <p>  I note that an amendment dealing with the collection of data was made in the Seanad.  Maybe I have misread the Bill.  I understand that on foot of the acceptance of an amendment, a provision in the Bill permits the gathering of export data.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Broughan, introduced the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017, the aim of which is to control the export of greyhounds and to provide for the publication of a white list of countries to which the export of greyhounds under licence would be permissible.  That Bill, like Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's amendments, seeks to make it an offence to export greyhounds to countries that are not on the white list.<\/p> <p>  I have met personnel from Dogs Trust Ireland.  I must say they are excellent ambassadors for their organisation and are very well informed.  I understand they are also members of the International Greyhound Forum.<\/p> <p>  The amendments before the committee are well-intentioned, focused and constructed.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State would like to implement them if he could see a way of doing so.  While I am supporting the amendments, I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on how we could ensure these provisions would be implemented at the destinations to which it would be permissible to export greyhounds.  If a dog can be exported from this country to one of those places, it can also be exported from another EU member state to such a place.  That is an issue.  The bloody problem is how to resolve that.  We may well have to tackle it at EU level.  Perhaps the Government will lead the way in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#C00100","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I wish to declare that I am a director of a private greyhound track.  As a result, I have a vested interest in this industry.  I welcome the Bill, for which we have been waiting for a long time.  The integrity of the industry has to be paramount.  That means making sure it stands up to the highest scrutiny.  This Bill goes a long way towards addressing many of the difficulties we have been experiencing.  Many people have an image of a sport that involves dogs running with prohibited substances in their bloodstreams that either enhance or diminish performance.  Some years ago, the board dealt with a high-profile case on Irish Greyhound Derby final night that fell into the latter category.  If this Bill is enacted, it is absolutely essential that anyone who is found to be using a prohibited substance to enhance a greyhound's performance or to slow a greyhound down faces the full rigours of the law.  It should be possible for such a person to be suspended and dealt with adequately, but that has not been the case up to now.  This has damaged the industry and must be put right.  From my perspective, it is one of the reasons this Bill needs to be brought through the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency.  When it is passed, it is absolutely essential that it does what it says on the tin.  When a greyhound fails a test after a race or at any time in its racing life - it could be in the kennels or wherever - the full rigours of the regulations must be brought to bear.  I welcome the provisions in this legislation that deal with such those issues.<\/p> <p>  This Bill addresses dog welfare.  It must be recognised that increasing amounts of money are being put into dog welfare by the board and by dog owners.  A great deal of work is being done to rehome greyhounds after their racing lives have come to an end.  This is becoming an priority for the industry.  Deputy Penrose spoke about Dogs Trust Ireland.  It is now a recognised fact that greyhounds make good pets.  They are being exported to various countries around the world.  Significant numbers of dogs are finding new homes.<\/p> <p>  I do not think the amendments that are before the committee can be enforced practically.  We are making presumptions about the conditions in which dogs are kept in certain countries.  It recently emerged that dogs were being held in very poor conditions on a puppy farm in this country.  If people were to present such an isolated incident as an example of the way dogs are cared for in Ireland, it would be a very misrepresentative picture.  The vast majority of dogs in this country, including greyhounds, are kept in very good conditions.  I do not think we can make assumptions about other countries.  The vast majority of our dogs are exported to the UK.  When they have been exported, they are outside the jurisdiction of this State.  I do not think it is practical to try to put restrictions on what the UK does.  I do not think it can be done, at any rate, even before we have the problems of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  While I accept that these amendments are well-intentioned, this Bill goes a long way towards addressing welfare in the whole dogs industry and that has to be respected.  This Bill focuses on the welfare of dogs.  I think there is a recognition in the industry that in the past, the importance of welfare was probably not as high on the agenda as it should have been.  That fact is well recognised now.  If the industry is to try to drive on into the future, it must show that the welfare of greyhounds is one of its utmost priorities and it must ensure dogs are well cared for after they have finished racing or breeding.  That is my view on these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#C00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan wants to come back in before I call the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#C00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I would like to make a couple of points.  I am not making any assumptions or presumptions about China, Macau and Pakistan.<\/p><p>We have the graphic evidence, statistics and details of what happens in those places from animal welfare groups.  This is an opportunity to prevent Irish greyhounds from ending up in such places, where we know they will not be treated properly.  Surely a difficulty with implementing something is not a reason for it not to be done.  Although we can only try to do our best with implementing the Bill's provisions, they must be in the Bill in the first instance if they are to have any sort of chance.  This is an opportunity for us to signal that we are serious about greyhound welfare.<\/p><p> We know what happens in the countries in question.  I could provide the names of the Irish greyhounds that have ended up there, but I will not at this point.  I might save that until the Bill has been taken further.  We have the documentary evidence.  I am not making assumptions or presumptions.  I know what is happening.  If we care about greyhounds and their welfare, we will do our best to ensure that they do not end up in such places.  I am not stating that everything would be great and the provision would work wonders, but it would signal our seriousness about the welfare of our greyhounds, especially when they were not making money in Ireland.<\/p><p> It is thanks to welfare groups that it is now realised that greyhounds make good pets.  It was not thanks to the greyhound industry, which only came in later.  Australia has banned the export of greyhounds to China and there are airlines that will not take greyhounds to certain countries, yet Ireland is now stating that, because it will be difficult to implement this provision, we will not do anything to prevent their export.  I do not accept that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#C00400","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank members for making the time to debate this legislation on Committee Stage.  It has spent some time reaching this point.  We navigated it through both the Seanad and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I hope to have it passed into law as soon as possible.  Everyone accepts that it is well overdue.<\/p> <p>  I will address this group of amendments relating to the creation of a white list of countries approved for the export of greyhounds and a report on greyhound exports together.  While I appreciate that the motives of the members proposing the amendments are concerned with the welfare of greyhounds, I am not convinced that the amendments would have the desired effect even if it was legally possible to ban greyhound exports to certain countries.  At the outset, I wish to be clear that I am not here to defend any other country's record on animal welfare.<\/p> <p>  The amendments would be unworkable and impossible to enforce.  The reality is that the majority of greyhounds are exported to the UK.  It is not for the Department to police whether greyhounds sent to the UK or any other country are subsequently sent on to a different country.  If the Department tried to police whether greyhounds sent abroad were subsequently sent on to another country, all we would do is add bureaucracy on responsible greyhound exporters and owners while failing to stop an unscrupulous exporter who had exported to a country with a problematic welfare record.<\/p> <p>  Setting aside the unworkability of the amendments, there should be no doubt that any legislation banning the exports of greyhounds to certain countries would face significant legal difficulties.  The Department examined this issue and sought and obtained legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Broughan, which proposed measures similar to those being discussed now.  The advice from the Attorney General was that said Private Members' Bill was incompatible with domestic and European law.<\/p> <p>  Most importantly, and despite our differences on the amendments proposed, the Deputies and I share the same aim of protecting the welfare of animals.  The Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 obliges Bord na gCon to publish a code of practice for the welfare of greyhounds.  The primary objective of the code is to set standards and clearly define what is expected of all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds.  In this context, the board proposes to expand the existing code to include provisions on best practice when exporting greyhounds.<\/p> <p>  Bord na gCon has always made it clear that it only encourages and promotes the export of greyhounds to countries that have established positive animal welfare codes and practices.  Bord na gCon is a participant in the International Greyhound Forum, the organisation being proposed in amendment No. 1 as a decision maker over the white list.  At a recent meeting, the board advised participants that it would engage with and accept input from members of the forum in formulating the expanded code.  The board has informed me that it is fully committed to amending the code and that work on the expanded code will be finalised when consideration of this Bill has been completed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of reporting on exports of greyhounds, it is not currently possible to retrieve the information being requested by the Deputies.  The trade control and expert system, TRACES, that is used to record the export of canines does not differentiate between greyhounds and other dogs.  Breed is not a category used in TRACES for categorising any animal within the same species, so it is not possible to report on greyhounds exported to other countries.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#D00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#D00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>No.  That statement was contradictory.

Even today, representations were made to me that private trainers are finding it increasingly difficult to get regular racing for their dogs.  That is just one instance where they believe they do not have enough of a voice at the board.  <\/p><p> The board membership is being increased from six to eight under the provisions of this Bill.  That presents an opportunity to have a broad spectrum of representation by the various stakeholders in the industry who would be able to voice their opinions at the board table.  Such a provision is working well in Horse Racing Ireland, where a cross-section of stakeholders, ranging from stable lads to trainers to breeders to various sectors of the horse racing industry, are well represented.  An opportunity is presented for us to do the same for the greyhound industry.  That is the reason I have put forward this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#D01300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Where are greyhound welfare groups represented on the board?

I will also try to answer the specific point raised by the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Coveney, commissioned Indecon consultants to carry out a review of Bord na gCon.  At that time, the board had debts of &euro;23 million, largely due to investment in Limerick stadium.  That debt has hindered development of the industry ever since. <\/p> <p>  One of the aspects the report examined was the constitution of the board of Bord na gCon.  The Indecon report was critical of the skill set of the board.  It identified a number of skills gaps in the made-up of the board, principal among those was the need for a depth of financial expertise with a requirement for more than one board member with financial qualifications and senior professional experience.  While there was an implicit criticism that the lack of skills was a contributory factor in the decision to develop Limerick stadium without proper capital appraisal and cost-benefit analysis, there was also explicit criticism of the Limerick development and its governance.<\/p> <p>  Indecon stated: \"Based on the analysis and documentation available to Indecon, it is hard to conclude anything other than the fact that there was inadequate appraisal of the Limerick capital investment.\"  The report also identified the requirement for a senior legal professional, a marketing expert and a veterinary expert on the board.  The latter requirement, that there would be a person with veterinary expertise on the board, addresses the welfare aspect.  While not entirely in favour of singling out one specific skill to be set down in primary legislation, in view of the animal welfare and integrity role of the board, I made a Report Stage amendment in the Seanad setting down a requirement for veterinary expertise on the board. <\/p> <p>  To return to Deputy Cahill's amendment, based on past experience where the board was dominated by industry representatives, I believe it would be wholly inappropriate for 50% or more of ordinary members to be made up of industry representatives.  This amendment totally disregards the recommendations of the Indecon report and I believe that it would be a totally retrograde step.  The industry must change its approach to avoid any danger that the mistakes of the past would be repeated. <\/p> <p>  I also point out that this is a board that is responsible for regulating the industry and it will be responsible for drafting regulations to give effect to provisions set out in this Bill.  It would, therefore, be totally inappropriate for 50% of the board to be made up of representatives of those to whom those regulations will apply.  I accept, however, that there should be some industry representation on the board.  That is why I made an amendment to allocate one or more places on the board to persons with detailed industry knowledge.  This, I believe, will allow for some flexibility, while maintaining the balance in favour of a skilled board.  I have today announced the appointment of two new members to the board, Mr. Gary Brown, with marketing expertise, and Mr. Wayne McCarthy, with a financial background and a long association with the greyhound sector.  Both were selected through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process.  In addition, an existing member with significant financial and risk management expertise has been reappointed for a second term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#E00400","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The Indecon report, which is advisory, contains recommendations with respect to the industry.  It has not been followed as a bible by the board up to now, therefore, in terms of the composition of the board, it does not have a prescribing authority over this committee.  The board composition that members consider to be right should be decided here.<\/p> <p>  To say that the mistakes made in the past were due to either dog owners or representatives of the tracks who were on the board is a very misleading statement.  Mistakes were made regarding Limerick track but going back over that will not solve much because that is fairly historic.  To say that was because the board was composed of people who had an interest in the greyhound industry is a misleading statement.  <\/p> <p>  I refer again to Horse Racing Ireland, where stakeholders ranging from stable lads to trainers to breeders are represented on its board.  Assertions are not being made that because those stakeholders are represented on that board it is carrying out its duties in a manner that is not for the benefit of the industry.  If we neglect to have stakeholders on this board, we will have a board that will quickly lose touch with the realities on the ground.  I have no objection to a veterinary expert or a marketing expert being on the board, as that would represent a very good balance.<\/p> <p>  This Bill recommends that eight people would be on the board.  It is a relatively small board but without representatives of greyhound owners, trainers and of the private tracks being assured seats at the table, those stakeholders could easily find their voices would not be heard.  If one talks to people at the tracks, they will say that they believe their voices are not been heard.  This Bill will frame the industry for the next 20 to 25 years and, hopefully, it will drive forward the industry.  We would be acting wrongly if we do not allow stakeholders to have a voice on the board.  Stakeholders will resent it if we put forward a broad that is not representative of the industry.  The people who are working in the industry and making a living out of it are the people who most want to get it moving forward and progressing.  I disagree with the Minister of State in that respect and I will be pressing this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#E00500","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State want to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019032600002#E00600","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will make a few points about the Indecon report.

Three of the recommendations are being addressed in this Bill, including the strengthening of the board of directors and management, which is provided by way of the additional appointments proposed in the Bill.  Also, the Minister is to appoint members of a statutory independent greyhound racing control committee and control appeal committee, and regulations and procedures are to be introduced to ensure effective enforcement of penalties.  All of the other 24 recommendations in the Indecon report have been implemented.<\/p><p> I was a member of this committee when the Horse Racing Ireland Bill was put through.  Horse Racing Ireland differs from R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann or Bord na gCon insofar as it only has a promotional role.  The Turf Club is the horse racing regulatory board and carries out the regulatory role for the thoroughbred industry with enforcement through its rules.  The distinction of integrity and enforcement applies between HRI and the Turf Club.  In this case the roles are all under the guise of one board.<\/p><p> The amendment recommends eight members plus the chairperson.  The Deputy has proposed an additional four plus a veterinary member.  We have already provided for at least one member or more with industry knowledge.<\/p><p> Another recommendation related to the establishment of a consultative forum and this has been done.  The forum can draw from all stakeholders.  It meets regularly throughout the year and includes representatives of the State, including Department officials.  The board members and the executive are all present.  Track owners and horse trainers and owners are all invited.  It is an open forum for discussion of issues directly relating to the board.

The Irish Traveller Movement was founded in 1990 and is a nationally-based Traveller-led organisation representing our members.  One of its core values and principles is to challenge the racism Travellers face in Ireland today.<\/p> <p>  Setting out the historical context is important and I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the experience of Travellers within the State education system.  Not commonly known to the wider community is the importance of awareness of the historical experiences of the Traveller population in terms of the fundamental rights and wrongs of the past and instilling confidence going into the future.<\/p> <p>  From the 1970s up to the present day, there were segregated schools in Ireland.  Children were educated in Traveller-only schools and classes from the 1970s up to 2000.  From this point, Traveller segregation began to be phased out.  Many Travellers today recall horrific stories of being washed when they came into school and having separate play and lunch times to their settled peers.  The expectations of these children by their teachers were extremely poor.  Many were left to draw pictures and play and many today are unable to read or write.<\/p><p>Those experiences still influence how Traveller parents engage with the education system, as well as how they respond to their children&rsquo;s experiences of racist bullying within school.  In January 2017 the report commissioned by the Department of Justice and Equality from the Economic and Social Research Institute, A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, indicated that Travellers experienced extreme disadvantage in employment, housing and healthcare and faced exceptionally strong levels of prejudice.  The gap between Traveller participation and retention in education has worsened compared to their settled counterparts.  I will refer to this aspect again.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, in 2011 Traveller-specific educational supports were cut by 87%.  The cuts included the withdrawal of the visiting teacher service, resource teachers for Travellers in primary schools, allocation of teaching hours in second level schools and enhanced capitation payments at primary and second level.  The cuts were made at the time of the highest retention rates of Traveller pupils from primary to post-primary institutions in the State.  They decimated the support infrastructure for Traveller education and had a detrimental impact on Travellers' educational progression.  <\/p><p> I also bring the committee's attention to reduced timetables, which is a real concern, of which some members may be aware.  The Irish Traveller Movement has raised this matter, as have other organisations.  In many instances, it is Traveller parents who are monitoring and reporting to Traveller organisations which, in turn, have brought these concerns to various Ministers.  We are concerned that in certain areas no school or only one actively supports the inclusion of Travellers.  Such a school then informally becomes the school in the area to which Travellers are directed and becomes seen as \"the Traveller school\".  Non-Traveller children and their peers are denied the opportunity to learn about Travellers within the education curriculum.  There is an opportunity to correct this through Senator Colette Kelleher's Private Members' Bill dealing with the inclusion of Traveller history and culture within the mainstream curriculum.  We understand it has both Government and cross-party support.  It also has full community support.<\/p><p> The Irish Traveller Movement is very concerned about the practice of having reduced timetables across the country.  We know about these concerns because parents are reporting them to us.  There is no monitoring of the practice by Tusla or the Department of Education and Skills; instead the responsibility is placed on parents to make a complaint via section 29 of the Education Act 1998.  This issue must be addressed.<\/p><p> The majority of schools have systematically failed to recognise Traveller culture and Travellers' way of life is invisible across the school setting.  As a result, non-Traveller children are denied the opportunity to learn about Traveller culture in a positive learning environment, thus increasing the chances of their views being formed by the negative stereotypical views of Travellers that persist in wider society.  We look forward to exploring other matters we have raised in our submission on Traveller children's progression within the education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to address it.  I am the co-ordinator of the Yellow Flag programme, the eight step innovative whole-school initiative which supports schools in promoting inclusion, challenging racism and celebrating diversity.  The programme guides schools in communicating the values of equality and inclusion and accessing staff training on equality and diversity.  We ask them to survey students and parents on their current experiences of schools and develop action plans to put in place curricular and extra-curricular activities that promote interculturalism.  Schools must also develop a whole-school diversity code and review and develop their policies to ensure an inclusive and respectful environment and robust mechanisms are in place to address and tackle racism.<\/p><p>Schools must present documented evidence of their work which is assessed by an external panel on completion to determine achievement of the Yellow Flag.  The Yellow Flag is an initiative of the Irish Traveller Movement, given the long-term evidence derived from its members, as Mr. Bernard Joyce alluded to, of the negative experience of Travellers within the education system and the need for school-based solutions.<\/p><p> Issues such as conscious and unconscious bias, exclusion on the basis of identity or historical prejudice, absence of Travellers in teaching and school management, institutional racism and poor awareness or knowledge of Traveller culture have a highly detrimental effect on young people's education and learning, and also on their sense of identity and self-belief.  What informs the programme and its practical approach is the recognition of the attitudes, policies and practices within schools and how they influence daily life and the essential role they play in building positive educational environments, in addition to the adoption of national intercultural and anti-racism policy and regulations.<\/p><p> Traveller students continue to face discrimination in schools.  We see that manifesting in many hiding their identity and changing their accent for fear of being bullied or treated less favourably by teaching staff and their fellow students.  We recommend that an anti-bullying education programme, not just guidelines, be introduced in every school.  Reports of discrimination in education settings are still evident to us, ranging from name-calling to physical assault, social exclusion and institutional practices which reduce Traveller student timetables or segregate them from other students.  These are frequently reported to the Irish Traveller Movement.  Even with all of the resources that the Yellow Flag can offer, it can be hard to challenge discrimination among teachers and school managers, which can be either conscious or sometimes unconscious or based on hidden biases.  Mandatory anti-racist and intercultural training or continuous professional development for teaching staff has been proposed in a number of statutory policies but is not available in practice.<\/p><p> The Irish Traveller Movement is very conscious of the need to expand the Yellow Flag and to strengthen the impact it can have on the education system.  It is important to note that there is no other programme like the Yellow Flag currently operating in the country.  We have worked with 88 schools across 13 counties, reaching more than 30,000 students and more than 2,500 teachers.  However, to date, there has been no investment by the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, both of which have aims across a range of objectives and policies which are commensurate with our own.

Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre has given central importance to pursuing full and equal participation for Travellers throughout the education system since our inception in 1985.  This continues to be based on our understanding of education's key importance for human dignity and rights.  It was previously part of our name, which was Dublin Travellers Education and Development Group.  Our work more recently expanded to include Roma and this has significantly enhanced our work.  I hope we can come back at some stage in the future to talk about the specific experiences of Roma within the education system.<\/p> <p>  These are challenging times globally for all concerned with rights and equality, as we remember the terrible tragedy in Christchurch, New Zealand, this month and ongoing racism and exclusion in Ireland.  A direct provision centre in Rooskey was burned and a house in Clonmel allocated to a Traveller family was vandalised.  These incidents demonstrate the need for a new national action plan against racism.  However, it is also a time of opportunity for Travellers with the recent recognition of Traveller ethnicity by the Taoiseach and D&aacute;il in 2017.  There is also the formal adoption of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, 2017-2021, NTRIS, which sets an agenda, including in the crucial area of education.  Its aims have yet to be realised and urgent attention is needed to ensure its full implementation.<\/p> <p>  The disadvantage and poor educational outcomes for Travellers have been well-documented.  We know that 13% of Travellers complete secondary education compared with 92% in the majority population.  Some seven out of ten Traveller children live in families where the mother has either no formal education or primary education only.  The national action plan on access to higher education has set a target of having 80 Travellers in third level education by the end of 2019.<\/p><p>To date, the figure has risen from 35 to 61, which is 26 additional Travellers.  This points to the fact that we need to intensify our efforts in this regard but it also demonstrates that targeted interventions and resources are effective.  We also know this from the Royal College of Surgeons, which has an affirmative action programme where a number of Travellers have the opportunity to study medicine and become doctors.<\/p><p> With regard to recommendations, we need to create a more inclusive learning context that promotes respect for diversity and interculturalism and addresses racism at individual, structural and institutional levels.  We would like to make a number of recommendations in this area.  All educational personnel, including policymakers, need to receive training on interculturalism and anti-racism, with an explicit focus on Travellers.  For far too long, there has been a culture of low expectations among teachers and principals with regard to Travellers.  This means that many Travellers have missed out on achieving their full potential and goals in life.  In this context, we welcome the amendment to the Education Act before the D&aacute;il, which proposes that Traveller culture and history be reflected in the school curriculum.  While the 2017 integration strategy of the Department of Education and Skills provides basic principles for inclusion, we also need respect for cultural identity and social and economic inclusion.  The proposed amendment will require concrete programmes and materials for schools on Traveller history and culture.  We believe this is a fundamental step in the right direction.  It is only a first step, as we need to include other cultures and identities in the school curriculum.<\/p><p> Now that we are post recession, we would like to see the restoration of support services for Travellers attending schools.  These services were savagely cut by 85%, as Mr. Joyce outlined.  Direct and targeted resources are needed to promote Traveller inclusion in mainstream education.  One size does not fit all.  Another important action in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 is to promote affirmative action opportunities to support Travellers who want to become teachers.  This is essential in promoting positive role models and influencing the culture and ethos of schools.  Direct engagement with Traveller organisations as equal and key partners in the educational system and developing policy is essential.  We have worked with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of the Traveller education strategy.  We do not know the status of this strategy.  The Traveller education consultative forum, or equivalent, needs to be re-established as we do not have forums to feed into policy development with regard to education for Travellers.  We know the issues the community faces and we know what works.<\/p><p> We cannot deal with Traveller education in isolation from poor living conditions, high unemployment, low health status, exclusion and racism.  A multifaceted approach is required.  The NTRIS is designed to do that but its recommendations and implementation plans have yet to be fully realised.  Mainstreaming on its own will not work.  We fully support having targeted special measures to complement the inclusion and participation of Travellers in the mainstream.<\/p><p> I will finish with a quote from Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic woman to be appointed associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, who stated: \"Until we get equality in education, we won't have an equal society.\"  That is very true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collins for sharing that quote, which I think we would all agree with.

The National Traveller Women's Forum is a national network of Traveller women and Traveller women's organisations from throughout Ireland.  We recognise the oppression and racism experienced by Traveller women in Irish society.  There are stark inequalities between Traveller girls and women and the general population in participation, attendance and attainment in education.  This has wider human rights consequences by exposing Traveller girls and women to low educational attainment, future unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  The two key barriers for Traveller women and girls with regard to education are racism and a lack of implementation of positive policy developments.  I will not name them all as they have been identified by previous speakers.  However, while we have policies and actions, we are not seeing implementation or monitoring.<\/p><p>While the committee&rsquo;s role is to examine the progression of Travellers through second level and third level education, it cannot do so in isolation from the very negative experience of many Traveller children in primary school, not just historically but also today.  There is an absence of positive visibility of Traveller culture in the curricula and the whole-school environment.  Bullying and racism are experienced by Traveller learners from their settled peers and also from educators.  Discriminatory practices are still evident such as enrolment processes that exclude Traveller children.  Moreover, as has been said, a growing number of Traveller children are placed inappropriately on shortened and reduced timetables.  This impacts significantly on their educational opportunities and outcomes.  Expectations of Traveller learners are incredibly low.  Transfer rates from primary to second level are less than 100%.  Given that this is illegal, it is an incredible statement to make.  Many Traveller children who have completed eight years in primary school or even secondary school do not know how to read and write.<\/p><p> Based on the data we have from the 2016 census, limited as they are, we know that seven out of ten Traveller children live in families where the mother has either no formal education or a primary education only.  The census also shows that only 13% of Travellers complete secondary education, in comparison with 92% of the general population.  It is essential that Traveller girls be supported in primary and secondary school to ensure opportunities at third level will be taken up, as they are the future mothers and role models who will influence and shape their children's education.  Fewer than 1% of Travellers are in third level education.  Five times more Traveller women than settled women are needed for an equivalent proportion to hold a basic degree.  The attainment and retention levels of Traveller students in second level education should be a source of serious concern for the committee.<\/p><p> I will outline some ways forward.  Proactive initiatives and programmes are needed to support Traveller teachers within the education system.  We welcome the recent scholarship put in place to support them, but it is tiny and a huge amount remains to be done.  As Mr. Collins highlighted, that kind of targeted initiative is also highlighted in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, but implementation and prioritisation are needed.  Traveller children within the school system must see teachers who are the same as them and a curriculum in which they are reflected, rather than solely the wider settled society.  We need to ensure discriminatory practices in schools are identified and swiftly brought to an end.  The process of addressing these practices is too drawn-out and often does not happen at all.  An implementation plan must be developed for all 14 education actions in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy in a real and equal partnership with Traveller organisations.  Outstanding recommendations in the 2006 education strategy should be addressed in a similar manner.  <\/p><p> The reality is that we have policies, but we are not seeing action and implementation.  One of the key reasons is the institutional racism which has been spoken about.  Compulsory anti-racism and intercultural training is required for all teachers as part of pre-service and continuous in-service teacher training.  It should not be an add-on but a core component of training, with visibility of Traveller culture in the curricula.  Appropriate desegregated data collection needs to be prioritised within the education system.  Analysis of the data is needed to ensure targets and actions are having an impact for Traveller women and girls in education and put the necessary appropriate targeted initiatives in place.  There is data collection within the education system, but we are not seeing the statistics and figures from it. <\/p><p> We need adequate resources.  As has been said, there have been huge cuts across the education sector.  They have been combined with the huge cuts across all areas of Traveller life such as accommodation provision and health services.  We need to see practical supports such as uniforms, books and lunches.  Programmes such as the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and the education and training boards need to ensure they are meeting targets set out for Traveller engagement in education, but they are not doing so.  The Higher Education Authority must set ambitious targets for Traveller access to third level education, with a range of supports to ensure the targets are met.  <\/p><p> Third level institutions must build on the knowledge they are developing in their current work with Travellers.  They are beginning to identify and support Traveller learners returning to education, but they must apply that learning in developing stronger links with the community to ensure collective and sustainable outcomes for Travellers in third level education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I wish to make a few brief points.  The National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals is the professional association for second level school leaders.  We have been on record in promoting the role of school leadership in fostering a climate of tolerance in schools.  The NAPD supports inclusive admission policies and school policies.  We are very much in support of the Yellow Flag Programme and representatives from our national executive serve on its steering group.  It is very important that ways are found to cut down on the experience of discrimination faced by Travellers in school.  This does not consist of just bullying and name-calling from students.  We must also recognise that among many members of staff there are unconscious biases that could be reflected in low expectations of the Traveller children in our schools.  We need to put supports in place for parents.  We know the importance of mothers in educational outcomes for their children at second level.  We need to put appropriate supports in place for parents so that they can see the value of continued education for their children.  We feel that it is vital to have good home-school links at second level, recognising the context and the climate of the school itself as experienced by the Traveller children in attendance.  It is vital to highlight the importance of attendance in encouraging achievement and progression. It is important that all students, including Traveller students, experience appropriate curricula and pathways as part of schools' educational offering.  Appropriate pathways for the progression of Traveller students must be put in place.<\/p> <p>  We in the NAPD have articulated our belief that there are too many second level schools and primary schools in the educational system.  If schools were amalgamated it would be possible to offer different subject choices and different programmes.  These could include arts and music programmes.  Moreover, the junior certificate school programme and leaving certificate applied curriculum could be offered in more schools to meet students' particular needs.  The experience colleagues have expressed to me in preparing for today's meeting is that students in primary school seem to get on very well in terms of inclusion and all other aspects until fifth class.  Issues then begin to arise which can cause literacy and numeracy problems as the students go into first and second year at post-primary level. <\/p> <p>  Schools are expected to cope with issues of accommodation, mental health and access to supports to prevent suicide.  We have to recognise the reality of high levels of unemployment in the sector.  It is difficult for schools to be able to do this on their own.  The association calls for the restoration of supports for mainstream schools.  Funding which has been cut should be made available to schools again to reflect the economic reality faced by parents trying to send their Traveller children to schools.  This is particularly relevant to the new initiatives that exist at the moment.  Many of the students live in areas without access to broadband or other technology which is regularly used in schools.  Children face disadvantages at second level by not having a resource teacher or a visiting teacher for Travellers.  Travellers attend all schools, not just those that are part of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  In many instances, the lack of access to home-school liaisons is very important.  Good links between the home and the school go a long way to resolving some of the issues.  Supports from welfare services such as Tusla are also important.  Schools should not have to wait the minimum of 20 days absence before making an announcement or a report to Tusla which can be followed up by the welfare office.  I look forward to exploring some of the other points made in my submission, but these are the key points which I feel should be emphasised in this part of the discussion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clive Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, which is the trade union for primary school teachers, thanks the committee for allowing me to speak this afternoon.<\/p><p>As stated already, austerity measures imposed in 2011 led to a substantial reduction in investment in Traveller education.  As also stated already, there were cuts of almost 87% in that period.  There can be no overstatement of the effect this has had on Traveller citizens in our schools.  Education cuts have a particularly significant impact on Travellers, where participation in education has traditionally been fragile.  In particular, there was expertise and knowledge in the visiting teachers for Travellers, VTTs.  There were approximately 40 of those and they would have spent much time communicating with parents and going to the different houses of pupils.  That was lost to the system.  There were approximately 400 resource teachers for Travellers, RTTs, and the withdrawal of those services has been a noticeable loss to the system.  The visiting teachers offered a specific skill set and had developed an in-depth understanding of the Traveller communities and their culture, providing a valuable liaison between Traveller families and schools in developing relationships and advocacy support.<br\/><br\/>Responding adequately to the particular needs of Traveller pupils continues to concern teachers in both DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  Approximately 50% of pupils from the Traveller community do not attend DEIS schools.  The Department of Education and Skills states that the home school liaison teacher could absorb this work but that is not true.  Home school liaison teachers are not available in non-DEIS schools and are not available in rural DEIS schools either.  Given that only approximately half the Traveller pupil population attend DEIS schools, there is an obvious discrepancy in the system.  Moreover, the home school liaison teacher does not currently have the capacity to fulfil the duties previously held by the visiting teacher service.<br\/><br\/>It is widely acknowledged that Traveller enrolment in education declines as pupils move through the system.  A provision of specific supports and additional resources must be made available to Travellers across the continuum of education from preschool to third level education to ensure that they have the opportunity to participate in our education system on equal terms with the rest of their peers.  As has been stated, it would be wonderful to see primary school teachers from the Traveller community teaching and reflecting the curriculum in schools.  Huge disparities remain between the educational attainment of Travellers and the settled population according to Dr. Cormac Forkan's 2006 work.  The expectation that a school's special education team would be able to fully compensate for the loss of the RTTs is also completely unrealistic.  The needs of Traveller pupils must be clearly reflected in a school's educational profile, which now determines a school's allocation of additional teachers to support special and additional educational needs.<br\/><br\/>There continue to be many barriers for Travellers in education particularly around attendance, retention and completion.  The additional targeted support offered by the VTT and RTT service had a positive impact on Travellers in terms of these key challenges, particularly at primary level.  In 2011, there was confirmation of improved educational enrolment, with 100% of Traveller children being enrolled in primary education.  We doubt that is the case today and, anecdotally, there are reports from teachers that the figure has declined significantly.  There is a need for clear, robust, independent research on the outcomes for Travellers in education following the withdrawal of Traveller-specific supports and the implementation of the Traveller education strategy.<br\/><br\/>The INTO notes the recent announcement by the education welfare service at Tusla<i><\/i>to pilot a project with the aim of improving the inclusion of Travellers in education.  Whereas the move to develop a pilot project is welcome, there remains the need for an immediate response to fill the gap left following the withdrawal of Traveller-specific supports across the system.  A colleague who works in a DEIS school has told me that with the cuts implemented since 2011, it will take at least a generation to undo the damage that has been done.

Much of what is included in my submission has been covered by previous speakers so I will be brief.<\/p> <p>  Our response was submitted as two separate submissions dealing with progression to second level education and progression to third level education, taking in further education and training.  ETBs are statutory authorities with responsibility for education and training, youth work and a range of other statutory functions.<\/p><p>ETBs manage and operate community national schools, second level schools, further education colleges and a range of adult and further education centres in communities throughout Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We looked at progression in preparing for today and there is evidence that members of the Traveller community have access to a range of further education programmes within our ETBs and they are a priority target group in programme planning.  In evaluating the progression of the Traveller community, it is noted that there are high levels of participation recorded within the Youthreach provision.  Youthreach programmes cater for young people over the age of 16 who have dropped out of mainstream education.<br\/><br\/>The challenges of literacy and participation have been mentioned.  Despite literacy levels being frequently cited as low within the Traveller community, participation of this group in literacy and numeracy programmes remains a challenge.  Many of the other programmes delivered in ETBs across the country, like the back to education initiative, skills for work and apprenticeship programmes all aim to support adults who have low education attainment who wish to progress further or to develop personally, but these are still challenged with low participation rates within the Traveller community.  However, some community education programmes are delivered based on the requirements of a community and we see strong and positive engagement in programmes like men's sheds and women's sheds and other areas in the community identifying a need.<br\/><br\/>With respect to second level education, education and training boards have a long-standing tradition of supporting the educational development of members of the Traveller community.  As State schools, ETB schools are open to all pupils, regardless of any aspect of their identity.  Our school cultures are underpinned by the core values of excellence, care, equality, community and being multidenominational.  However, as always, today is a setting providing me the opportunity to learn and be reminded of the issues.  Ongoing research, including evidence from today, indicates that engagement with parents is crucial in order to bring change.  As mentioned earlier, the negative experience of Traveller parents in schools and their possibly low rate of educational attainment are key influencers in determining the progress of their own children.  The links between home and school are crucial.<br\/><br\/>We can look at the barriers to education in further education as cited in a 2017 SOLAS report, which cites low confidence and self-esteem, a negative experience of education, childcare issues, transport, a loss or reduction in benefits, the suitability of courses and a lack of awareness of what is available as barriers.  Many of the barriers contained in the report could also be identified as barriers in post-primary education.  The Action Plan for Education and many Government policy documents outline targets but as was mentioned earlier, some of those targets are not being met.<br\/><br\/>While the participation of the Traveller community is low in some areas, as referenced above, continued engagement with SOLAS, the Department of Education and Skills and key stakeholders, some of whom I have met today, will help in bringing improvements.  There should be consideration of the provision of an allowance on a pilot basis to those programmes that do not currently attract an allowance and interventions need to be in place at the early stage of education and on a continuum to encourage ongoing participation with education.  Clarity should be provided on the retention of social welfare and other benefits, as on occasion, this can result in non-participation in education programmes.  Schools need support in identifying and accessing services and resources beyond those provided by the Department of Education and Skills, and a mapping exercise should be conducted in this regard.  As was mentioned on a number of occasions, there should be training programmes and continuing professional development for teachers.  There should be a reintroduction of a repurposed support officer for Traveller services, thus strengthening the links between home and schools.<i><\/i>There should be a framework to encourage schools, further education and training colleges and centres to evaluate and measure the current practice of engaging and supporting students.  There should be a system for tracking pupils as they go from primary to post-primary levels and on to further and higher education.  There should also be a review of childcare provision to support the Traveller community in accessing education, and we should address the challenge of transport costs in terms of rural provision and access.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage, listen and learn this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nessa White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Ms White for her interesting contribution.<\/p><p>There were many very practical recommendations from the stakeholders.

A few people have mentioned the reinstatement and resourcing of what was there before, as if that was adequate, which does not acknowledge the damage done to the Travelling community since the early 1960s.  We also need to acknowledge that when austerity budgets destroyed aspects of the education system it was a disaster for the Travelling community.  If we are recommending the reinstatement of a visiting teacher the question is whether that was enough.  Are we just saying that is what we had before and we will do the same again, or are we saying Travellers deserve a lot more than this and need a much more targeted approach than was there because it was not working?  It might have been an extra bit of help, an extra resource and that might have been positive but was it achieving the goals the Travelling community needed to achieve?  We should not herald the initiatives that existed before austerity as a golden chalice that was moving the Traveller community through the education system and into third level because I do not think they were.  They were not enough.<\/p> <p>  Funding is given to universities if they increase access for minorities and working class students.  Apart from the Yellow Flag programme and initiatives, what would it be like if there was funding attached to how good a school was at meeting the needs of minority groups such as Travellers or Roma or other ethnicities?  If 50% of those children are not in delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, schools should the funding for special category groups in educational deficit, to follow the children, rather than the schools, from primary to third level education?  Should it focus on families rather than try to recreate something in schools that was not really working in the first place?  Anyone can answer that question. <\/p> <p>  People have got used to the word racism and do not understand what is behind it and the impact it has on people.  People in schools are so afraid of racist attacks that they change their identity.  I have said in the Seanad that my consciousness of this was raised when I went into the home of my friend William, who unfortunately is now dead, and he spoke like a Traveller.  I had been friends with him for 12 years and said I had never heard him speak like that.  It was as if I heard a new person, a side of him that I had been deprived of.<\/p><p>I had been missing out on his culture and identity.  A person tries to go through a system suppressing their identity and then we ask why so many Traveller people die by suicide.  We have completely denied their identity since the 1960s.  There has to be some sort of redress due to them for that. <\/p><p> A person does not have to be inside four walls to be institutionalised.  The State has institutionalised the Travelling community for far too long.  What was there was not good enough even though it might have been a positive resource at the time.  What would the witnesses prefer to do and should the funding follow the child? <\/p><p> I speak to women in my community, not necessarily in the Travelling community, who are really struggling to get their children to go to school past junior certificate level and then the State takes their children's allowance away.  There are groups already living in poverty and this is something that was never supposed to be attached to the educational journey but the State refuses to give them the children's allowance if the child is not in school.  What impact does that have on the poverty of women in the Travelling community?  Are they losing the children's allowance at second level if they cannot get a form stamped in the school to say their children are still attending?  I know that is happening to other groups which increases the levels of poverty in some households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#O00200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I apologise that I will have to go to the D&aacute;il in a few minutes but I will read the responses in the Official Report.  The submissions are very helpful, very clear and concise and there is a lot for us to follow up on.  I will follow up with parliamentary questions, as I am sure my colleagues will do as well.<\/p> <p>  There is not much I disagree with.  Notwithstanding Senator Ruane's comments on the pre-2011 supports, it seems they did some good.  At a minimum I would support bringing them back but I accept what Senator Ruane is saying too.  That probably needs to be considered. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Collins and I corresponded yesterday about Senator Kelleher's Bill and I have discussed these issues with her.  Mr. Collins invited me to ask why that Bill is important to Travellers and the community.  I set out our views publicly; we do not like putting curricula into law even though we support compulsory subjects.  I have no difficulty with this being on the curriculum, I support it, but it is not written into law that any other subject should be on the curriculum.  It is not written into any law that Irish, English or mathematics have to be taught.  Could the witnesses set out the reasons they would support Senator Kelleher's very noble Bill?  I have no difficulty with its principle but legislating for this is a problem.  We have had this problem before, famously with sex education and history.  One of my colleagues wanted to make history compulsory and I said we supported it being compulsory but not in law.  The reason is that it then becomes a political football and other issues come in, as they do around the world.  That is a side issue.  I will follow up on many of the important points the witnesses have raised.  <\/p> <p>  I would like the representatives from the Traveller organisations to respond to a question that arises from Mr. Brougham's submission.  He mentioned that primary enrolment was 100% before 2011 and then it may have dropped, anecdotally.  Do the representative groups have evidence of that or do they support that contention?  Is that correct?  What are the reasons for that?  Does the State have a responsibility to rectify that or are there other reasons that people are not attending primary school?  <\/p> <p>  I am sure the committee will issue a report taking on board what has been said and each party will do its own thing on the issue too. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#P00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and written contributions.  We do need to write a report and to direct a lot of questions to the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>There is no excuse for reducing timetables.  I am not sure who makes those decisions.  Is it the schools?  Where does that decision come from?  We should very clearly state that no school child should have his or her timetable reduced for any reason.  All children should be entitled to the same amount of time in education while in school.  <\/p><p> The yellow flag scheme is a very good one, but it should really be in place in all schools.  Perhaps Ms O'Callaghan could comment on that.  Only a relatively small number of schools participate at the moment, and it is voluntary.  One of the issues that arose was that some schools find ways of making Travellers feel unwelcome, even though they are not supposed to act in such a way under equality legislation.  Schools should not act in this way, but they do.  Perhaps there is a way of putting the principles of the yellow flag scheme into all schools and achieving that culture of inclusivity in all schools.  This does not just apply to Travellers; other groups feel excluded from particular schools.  We all know schools that write it into their enrolment policies even though they are not supposed to.  If the witnesses have any views about how we can achieve a more inclusive culture in all of our schools I would be happy to hear them.  It would address some of the issues raised by Senator Ruane around people feeling that they have to hide their identity.  I support Senator Kelleher's Bill, because until everybody knows about the culture we will always have to deal with ignorant people who do not have knowledge or information about the subject. <\/p><p> The opportunities the witnesses have to consult on this matter and to feed into policy was raised.  Many people also mentioned the implementation of policy.  I believe Ms Joyce said that we have many policies but that we do not have feedback on the implementation of those policies or the information in terms of statistics.  We do not have the data that the witnesses would like us to have.  The national Traveller education strategy is from 2006, and I believe a review is being carried out in the Department at the moment.  Have the witnesses had the opportunity to feed into that review?  Mr. Collins referred to the need for a consultative advisory forum of some kind.  Do the other witnesses agree with that?  Would that be an ongoing engagement between the representative groups and the policy makers and those implementing those policies?  <\/p><p> I believe Senator Ruane referred to bursaries and incentives for staying on in further and higher education.  Perhaps Ms White would have a comment on further education in particular.  Do we have any statistics available in that area?  While we have worrying statistics in terms of transfer from primary to post-primary we also have very low statistics in terms of participation at third level.  We want to see significant progress in that area, but we cannot measure that progress unless we have the statistics.  Many of my questions will have to be raised by this committee elsewhere.  I believe the Higher Education Authority, HEA, is supposed to be carrying out a bursary review; perhaps it will be able to provide numbers on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#P00300","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It is really good to see presentations featuring recommendations, solutions and suggestions; it makes it easier when we are trying to fight for resources.  Many of the questions I was going to ask have been covered, and I do not want to be repetitive.  I totally agree with the idea proposed for the education system.  The classroom can be a very judgmental place, and if one does not fit into a certain category or box school can be a very lonely place.  It leads to people trying to get out of the education system as quickly as possible.  People lose all their confidence in many instances.<\/p><p>It is very damaging.  Children spend a lot of time in school, and face a battle every single day if they do not have a positive experience.  Parents also face a battle in that regard.  They have to send their children to school, and it is not easy sometimes.  We should not underestimate how difficult that is and the wider implications it has for one's entire life and self-confidence, as well as how one sees oneself in the world.  Mr. Brougham made the point that it would take a generation to rectify the cuts.  A bleak picture has been painted today in terms of progression and opportunities.  This committee has to take that on board and perhaps raise the issue at D&aacute;il level via a report.  The witnesses have the answers, and that must be taken on board.  <\/p><p> Could each witness suggest one key starting point?

He mentioned the 80% cut in funding for Traveller education in 2011.  Senator Ruane made the point that that in itself was not a target, but the Government has to address that issue at the very least.  We are now eight years past that date, and have been told that the economy is flying and that we have the fastest growing economy in Europe.  It is time for our citizens to see the benefits of that.  <\/p> <p>  The statistics speak for themselves.  Only 13% of Travellers complete secondary education, as compared to 92% of the settled community.  Mr. Collins summed up the matter for many people.  We are discussing attempts to increase education for the Travelling community.  All of society would benefit from increased education in this area.<\/p> <p>  Some of the points that jumped out at me include the importance of having teachers from the Traveller community.  What can we do to encourage children and young adults from the Traveller community to take up teaching?  Are there any incentives we can put in place to address that?  <\/p> <p>  The home is vitally important for all our children, be they Travellers or otherwise.  There is no doubt that Traveller children are very much at a disadvantage in that respect.  What can we do or what incentives can be put in place to encourage parents to re-engage, or engage for the first time, with education?  What the child is taught in the home has serious implications for the child going forward.  What measures can we put in place to address that particular issue?  People spoke about the facilities available and the obstacles that Traveller families come up against by simply trying to get their children to school in the morning.  They might not have transport, or access to broadband might be non-existent, or costs associated with schooling might be prohibitive.  Would some form of breakfast club or after-school facility, where children from the Traveller community could get targeted attention, help to address the issue?<\/p><p>What are the thoughts of the witnesses on this?  Deputy Byrne asked me to mention the reduction in timetables.  Are there case studies on this that would help us?  I acknowledge the work done by my colleague in the Seanad, Senator Colette Kelleher, on this issue.

Much of what I was going to ask has been asked.  Ms White of ETBI spoke about the payment of an allowance for some classes.  Is this similar to the Youthreach programme?  Would students in mainstream education get an allowance?  I read the submission from the Presentation Secondary School in Limerick, which I know well from having visited on several occasions, and I noted with interest that it pointed out that because some of the parents do not have a high standard of education it is not a priority for the school-going children because there is no encouragement from the parents.  Another school in Limerick attended by a number of Traveller children brought the parents into the system.  They got them engaged in the board of management and worked with them in a think tank.  They ran classes for parents with numeracy and literacy problems to encourage them to work with their children.  This was a good way to integrate them.  I worked with the Traveller committee during the ten years I was a member of the local authority.  There was a lot of good interaction between both sides.  Some of the cuts made must be looked at.  We need to encourage the Department to reinstate some of the supports that were in place because they were working at one stage but now they are not.  Encouraging the parents to get involved in the school might be a way to start and I would like to hear the comments of the witnesses on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#S00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for giving time to this pressing issue.  Every time I look at the statistics and consider them they continue to shock me.  I do not think we can in any way as a society, committee or Oireachtas be satisfied with what is happening.  The presentations have been excellent and very constructive, and it is nice that the Traveller culture, history and education have been endorsed.  Deputy Byrne and I might disagree on the tactics but tomorrow we will speak with Traveller advisers and activists who will be advising on the national curriculum for assessment.  This would not have happened without the Bill.  We may disagree on what should or should not be on curricula.  It is terrible that it takes a Bill to get this level of attention.<\/p> <p>  The statistics are worth repeating as they are compelling.  Ms Joyce drew attention to the fact that 13% of Travellers complete secondary education as opposed to 92% in the general population, with 1% in third level and 167 Travellers ever in third level education.  We speak about Traveller teachers.  They require third level education so what hope do we have of making progress until this is addressed?  It is very concerning that the transfer from primary level to second level has fallen from 100% to 80%.  This tells us something.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the teaching profession's responsibilities and role in all of this.<\/p><p>I would like the witnesses to think about what report card they would give themselves.  Would it be an A+ or an F?  When I look at the statistics I must say it would have to be a fail and not a pass.  I would like to hear particularly from Mr. Byrne because principals and deputy principals have responsibilities in making decisions on reduced timetables, an issue raised by Mr. Joyce.  Where does the buck stop?  Will people here give an undertaking that this practice will be eradicated and eliminated without waiting for the Department of Education and Skills or a Bill to be told to do it?<\/p><p> In terms of the Traveller culture and history, there are ways and means that schools can do now what the Bill proposes but it is just that it is not happening.  We have to go to extraordinary efforts to make sure ordinary things happen for children, such as finishing primary school and secondary school and going to university.  These are ordinary things.  I would like to hear specifically from Mr. Byrne, Mr. Brougham and ETBI.  Youthreach is fine but it is an exceptional service.  It is great that it works for some Traveller children but it should not be the norm.  We have to have an urgency about this.  I am interested to hear about what training teachers need so they know how to make schools warm and welcoming places where Traveller children will want to go and where they can thrive alongside children from settled backgrounds so we can make a society that is inclusive and not exclusive or segregated.<\/p><p> I am a visiting guest to the committee and not a member, but I know it will make strong recommendations about the role of the teaching profession and raising its game.

Most of the issues have been addressed by my colleagues.  We know a number of statistics from the 2016 census that are horrific.  Only 13% of Travellers complete secondary education in comparison with 92% of the general population.  Less than 1%, I think it was only 41 last year, are in third level education.  Some 17.7% of Travellers have no formal education whatsoever, compared with 1.4% of the general population.  As Deputy Gino Kenny said, the statistics speak for themselves.  Anecdotally, we know that an increasing number of Traveller students are leaving schools with poor numeracy and literacy skills.  What can we do, not just in terms of making sure the resources are there but also in terms of monitoring this on an ongoing basis?  That is very important if we are to get some progression.<\/p> <p>  A number of people have spoken about discrimination within schools.  Certainly the Yellow Flag works around that.  I agree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that we need to see it in more schools.  Are there other initiatives that the witnesses feel would be helpful?  There was also comment about the relationship between early years education and future life outcomes.  We know from the research that the longer somebody spends in education, the better health outcomes they will have and the longer they will live.  They will also have better opportunities of attracting employment.  Would it be useful to have an extra year of early education for Traveller children?  Pavee Point identified weak engagement between education providers and Traveller society.  That should be addressed.  Would Pavee Point like to make any other comment on it?<\/p> <p>  Some of the other submissions from people who are not here today raised the issue of gender roles.  Ms Joyce would refer to this also.  It is important.  I have spoken to teachers who have experience teaching girls and boys from the Travelling community.  They see this as a major issue.  They have a very good relationship.  One of the teachers is a home school liaison teacher who has a fantastic relationship with many of the Traveller mothers who want the best for their children.  They say, however, that there is the issue about wanting their daughters to get married at an early age and not seeing other opportunities for them as also being viable.  It is about how we try to address those issues.  I agree with the possibility of funding following children.  That 50% of our students are in non-DEIS schools definitely is a problem.  We should have more resources.  The capitation grant for Traveller children is far too low.  It is only &euro;240 per child unless there is a special class, but it is two to three times lower than grants for other vulnerable children.  That should be one of the recommendations we would make.<\/p> <p>  If witnesses have any thoughts on anything the members have said, we would like to hear them.

I agree.  Making school an environment where people want to go irrespective of their background is what we are all about.  That is what we do and what we should be doing.  One of the questions was what our starting point would be.  I love these opportunities to hear about initiatives like Yellow Flag.  I am not in the role a long time and it is something I was not aware of.  For me, that is a starting point to explore and to follow up from today in response to the question of how we can expand that and make it happen.<\/p> <p>  I will try to cover all the questions and ask the members to come back to me if I have missed one.  The issue around timetabling again is certainly new to me.  It is certainly not a position that the ETB sector or ETB schools take when it comes to how we deal with things, because it is not dealing with things.  I will certainly explore that to see the situation in our sector.  It is certainly new to me today.  On continuing professional development, CPD, for teachers, this is a very good example that I can add to a list of examples of areas in which we need to provide CPD.  In ETBI, we are very well placed to provide that for our sector and it is something that can be delivered upon.  There are many other areas, like a multidenominational approach to making school a welcoming environment, where we can tie in all of these things as a good practice approach to how we look after children in our schools.  That is something I will be taking from today to address the real challenges that have been outlined by people in our schools and all schools, but also to support the teachers who sometimes just do not know and sometimes bring their unconscious bias to interactions they have.  It is about acknowledging the good work that is being done by our teachers and acknowledging that sometimes there needs to be support in terms of CPD to change what we are trying to change.  I certainly can take that on board and will do something in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the incentives and what they would look like, I agree with the point that Youthreach should not be the norm.<\/p><p>Youthreach is put up as an example of what works, and absolutely it works, but if our system was working, Youthreach would be plan B for children of any background who need it.  That is what it should be.  All the initiatives, action plans and policy documents we have need to be implemented to make it plan B for everyone and not simply a plan B that we have put up as a gold star towering achievement.  I take that on board.<\/p><p> Reference was made to reinstatement from the level of cutbacks.  It is valid to point out that we think sometimes that going back to what we had is all we should expect.  It was certainly a learning point for me in the sense that sometimes we need to think differently.  The idea that because we had something does not mean it worked anyway.  It is certainly something we might consider and add in to something that we could bring back to the committee, especially if there were different thoughts around the bigger picture and looking forward rather than looking back.<\/p><p> Reference was made to education and training boards being well placed to deliver quickly, and we heard the suggestion of collaboration at school level with parents.  Literacy and numeracy services go hand in hand with what we are trying to do.  We could implement pilots and initiatives quickly in that area.  If it could work, why not try to do it?  It is a very good idea and something that I am going away with.  I do not think I can change the world, but much of what has been recommended is practical and we can explore it.  I had the opportunity to meet, listen and talk to some of the other stakeholders who know better than I ever would what will and will not work.  There will be follow-up with the stakeholders outside of this environment to look at some practical pilots and some measurement.  Mr. Collins said to me that we need to get better at measuring whether policy is working.  We put it up there as something we have done but we do not really get to the point of measurement.  That is where we are moving to in our sector.  We like to talk about good practice.  Baselines and measurement are the only way to know whether something is good or working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Nessa White","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>As a school principal, an educator and especially as a trade unionist, I consistently strive, as does the teaching profession, and work at trying to make schools as inclusive as possible.  Of course we do not always succeed because these are complex issues.  Educators must not be hypocritical and must be open to listening to advice from wider society and communities.  We must listen and learn because that is the nature of our profession.  There is nothing a teacher wants more than to make the experience of education as beneficial and positive as possible for the members and pupils they teach.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Funchion asked about some of the practical issues to take from listening to everyone today.  When we consider the restoration from the level of cuts, one of the key things we are talking about is trying to respond to and understand a community.  The visiting teacher worked at different levels as a bridge between schools and the wider Traveller community.  It was about the chance to break down some of those barriers.  When that was taken out of the system, it had an effect on those schools with some of the issues we are talking about now.  This is especially relevant if parents had a bad experience at school, because the visiting teacher was able to relay that directly to the school whereas the home school liaison teacher has not had years of experience doing that.  The role was simply cut overnight and that had a dramatic effect.<\/p> <p>  The idea of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is wonderful.  I am involved with the Irish National Teachers Organisation in a project called global citizenship school.  We are trying to promote all social justice and human rights issues in programmes.  We are trying to embed these in the curriculum.  I am 100% supportive of the Yellow Flags project because it is a great idea.<\/p> <p>  I was reflecting on an idea before I came to the meeting today.  It dawned on me as a teacher of 30 years that I do not think I ever taught a lesson on the Traveller community.<\/p><p>It is really only when a teacher is hit with that and then a person comes from the community that the teacher will question himself.  That is quite stunning.  I must have taught thousands of lessons over the years on all kinds of issues and all types of countries and yet the topic was never in a book that I either chose to or had to deliver to a class.<\/p><p> Reference was made to grants following the children.  The school I work for in Ayrfield is not part of the Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, programme.  One particular cut was implemented and there has been little talk of it being restored.  As a non-DEIS school, we used to get a grant to help supplement children who we believed were in need.  That is something to be looked at when we are looking at the 50% of schools that are non-DEIS.  Reference has been made to how the capitation grant only covers 80% of the heating and insurance costs in a school.  Restoration of a particular grant earmarked to help children who need greater access to the curriculum is worth considering.<\/p><p> Reference was made to how we were not exactly in nirvana in 2011.  It is certainly better now although child poverty rates have risen 11% since those cuts.  I am unsure whether that is a direct result.<\/p><p> A suggestion was made about some element of the visiting teacher for Travellers service.  It is important regardless of whether we increase the number of home school liaison teachers or by providing other ways of getting out and bringing the community into the school or bringing the school out to the community and bridging those gaps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal Brougham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies and Senators for their comments and questions.  I am grateful for the endorsement of teachers but I am not too precious as a leader of second level schools to pretend that issues will not arise from time to time.  In any event, the endorsement of the teaching profession by the committee is good because, by and large, we do very good work in our schools.<\/p> <p>  Many of the members expressed surprise about the issue of reduced timetables.  In my opening remarks I mentioned how, from what we could glean from our commentary with second level principals and deputy principals and their links, there seems to be good interaction with Traveller students at primary level until fifth class.  At that stage it seems issues of attendance or discipline begin.  These are mainly to do with puberty or growing.  In any event, by the time the student comes to second level if he or she was in a situation involving a reduced timetable, the chances are it was because of emotional or behavioural difficulties or anger management issues within the school.  In many instances, a reduced timetable would be agreed between the school and the educational welfare service or National Educational Psychological Service.  What we do not want is for that to become the norm.  It should only be for a reduced or short period.  It should not be seen as nirvana to have the child on the school books but not to be benefitting from the system.  It is important that most of the students on reduced timetables are working on particular individual plans to ensure they are getting back to the full timetable.  Irish education is characterised in some schools by competition rather than collaboration when it comes to admission policies, soft barriers and so on.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ruane is absolutely right about supports that existed in 2011.  How much has changed in Ireland since then?  My view is that we need to consider whether something is named in the context of education and how things have not moved on in recent years if the needs of the Traveller community are to be seen as a priority within the system.  If particular resources are allocated, they can be quantified and judged to see if they need to be adapted.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Funchion referred to nirvana earlier.  I would like to see our society and schools being governed by inclusion.  We should have a positive climate of respect for everyone within schools, but we need to look at it.  I wore another hat as chairperson of the board for senior cycle in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.<\/p><p> In another context and wearing another hat, I worked as the chair of the board for senior cycle in the NCCA.  The level of consultation that has taken place with the various education partners is designed to try to bring about a senior cycle that meets our needs for the students in our society in the current climate.  The level of subjects we have, where success at leaving certificate level is seen as one's ability to get through a leaving certificate and move on to third level, will not meet the needs of the Traveller children in our system.  We must look to put in place the necessary supports to encourage home-school links where education is valued.<\/p><p> I was very taken by what my colleagues on my right said about the influence and the educational attainment of mothers.  Students feel discriminated in their schools because they cannot associate with their own culture.  The Senator's Bill is welcome in that regard.<\/p><p> Deputy Byrne's point about putting it into law or making it compulsory is another issue.  I hope I have explained to members that the reduced timetable is used as a mechanism to try to cope with a particular issue when it arises, largely due to emotional or behavioural difficulties within the schools, and should never be seen as long term.  As an association we look to use the educational supports and the resources of Tusla and NEPS to make sure that an individual plan is put in place to meet the needs of every student, Traveller or non-Traveller.  I assure members there are far more non-Traveller children operating on reduced timetables than there are Traveller children but it should never be seen as the norm.<\/p><p> I agree with the points made by Deputy O'Sullivan that the number of schools participating in the Yellow Flag project must be much greater.  From our point of view, we have participated in the steering committee and we are very active in the Yellow Flag project but it is inherently difficult to get school leaders - principals or deputy principals - to be willing to become involved in the project because of a lack of recognition and resources from the Department of Education and Skills.  If the Department was to recognise that as an important initiative to promote the Traveller culture within schools, as part of Senator Kelleher's proposals on Traveller culture, their lifestyle and circumstances, that would be very welcome.<\/p><p> The biggest issue is coping with the invisible discrimination and our own unconscious biases.  Whether it is through continuing professional development, CPD, within the education and training boards, ETB, sector or within the Teaching Council through its Cos&aacute;n framework, and its involvement in CPD in the coming years, it should be possible to raise the issue of bias and unconscious bias within our education system and tackled within that.<\/p><p> That type of bias against Travellers is becoming an issue for students of different races - the new Irish and so on - in other parts of the country.  It is difficult for schools to cope with that issue.  In many instances, integration issues within our schools are key challenges that school leaders are having to tackle.  Much of the difficulty is that it is not named or spoken of and, as a result, we try to move things around because that is what we do in education in Ireland in many instances.  Issues are because they have always been thus, but Ireland is a different society now.  We have to have a vision for society that promotes the values we want from our young citizens leaving schools and entering society.  If we are not in a position to help our indigenous Travellers cope better within our school structures, it will be very difficult for us to move within the changes that may come.<\/p><p> In doing research for this presentation, I found that there are more than 30,000 Travellers in Ireland, more than 10,000 of whom are in the labour market.  There are high instances of unemployment and so on.  In many instances, Travellers do not see the benefits of what they can get through education and training.  We need to make that very clear within schools so that we can encourage people to buy into it.<\/p><p> There was a meeting last Friday about the ongoing review of the Traveller and Roma communities at which our organisation was represented.  I hope that will quantify the issues that need to be tackled.  Given that is a Department of Education and Skills initiative, I hope there will be progress within that.<\/p><p> Colleagues mentioned bursaries and other such areas.  On the payment of an allowance for programmes, that is a good development but it is also a bad one because if Traveller children are not happy in school, there is almost an incentive for them to move into a programme where there is a payment of an allowance rather than stay on in formal education.  They do not have experience of the concept of deferred gratification in that if they stay in the education sector they will be able to get a better job.  One of the briefing documents from my colleagues outlined people's aspirations to work as farriers, with other animals or to get involved in sports such as boxing and so on.  All those issues are setting the barrier very low.  Even though the numbers are small, we know from the quality of Travellers who have moved on to further and higher education that when they are offered the opportunity, it is important that they are able to take it and act as role models.  On the point Senator Kelleher made, if only 100 plus people from the Traveller community have got involved in higher education, it is difficult to see how we could incentivise people to become involved in the teaching profession.<\/p><p> I have gone on a good while.  I am not sure if I answered all the questions or addressed the comments made but I am conscious of our colleagues who want to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clive Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>If we want change in education, we need to be honest about the realities of the education system today with regard to Traveller children.  I will make a point about teachers.  In the earlier part of his contribution, Mr. Byrne spoke about the principals and recognised the bias that can exist among teachers in their views of the Traveller children in front of them.  As a Traveller woman who went through the education system in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a Traveller mother who put her child through the education system in the 1990s and 2000s, I know there is blatant racism among some teachers in those education systems.  I have had to listen to my son tell me that a teacher in the school told him to go home and take off his knacker's dog chain because he had a thin bracelet on his arm.<\/p> <p>  Based on my work in our organisation and listening to Traveller women who are engaging in those spaces at local and national level, I know I am not unique in that view.  There are many examples of Traveller children in the education system experiencing racism and discrimination.  That is the reality.  I am not saying every teacher is doing that but there are many examples of Traveller children having that experience in schools today.  If we are being honest about the realities of the situation, one of the key barriers across the board in terms of education, and other areas of policy, is the issue of racism.  We cannot do the change of addressing those conditions in isolation.<\/p> <p>  There are challenges within the community but it is unfair to say that Travellers do not see value in education.  Travellers are not seeing outcomes from education in terms of employment or further opportunities, whether it be in education or elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  We are beginning to see Traveller children coming through secondary school and when that trend starts to happen, it usually picks up, grows and more and more children come through.  In some families it is harder to get younger siblings to the end of that process because they are seeing older siblings coming through the secondary school system with no outcomes from that system.<\/p> <p>  We have to be very careful that in the work we are doing we do not generalise or stereotype.  There are challenges within the community but we need to be very careful that we do not blame the community because of the reality of the education system.  Questions arise if one child from a group of children comes through an education system without being able to read and write.  I refer to a group of children going through the entire primary school system and coming out unable to read or write.<\/p><p>That is the responsibility of the education system.  Let us be frank about that.  I spoke earlier about women and girls going through education as role models.  I want to be clear in that context that the majority of Traveller women we engage with and who engage with schools want their children to have a good education.  They want them in the education system and they want them to get through it.  The reality is, however, that they are not seeing the fair and real outcomes they should be getting in employment, as I said.<\/p><p> We need to be careful that the community does not get blamed here.  The conditions need to be created from early school right up to further and continuing education at third level to address this.  There is a need for targeted initiatives right across the board.  Someone asked earlier if there was an additional school year for younger Traveller children.  Targeted initiatives and ensuring they are appropriately and adequately resourced is very important.  We do not want a segregated provision.  We have had that as Travellers and it has not worked for us.  As someone who has come through Traveller-only classes in schools, I am telling the committee it has not worked for us.  Albeit I have gone though third level, segregated provision has not worked in the main for Travellers.  However, we need targeted initiatives.  One cannot mainstream if everyone is not at an equal starting point.  Travellers are not at that equal starting point which is why targeted initiatives are needed across the board.  Scholarships and bursaries are needed for Traveller teachers.  We have Travellers teachers.  I do not doubt that there are Traveller teachers out there.  However, the reality is that they are not identifying as Travellers, which tells one all about conditions for Travellers who have gone through and are in teaching spaces.  I heard a Traveller woman speak in the Houses of the Oireachtas when we were looking at the recognition of Traveller ethnicity about a cousin who was a school principal and petrified it would become known that she was a Traveller.  That is the reality of it.  Those conditions are not conducive.  Racism and discrimination feeds into that which make those conditions continue.<\/p><p> There is a need for implementation.  We have a range of actions.  While we may need more, the reality is that if we implemented what we had, we would at least begin to see the change that is needed.  Most important is implementation and monitoring.  The role of data in that context is crucial and our access to that data is equally important.  The ethnic identifier at primary level needs to be right through the system but there needs to be serious additions to it and the training attached to all of it.  The engagement with Traveller organisations must be real and meaningful.  A question was asked earlier regarding the review of the education strategy.  As far as I am aware, a desk review is taking place and we are led to believe there will be some engagement with Traveller organisations around it.  That engagement must be real and meaningful.<\/p><p> Senator Ruane mentioned the punishment related to the children's allowance.  I will need to check that.  A stick approach to penalising the community does not work when the conditions are not in place to ensure equality of access at the school door and to ensure participation and outcomes.  A transfer rate from primary to secondary school of 80% when the majority of children are in and around the age of 12 and the legal age to be in school in this country is 16 is very telling about an education system that is failing to meet the needs of an entire group of people.  It is happening.  Schools say there are no places, do not offer them or offer them where it is inappropriate for the children to go.  Those practices need to be stamped out.  An 80% transfer rate from primary to post-primary level is not the fault of the parents in all those circumstances.  We have seen countless examples of schools refusing to accept children.  That is the reality of it.  The greater element of that statistic arises on foot of that practice as opposed to any kind of parental involvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>As I said as part of the opening statement, there is a wider context to Traveller access to education at all levels.  We need a multifaceted approach to deal with poor living conditions.  Many Travellers are living on the side of the road or on sites with no access to water, electricity or sanitation.  Despite those very difficult circumstances, they are making tremendous efforts to get up in the morning and get their children ready for school.  That has to be recognised.  There is ambition there and a general feeling that education is important.  It is valued.  It is important to challenge the myth or stereotype that Travellers are uninterested in education and lack ambition.  We do not lack ambition; we lack opportunities.  Quite often, these opportunities are subject to what one might define as racism at both the individual and institutional level.  There has been no acknowledgement of the fact that we have an educational system that promotes an ideology of homogeny.  It reflects only one world view and does not encompass respect for cultural or human difference.  That is why I commend Senator Kelleher on spearheading the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 which will have a profound impact when it is implemented in schools.  It should be compulsory.  I disagree with Deputy Byrne.  Compulsory is compulsory.  If that means putting it on a legislative basis, that is what it means.  If there is no legislative basis to it, it is not compulsory; it is discretionary.  Teachers and principals could decide whether to implement it.  That goes back to the point that we need an institutionalised policy response to creating an inclusive educational context for Travellers.  We have very sympathetic teachers and principals.  We at Pavee Point get invitations all the time, more than the other Traveller groups, to attend schools for a human rights day or to talk with staff.  That is not sustainable however.  We are an NGO with few resources.  As such, we need an embedded culture of respect for human rights and diversity built into our curriculum.  That requires anti-racism and intercultural training in the teacher training colleges.<\/p> <p>  Someone asked me recently about education and how one knows one has made a difference or achieved success.  I measure it as follows.  Recently, Sindy Joyce received her PhD from the University of Limerick.  It was a great achievement for her personally and for her family.  Why are we celebrating that, however?  Why is it so special?  Why has Sindy been on so many chat shows, radio shows and in the media?  We should not be at that stage.  We should be beyond that to where it is the norm that Travellers graduate from universities with diplomas, degrees and PhDs.  It is a very sad indictment of society that we are still at the stage of rejoicing in these types of achievement.  While they are, of course, important, we need to move beyond that.  Schools are not a very welcoming place.  It is a microcosm of the wider society in terms of racism and discrimination.<\/p> <p>  I will finish on this point.  When he was sitting his leaving certificate in Rathoath community college, my own son was called a \"knacker\" on three different occasions.  This was right in the middle of his leaving certificate and he came home very emotional and upset.  The school did not deal with it properly.  I have always taught my son to be very dignified in fighting racism.  The third time, he lashed out.  I do not condone it, obviously.  My wife and I were summoned to the school by the principal and what came across at the meeting was that the racism was marginalised and got lost.  What became the focus was this stereotype of a young, aggressive male Traveller.  That became the focus and I found myself getting really frustrated.  There are those issues that need to be contended with.<\/p> <p>  There are two things that need to happen.  What we had before or its equivalent must be re-established.  We have no mechanism to be involved in consultation on Traveller education policy with the Department of Education and Skills.  We need a forum or other mechanism to engage with the Department.  We have that lived experience and know what works.  We must be allowed to inform policy development and implementation.  I was disappointed to hear that there was a meeting last week on the review of the Traveller education strategy to which no Traveller organisation was invited.  Certainly, we were not at Pavee Point.  It is indicative of the systemic problems we are having with the Department of Education and Skills, in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#BB00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I will try to address the specific questions of relevance to the Yellow Flag programme.  Senator Ruane commented on the visiting teacher-Traveller service.  She asked whether it was the right thing to revisit and what supports were involved.  Mr. Brougham addressed that very well and indicated the service was in place to bridge a gap.<\/p><p>However, other supports are needed to target the majority communities and schools as the delivery point of the institution of education.  That Yellow Flag programme has a multi-layered or an eight-step approach which seeks to do that.  In that respect, we are examining both the activities within the school and within the curricular programme and how well informed teachers are in that regard, what celebratory activities are in place, as well as what is being done at a management and policy level.  This is the idea of asking the schools to review their policies on bullying but also on anti-racism and to develop anti-racism policies.  We are trying to address this at a number of levels.  <\/p><p> I acknowledge what Mr. Clive Byrne said about leadership within the schools.  Where we meet principals who are open to achieving a culture of change within their school, is where the Yellow Flag programme is most effective.  Usually what follows from that is that if the teachers within the school are open to saying that something about their system needs to change and if that is their starting point, they will achieve change.  That is really important and that having a several stranded approach works to that.<\/p><p> To address Senator Byrne's point on involving the parents in the school, that is a step within the Yellow Flag programme.  We invite all parents, particularly parents of minority ethnic children, to join the diversity committee, which takes a leadership position in the school.  It is made up of mostly students together with teachers and parents, and Traveller parents are invited on to that.  We also promote that schools engage with the Traveller community locally so that they engage with Traveller parents but not in the sense of addressing individual issues relating to their children but by talking and developing relationships over time.  Senator Gallagher mentioned the development of relationships that are properly about listening to what those families need.  Where those relationships develop in schools is where we are seeing outcomes.  Where relationships have been built up year on year between the Traveller community through the parents and through Traveller representative organisations in local areas, of which there are many across the country so it is possible to develop those relationships, change can happen.<\/p><p> When Mr. Clive Byrne spoke about issues arising at fifth class level, it occurred to me that they may not relate only to puberty concerns as this is when bullying starts to become a big feature, as does the issue of identity.  Children reach the age where they recognise their identity and that it differs from other people's identity.  We have asked the schools to survey their students and their parents about their experiences in school and if they or their children have had experiences of racism.  We have found that \"Yes\" is always the answer.  During the past two years, 31% to 35% of children who took part in those surveys reported experiencing racism and a very high number reported that it was a regular occurrence.  As is the case throughout our society, racism is prevalent in schools at every level.  We find it surprising that schools often are totally amazed by the results of those surveys and they do not want to believe that it is true.  This is something teachers need to understand and they need support to understand it.  <\/p><p> We have built up many relationships with teachers in schools over the past ten years of working on the Yellow Flag programme.  We have found that teachers reflect everybody in society.  They range from being people who are open and have some awareness to people who are closed-minded and believe that is the way it is.  Because awareness raising around interculturalism or understanding equality is not a part of or indeed compulsory at the teacher training level, sometimes those issues are not addressed.  We find that even where teachers want to be supportive, they have quite paternalistic attitudes towards Travellers.  Some of what we are all talking about today is about the expectations of Travellers.  People have very prejudiced expectations of Travellers.  Their expectations for them are not high.<\/p><p>They do not expect Travellers to achieve the same educational outcomes.  That can be found to be a feature across the board within the education system and it is something we need to address.  Many of us in different parts of the organisations would say those are the things we want to address.  <\/p><p> Training is a big part is of what the Yellow Flag programme seeks to achieve.  It is a step within the programme but it is only a two-hour training session within the schools.  All the schools tell us it is not enough, that they really like the training and want more of it.  We have developed a different tool to add on to that training, which is a 30-minute six-step module on self-awareness training for teachers.  All adults and people within the school system can access it.  It is about looking at one's own self in terms of prejudice and bias.  This is a feature we have just added to the Yellow Flag programme to address that issue.  It facilitates people in looking at their own value system, at any prejudice and bias they may have and at what we are talking about, whether it be institutional or unconscious biases.  We believe it will be of help and we can make it available to schools that have the Yellow Flag programme.  <\/p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan will be aware of the Yellow Flag programme.  We have been seeking resources for many years to continue it and to grow it.  Our vision is that the programme would be included in every school across the country.  We believe it should be targeted at not only schools that have high levels of diversity or at DEIS schools, which are the schools that tend to apply to us for it because they need it,  but that every school in the country should be able to access it.  It an issue of resources.  We are conscious there is a great deal of solidarity among the organisations in support for the Yellow Flag programme, including, politically, among members of the committee.  We are seeking opportunities to continue to grow the programme into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elva O'Callaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Callaghan for that.

As non-governmental organisations, NGOs, we are constantly reaching out and working with agencies.  We are always seeking to highlight the issues but also to bring forward tangible solutions.  In some ways we have been very innovative and creative in doing that.  The Yellow Flag programme is an example of that in terms of examining racism within the education system.  We have also examined other areas in terms of addressing some of the issues that underpin inequality in Ireland.  I would have to bring the discussion back to the historic context of Travellers' segregation, which I would equate to apartheid in South Africa.  That was not 100 years ago; that was during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and even today, there are some schools that are still Traveller specific.  That should not be accepted in any circumstances.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Maria Joyce pointed out, and we are of a similar generation, we have found ourselves in segregated schools in the past, in special classes with special resources.  The expectations of us during that time were very low in that there was no requirement on us to fufill the whole junior certificate or leaving certificate curriculum.  As a father of five children of different ages, I note that today we still see the low expectations of our children today but we also see their confidence being completely diminished when they go school because they find their identity is not acknowledged.  They do not feel school is an inclusive, safe environment.  They cannot self-identify.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of identifying some of the key areas that we would press, I would say that every child needs to feel valued and important and to have a sense of fulfilment and satisfaction.  They need to feel that they are a part of and embedded in society but also that their culture is very important not only to them but to their peers, their teachers and society in general, but unfortunately that is the case now.<\/p><p>That is a fundamental element in terms of the prejudices that exist within wider society.  Mr. Collins has pointed out that even before reaching school, many children live in substandard, inhumane conditions, without water, electricity or sanitation.  They are in temporary accommodation and yet their mothers and fathers bring their children to school every day because they have belief and want their children to succeed.  They want them to have the opportunities they did not have and to do the junior or leaving certificate, but they encounter many barriers and challenges when trying to succeed.  What is expected of them remains so low and there is a view that Travellers will not be able to fulfil requirements or achieve different objectives, which stems from the fact that only 167 Travellers have obtained a third level education.  On top of that, there have been cuts of 87%.  While there are issues such as racism, the cuts were significant, not least on the level of progression through primary and post-primary education, as well as on the level of third level education.  Today, 82% of Travellers are unemployed.  The situation is at crisis point.  In addition, the turnover from primary to post-primary again has been reduced significantly.  We are concerned that the strategies, policies, resources and everything else have not progressed in the way that we would like.  I am also concerned that there could be a review of the education strategy without Traveller representation.  Perhaps there has been such representation but we would need clarification in that regard.<\/p><p> In future, there must be clear, tangible recommendations with clear outcomes for Traveller education, and the inclusion of Traveller culture within the education curriculum is fundamental.  We have spoken about the ethnicity status of Travellers being granted in 2017 and the symbolic statement, but that statement must now become meaningful both to our children for the future and to the wider society, given that there still seems to be a lack of understanding of Traveller history and culture.  The onus has always been on us to deliver that message but, in future, that message should be delivered not by us but by the curriculum, in which it should be embedded.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members and the Oireachtas for giving us the opportunity to attend today.  We look forward to working with the committee and others in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Joyce.

It is my honour to be here today to speak about my views of the education system as a young Traveller doing the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  Merlin College is a great school with a fantastic atmosphere where there is a genuine respect between students and teachers.  I have received much encouragement and help from my teachers, as well as from my scholar&rsquo;s den homework club which I attend every day.  It provides a study area for Traveller children.<\/p> <p>  In January 2016, I became the first Traveller to ever take part and to win an award at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, winning second prize in the biological and ecological category.  My project was entitled, Does the lunar cycle play a role in equine birth patterns?<\/p> <p>  In January 2017, I won an award at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, winning the Jack Restan award.  My project looked at the cures and folklore of the Irish Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of years, I have been campaigning for more speed ramps and play facilities in my local area in Galway city.  This gave me a great interest in the world of politics.  I am hoping in the coming years to become a member of government and to be able to give the people the voice they need.<\/p> <p>  I am proud to be a Traveller.  I hope that being recognised as an ethnic minority will enable other young and old Travellers to feel proud of their identity.  I hope that after being recognised as ethnic minority that our Traveller culture, language and history will be taught in schools and will bring about positive changes for the future.  The Yellow Flag has been a great part of our school not just for the Traveller community but for all communities.<\/p> <p>  Up to 13% of Traveller children complete second level education compared to 92% in the general population.  Of those Travellers who drop out of second level education, 55% have left by the age of 15.  The number of Traveller children who progress to third level education represents just 1% of the Traveller community.  The majority of Travellers, 70%, have only primary or lower levels of education.<\/p><p>My dream is to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I say that as a young Traveller who is open about saying that I am a Traveller.  Travellers exist in all aspects of work but some of them are afraid to open up because they do not know what will be said about them in their jobs.  As a young Traveller, I feel that paints a bad picture, leading to Travellers being further marginalised in society.<\/p><p> Traveller children's futures depend entirely on them and their increasing participation in education and the workforce, which must be seen as a priority.  For me, education has built self-confidence, awareness and an ability to participate in society.  Low levels of education may lead to poor self-esteem, poor job opportunities, poor health and depression, the level of which, as the committee will be aware, is seven times higher among those in the Traveller community.  The answer to why Traveller people suffer from depression is that they are not educated.  We Traveller children need to stay in school and progress.  Someone might say that he or she has been through school and does not feel wanted, but we need to stay on the ground and wait there because we are giving other people the opportunity to take it away from us.  We do not take it away from them and, therefore, they should not take it away from us.  That is why I remain in school and why I will keep standing on the ground.  I do not care if I do not fit into the stew of the education system.  I will ask my teacher for more resources and demand them because it is my future.  Teachers have their future because they have obtained their leaving certificate and degree.  I do not have such qualifications thus far, however, and I will demand whatever I need to get to where these people have been.<\/p><p> Parents need to encourage and push their children to obtain a leaving certificate.  Some parents may find it hard to push their children.  I need school principals and the Department of Education and Skills to take active steps with Traveller parents to increase participation in second level and third level education.  I welcome any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ian, you are a remarkable young man and I have no doubt that your parents are incredibly proud of you.

It is not just about developing the examination subjects but rather about developing the kinds of skills to succeed in life.  What was it in Ian's school that gave him the opportunities which it is clear he has taken?  I acknowledge that much of it is probably within his own self and personal determination.

On moving so far, Mr. McDonagh may ask all of a sudden whether he is still part of the Traveller community or still part of the new community in the university he is going to.  Sometimes it can be really difficult to get one's head around that and find where one fits in.  All one can do is try to maintain one's identity and hold it.  We need to get to a point where individuals like Mr. McDonagh are not the exception but the rule.  Sometimes when someone from a minority group is so successful, an establishment will laud him or her and ask why everyone cannot do the same.  It sometimes happened me because I left school so young and had children so young.  My advice to Mr. McDonagh, a young man who seems extremely intelligent and confident, is to demand that establishments do not do that.  By doing so, they place full responsibility on the individual to overcome his or her own poverty and barriers.  The issue is regarded as associated with an individual rather than one that might affect a community.  My advice to Mr. McDonagh, in all his successes and when he becomes an amazing garda, is that he should remind people that this matter will not be addressed until he is not regarded as an exception and until he is not a story, when Travellers have achieved true equality and when he can sit at a staff meeting in a Garda station and see himself reflected in the people who work around him.  I offer this advice because it is based on something that I, being who I feel I am and being where I am from, had to struggle with when entering politics.  I hope he can take this small piece of advice with him on his journey, which sounds like it will be tremendous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#HH00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Mr. McDonagh heard us talking about role models and how important they are.

I fell in love with the uniform.  That is what I always wanted.  When I was younger, I did not realise one had to work to get the uniform.  I just believed one put it on and had the job.  It is not until one enters the education system that one realises it is tough to get the uniform.  My parents may not have worked in the education system but they have been role models for us.  They have helped us and got us up every morning.  They brought us to school and showed us the values they never benefitted from.  This is what kept me in the system.<\/p> <p>  To help young Travellers stay in school, resources are required.  Some Traveller children may feel lost because they are ashamed to open up in the classroom and say they do not understand something.  Addressing this does not have to involve a front-line initiative or rubbing it into everyone's face.  If a Traveller child has somewhere to walk into, such as a homework club, it is beneficial.  I can bring any question or part of my homework to my homework club teacher and say I need help with it because I could not understand it in class.  This is what has kept me in school.  The teacher has shown me the value of not sitting at home and that one can change the world if one uses one's voice.<\/p> <p>  In colleges, there is a Traveller participation rate of 1%.  This is because Travellers are not given a hand to get to the colleges.  We need the resources.  It is rare to see Traveller girls stay in the education system but it is great to see when they do.  They also have a role at home and do not want to kill their culture at home.  They have to go home and look after their siblings but the education system does not recognise this.  It operates on the basis of giving out homework that is to be done the next day.  That may be fair in some homes but, in others, the girls and the lads, like me, need to help out.  We also need to prioritise our homes and get them up to a high standard.  Our lives cannot just revolve around saying we need to go up to the room, lock ourselves in and get the homework done.  We need to help our parents because they are the ones that put us on our path.  We need to give something back to our parents.  The only way of doing this is to get the resources from the Department.<\/p> <p>  On keeping Travellers in school, I find it hard myself.  Some individuals ask me why I am still in school.  The answer is that I want to be.  Traveller children need to be tough and stand up to peers who have left school and tell them that was their choice.  They need to say their own choice is to stay in school or, in my case, to go on and be a garda.  I know many individuals who say I will never become a garda.  I will fight to do so.  I will have until I am 35 to enter the Garda.  If I do not get in, having applied year in, year out, I can ask why.  There has to be a reason if I keep applying and do not get in.  Traveller children usually put in the effort first but when they get knocked, there is no one to lift them back up.  If the resources are in the school, a teacher can always walk over and offer help.  If I fall, I have my homework club teacher to pick me back up.  It is great.  My parents do not have the education to help me when I come home but I have the homework club.  If there were more homework clubs, Traveller support groups, etc., we would see an increase in participation.  Traveller children want to move through the system but they do not want to change their culture; they want to staying living as Travellers but need to see the value of education.<\/p> <p>  Travellers may stay in school but when they look for jobs, employers might ask whether they should be given one because they are Travellers.  I have worked in hotels and now work in a nursing home doing activities.  I walked in and said I am a Traveller.  I never hid it in the interview.  It was up to the employer to give me the job.  My cousin is a senior carer in the home.  She walked out of school at 15 and later participated in Youthreach.  She had children and then became a senior carer.  In September, she is going back to education to do nursing.  Changes can be made but the resources have to be put in place.  It is great to have the yellow flag programme in schools but we need the resources in the classrooms to keep the children there.  We have the resources.  I got resources.  Throughout my schooling, I had resources.  When starting the leaving certificate, all the resources got taken away because I needed certain subjects.  There was no time to provide the resources given my timetable but I can always walk up to my year head and say I do not want to do PE on a certain day and want instead to do additional biology, for example.<\/p><p>The teachers will help me because they know I have the potential to go on and they want to see this happen.  It is fair and well to blame the teachers and say they do not want to teach Traveller children, but children have to fulfil their roles too.  It is a 50-50 road here.  Children and teachers need to push together if any goals are to be met.  In life, there are two sides to every story and agreement must be reached.  In this case, resources need to be invested to keep these Traveller children in school.<\/p><p> My role models are my parents and the community garda&iacute; who I see walking around every day.  I used to ask them how they got into the Garda - about the requirements, etc. - which may have been the wrong question.  By the time I was 11 years of age, I knew all the requirements for getting into the Garda.  Every time I watch garda&iacute; passing out, I wonder whether any of them are Travellers.  I want to get there.  I would not take any other job.  I do not want any other job.  I want to join the Garda.  I want to make a change.  As we can see, sometimes there is discrimination in the Garda.  Some garda&iacute; may discriminate and others may not.<\/p><p> I want to join the Garda to show that there can be a member of the force from the Traveller community.  That would enable me to build links with Traveller children and other disadvantaged children and see whether I can make changes in their lives and inspire them to keep going to school and keep working.  I think education is the weapon of life.  If one does not have education, one will find life tough.  My parents got through life.  In the 21st century, we cannot sit back and say we do not need education.  We need education for everything we need and for anything we want.  The Government needs to get resources in place for Traveller children and indeed for all children.  There is no point saying we will give everything to Traveller children while isolating other children.  We need to get these resources for all children.<\/p><p> We do not know what is happening behind closed doors.  It is great for us to go to school every day with a clean uniform and a happy face, but what is inside us?  We can all show off these happy faces, but what is inside us?  These children may want to do well, but they may have to walk out of school for other reasons.  If the resources were there, every Traveller child and every other child would do well.  The main thing is to provide the services, get children into school and keep them in school for as long as possible.  No pressure should be put on children because suicide may arise and stuff like that.  The main thing is to educate children.  When they are educated, it will be up to themselves to make their own opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Good stuff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019032600002#KK00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I would like to ask Mr. McDonagh about the homework club he mentioned.

I welcome the opportunity to meet today for our regular engagement.  I am joined by Ms Derville Rowland, director general for financial conduct, and Mr. Ed Sibley, deputy governor for prudential regulation.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a brief overview of the macroeconomic outlook and address Brexit later.  In terms of the baseline forecast, we are projecting that underlying domestic demand, the best measure of what is going on in the economy, will expand by 4.3% this year and 3.9% next year.  In line with that, we are projecting unemployment to average 4.9% in 2019 and 4.7% percent in 2020.  As a consequence, we expect compensation per employee or wages to increase by 3.4% this year and by 3.6% next year.  In cumulative terms this is an increase of approximately 7% in the next two years, which is significant given that inflation is quite low.  Given the recent downgrades in European and global economic forecasts and the bias to the downside in the risk assessment, we will continue to monitor the possible implications for these forecasts should there be any further decline in the external environment.<\/p> <p>  The work of the Central Bank of Ireland is guided by its mission, which is to serve the public interest by safeguarding monetary and financial stability and working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.  Our policy priorities are set out in our recent strategic plan for the period from 2019 to 2021.  It highlights strengthening consumer protection, resilience and Brexit.  I will address the issues listed in the committee's invitation letter in the context of these three strategic priorities. <\/p> <p>  Strengthening consumer protection is a high priority for the Central Bank in the context of an overall strategy to enhance confidence and trust in the financial system through high quality regulation, purposeful engagement, effective gatekeeping, assertive supervision and robust enforcement.  Consumer protection is embedded through all of those dimensions of the Central Bank's work.  For example, the Central Bank's macroprudential mortgage measures are intended to both enhance the resilience of the financial system and protect household borrowers from excessive debt.  Our work on mortgage arrears has also involved considerable collaboration and co-ordination across all parts of the bank, given the importance of making sure the resilience and consumer protection angles are factored into the bank's work on non-performing loans.<\/p> <p>  If we think about the role of interactive prudential supervision and consumer protection, it is essential that individual firms are resilient if consumers are to trust that deposits are safe, investments are protected and insurance policies will pay out when a claim is due.  In addition, our prudential and conduct supervisors have a shared interest in the sustainability of business models, arrangements for governance, risk management and control, and the culture of regulated firms.<\/p><p>When we think about our new strategic plan in terms of building on what is already there, which is quite extensive in terms of the framework, the next step forward is a focus on the conduct of firms.  This is essential given the wide range of misconduct scandals we have seen around the world, including at home the tracker mortgage scandal.  It is also reflected in terms of strategy in our supervisory approach, which is increasingly focused on conduct and cultural issues.<\/p><p> I shall update the committee on the tracker mortgage examination, which is now in its final stages.  At the end of last month nearly 40,000 customers have been identified as suffering unacceptable harm from these failures. The overall number is the same as at the end of December.  There has been in increase in the total payout, which has increased now to &euro;665 million.  By the end of March we expect the accounts remaining to be paid to be about 300.  In turn, of those 300 accounts most will be paid in April so we really are towards the end stage.  Some of the remaining numbers are cases while exists but it is proving difficult to contact individuals but of course that money will remain for them once contacted.<\/p><p> I will update the committee on the tracker mortgage examination, which is now in the final stages.  At the end of last month, nearly 40,000 customers had been identified as suffering unacceptable harm from these failures.  The overall number is the same as at the end of December.  The total payout has increased to &euro;665 million.  By the end of March, we expect the number of accounts remaining to be paid to be about 300, of which most will be paid in April.  We are, therefore, moving towards the end stage.  Some of the remaining number are cases where there is a file but it is proving difficult to contact individuals.  This money will remain for these individuals once they have been contacted.<\/p><p> As the Central Bank supervised the tracker mortgage examination, the focus at all times has been to make sure that all groups of customers who have been affected have been identified and received remediation.  As indicated, this is now largely completed.  The remaining work is to make sure that any final issues affecting groups of customers are worked through and all eligible groups are included.  We expect this process to conclude in the coming weeks and we will issue a final report thereafter.  When we say this examination is coming to a conclusion that is in the sense of a particular project.  Any further individuals or groups that emerge, for whatever reason, will receive the same treatment under our business as usual supervision. <\/p><p> It is important to emphasise that in parallel to the supervision, the enforcement work on this scandal is ongoing.  These are detailed and forensic investigations involving the scrutiny of thousands of documents and the conduct of interviews to establish the exact circumstances of the matters under investigation, including the actions of individuals and entities.<\/p><p> If we look to the future, our culture report from last year emphasises that the framework would be further improved by having an individual accountability framework.  This would ensure clearer lines of individual accountability within firms, as well as providing for an enhanced fitness and probity regime and a unified enforcement process.  My understanding is that we will address that issue in a separate hearing in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> On personal contract plans, PCPs, we have been working on this issue from different angles for a while.  The data to the end of June 2018 show there are around 70,000 outstanding contracts, which amounts to about &euro;1.2 billion in value.  It is important to note that from the end of June 2019, the Central Bank's new central credit register will collect information on PCPs from all lenders that provide these loans.  Our understanding of these contracts will be further enhanced when those data come online.<\/p><p> We are also working to strengthen consumer protection in relation to licensed moneylending.  Last year, we published a consultation paper which proposed adding certain extra measures to the code.  The plan is that these new regulations will be introduced in the second half of this year.  In finalising these additional measures, we fully recognise the vulnerability and particular circumstances of the households that typically engage with licensed moneylenders and the high cost of the loans they provide.<\/p><p> I will now address the resilience topic under which we will address the issues of capital requirements, interest rates and non-performing loans.  The fundamentals of a national central bank is to make sure the financial system is resilient in order that it can withstand shocks in the future and protect the wider economy from financial instability.<\/p><p>I will deal with the issue of capital requirements.  It is important to note, especially in light of the risks we face now, that the capital position of banks has improved by a factor of three since 2007 when measured compared with risk-weighted assets.<\/p><p> Another vulnerability is funding risk.  In contrast to what was happening in the boom, the reliance on short-term wholesale funding has declined significantly.  The primary funding base is now domestic consumer deposits.  It is interesting to note that in spite of recent market volatility, the funding costs facing the banks remain contained.<\/p><p> As indicated, the strategy to improve resilience include our macroprudential measures.  An important element of that is the mortgage rules, which have the dual role of both protecting households and banks from excessive debt and avoiding the risk of a spiral occurring between credit dynamics and house prices.  In addition, we made a decision last year to activate a 1% counter-cyclical capital buffer, which will come into force in July 2019.  Importantly, this is intended in good times to build up the capital levels in the bank but in turn it will mean that banks will be less likely to engage in a credit squeeze in the next downturn.  We have an extra measure called the other systemically important institutions, OSII, buffer, which basically protects against a risk of an individual bank causing problems to the system for a variety of reasons. <\/p><p> On prevailing mortgage rates, our analysis indicated that some of the factors that need to be taken into account are historical default rates, the level of non-performing loans in portfolios and the fact that, in contrast to other jurisdictions, the typical mortgage in Ireland has a high loan-to-value ratio, which means its risk profile is higher than the risk profile of loans where more of the house purchase is funded by a down payment.  The Irish market is small scale and fixed cost elements in banking, for example, the cost of information systems are increasing in relative importance.  We also see lower levels of mortgage switching in Ireland compared with many other European markets and there is no doubt that the limited number of banks of itself leads to concentration and less competitive pressures on pricing.<\/p><p> As members know, the Central Bank has been emphatic in identifying the importance of reducing non-performing loans in the banking system since non-performing loans at excessive levels compromise the capacity of both the banks and the debtors to weather future downturns.  There has been considerable progress in this respect.  The stock of non-performing loans had declined by 79% since the peak in 2013.  There are many ways to reduce non-performing loans.  These include re-engaging with the debtor; restructuring the mortgage; writedowns; engaging through the insolvency service; loan sales; loan securitisations; and seeking finality through the courts.<\/p><p> In the years since the crisis, the primary way that non-performing mortgages have been addressed has been through restructuring.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, has played a critical role in ensuring that borrowers are protected.  Within the CCMA, the mortgage arrears resolution process requires that repossession is only used as a last resort.  We have seen an ongoing decline in the number of long-term arrears cases in the past five years.  As I indicated, there has been much restructuring.  The number of accounts that were restructured at the end of last year was more than 111,000.  These restructuring arrangements seem to be working, with 87% meeting the terms of their current arrangement.<\/p><p> Having said that, there are many other options in terms of addressing non-performing loans.  It remains the case that in order for a secured market to work, repossession, as a last resort, must be an option.  While we have extensive protections in place for distressed borrowers, the loss of ownership risk remains.  It is important to remember that, in an international context, the scale of repossessions in Ireland has been low.  If we take the most recent year, 2018, some 877 primary homes were repossessed.  One third of those repossessions were the result of court actions and the remainder were through the sale or surrender of properties.  We share the societal concern that these borrowers who are at risk of losing their homes are extremely vulnerable.  Our focus, in our supervisory work, is to ensure that all lenders, whether banks or non-banks, adhere to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  We continue to urge all borrowers and lenders to engage and seek solutions that minimise the loss of ownership.<\/p><p> Having emphasised that restructuring has been the single most frequent approach to reducing non-performing loans, it is clear that we are also seeing sales of loan portfolios to non-bank investment funds.  This does have a valid role to play.  I have stated previously that the transfer of these loan portfolios to non-banks, which are mostly owned by foreign investors, constitutes a reduction in national risk.  In the event of a future downturn, the burden of those potential losses will be shared overseas.  We also, with the support of the legislation, have made sure that statutory consumer safeguards are the same regardless of whether a loan was held by a bank or a non-bank.<\/p><p> Given our twin focus on resilience and consumer protection, this framework or approach explains why we have grave concerns about the No Consent, No Sale Bill.  Given that the consumer protection framework, from a regulatory perspective, is the same whether a loan is held by a bank or a non-bank, we do not see that the Bill would add any extra regulatory protection for consumers.  At the same time, the Bill would damage resilience since the transferability of loans is a central feature in a modern financial system.  In addition to restricting the ability to sell loans, please recall that the transferability of loans is also important for securitisation and collateral provision to obtain liquidity from the inter-bank market or the euro system, from us or from the ECB.<\/p><p> While these restrictions are costly even under normal conditions such as those which obtain today - and because of those extra costs they would have the effect of raising interest rates - their impact is especially destabilising in a crisis environment since the ability to restructure balance sheets and obtain liquidity is essential to resilience under crisis conditions.  While we recognise that the Bill makes an exception for firms that are failing or likely to fail, this designation is only made once a crisis is well advanced, whereas financial stability is best maintained by ensuring that resilience enhancing measures can be taken in a timely manner with the strengthening of balance sheets during good times, thus allowing the economy and the financial system to better withstand adverse economic and financial conditions.<\/p><p> Let me turn to resilience in the credit union sector.  The Central Bank has an important role to play in making sure that the credit union movement in Ireland thrives.  Our vision in this regard is \"Strong Credit Unions in Safe Hands\" and it underpins our mandate to make sure that each credit union protects the funds of its members, that financial stability is maintained and that the credit union movement is in a state of well-being.  When we look at the conditions in the sector, as we reported in December, we see strong reserves, sustained expansion in lending and a continued reduction in arrears.  However, there is no doubt that challenges remain for the sector even though there is dispersion across individual unions.  There is an average loan-to-asset ratio of only 28%, a high-cost income ratio of 74% and a low return on assets of just 1%.<\/p><p>It is not the regulatory framework that is leading to this dispersion.  The framework does not inhibit future business model development.  Overcoming these structural challenges will involve credit unions enhancing their competence and capability, addressing operational effectiveness and expanding revenue through loan growth and non-interest income.<\/p><p> We view the regulatory framework as being tailored to and proportionate for credit unions.  Given that the average loan-to-asset ratio ranges from 11% to 73% under the framework, it is clear that some credit unions are faring better than others in meeting the lending needs of their members.  Under the consultation paper Potential Changes to the Lending Framework, CP125, we are looking at additional lending capacity, which, on a prudent basis, would facilitate more long-term lending as long as duration and concentration risks are managed.  We think the flexibility is there for credit unions to improve their future business models.<\/p><p> As everyone here understands, any form of Brexit - but particularly a hard, no-deal version - will be damaging to Ireland.  Recognising this, the Central Bank has been focused on Brexit risks since before the 2016 UK referendum.  We continue to analyse and work to mitigate the risks posed to the economy, consumers, the financial system, and the regulatory environment.  In the context of the risks to the wider economy, although we have put out macro numbers, we also recognise that the effects will be uneven with sectors such as agrifood being particularly exposed to the loss of export markets and disruption of supply chains.  The immediate priority is to mitigate so-called cliff-edge risks of a no-deal Brexit.  More broadly, it is important that the financial system is sufficiently resilient to withstand any effects arising from Brexit.  It is important that the financial risks to consumers are mitigated and that with regard to authorising firms arriving here, we adopt a proportionate, robust, efficient and effective approach in line with European regulatory norms.<\/p><p> In light of this, Brexit obviously continues to be a high priority for us.  In conjunction with the wider European regulatory community and the Houses of the Oireachtas in getting the Brexit legislation passed, we think that the avoidable risks of Brexit have been mitigated against.  However, there is no doubt that a no-deal Brexit will still constitute a severe economic and financial blow.  Given that all of our work and strategies have aimed to ensure that the banking system has high levels of capital and good liquidity provision, its ability to withstand a no-deal Brexit is much better today than would have been the case had this happened a few years ago.

As the Deputy is aware, we have a large multinational sector, which, essentially, has access to a global market.  As a result, the firms involved in that sector will not be particularly exposed to the risks of Brexit.<\/p><p>As the Deputy indicated, for so many small firms their only export market is the UK, and within certain segments of agrifood, the dominant export market is the UK.  There is no doubt that these risks are quite concentrated, and given, in turn, that those industries are also regionally concentrated, there will be different effects across the country.<\/p><p> The results the ESRI and the Department of Finance delivered are in the ballpark that we also see.  There is a fairly strong consensus among the economics profession on what might prevail.<\/p><p> We must also be alert to how this unfolds.  One can imagine, if there is no deal, that in the initial days and weeks there will be much disruption and the question is how quickly some of that disruption will be managed through adaptation.  There will be a big market response because everyone who looks at the market sees that it is expecting a deal to pass or it is optimistic about what no deal would mean.  We would have to be very alert to those short-term effects while recognising that Brexit is essentially a permanent disruption in terms of the challenges facing industries, individual firms and regions.  In other words, the Government will have to think about all those factors, including how these regions will adapt to this situation.<\/p><p> We are all waiting to see what happens in Westminster, but it is important at this point to make some points.  One is about those economic consequences being severe.  However, I would say that because this is something for which we in the financial system have had to make preparations for all eventualities, it is not the case that the financial system will add to those troubles.  The financial system will face challenges but because of the legislation that has been put in place, because we have insisted that firms are ready for a no-deal Brexit and because of the comparatively strong balance sheets of firms, it is not the case that one would have the add-on effect of the bad economic news being augmented by risks of instability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Is it important to emphasise that there is no cost-free Brexit?

I think we have had this conversation many times but like it or not, we had a big crisis here.<\/p><p>Like it or not, there have been many non-performing mortgage loans.  It is important to have a globally consistent approach to regulation in order that they are not undercut by different jurisdictions having different views on this.  It can be argued that it is a little bureaucratic and so on, but below that is the basic reality of the Irish economy that any regulator will ask questions as to how much it is prudentially sound to lend into Ireland.  This is why there is a capital allocation against mortgages.  Non-banks do not have this kind of regulatory oversight because they do not take consumer deposits.  As a result, the kinds of concerns regulators have are different.  As non-banks, they must raise money in the wholesale markets and then the bond investors and so on will also make calls about their prudential judgment.  We do not see non-banks coming in with super low mortgage pricing.<\/p><p> This is not the place to look to find what would be the key to unlocking the competition in the banking system.

We need to differentiate a little between, say, a large, internationally active firm that was used to operating its own internal models deciding to start offering to operate in Ireland, and a start-up entity which may not have that sophistication and experience.  Yes, on an initial lending into Ireland, one would expect that an entity would have to apply standardised weighting in either circumstance, but I do not think that is necessarily unreflective of the risks in the Irish mortgage market today.  An entity would have a period during which it would need to build up the data to show it was capable of tailoring its own models, its own existing systems, to enable them to come up with an accurate and appropriate risk-weighting based on the lending it was doing.  That would be the case with an existing firm coming in.

In that context, cashbacks can play a role.  I recognise the Deputy's observation that, while they can be cheaper for customers in the first number of years and, if customers have the wisdom to switch products later, they can turn out to be the cheapest option of all, they can turn out to be more expensive if customers stay on that option in the longer run.  In a transparent market where people have the option to switch, though, there is a role to play for cashbacks that are properly sold.  Last year, we undertook regulatory work on the advertisements of cashbacks because we saw that they had to be tightened up.  We carried out some consultation work - the Deputy will be aware of the transparency around the various mortgage options - and strengthened the framework for the disclosure of cashbacks.  We have also changed the framework for telling people on an annual basis about cheaper options that are available to them from each lender.  We believe this will result in better options for people and in them saving money.  Many customers could save on their mortgage products if they shop around and switch.  We encourage everyone to take that course of action.<\/p><p> My final observation on this matter is that this is different from other kinds of intervention.  There would be no role for the Central Bank to intervene in cashbacks unless we saw them being missold.  We do not see that in the market.  We recognise that there can be better value for people if they shop around, but that could be said across the suite of mortgages.  There is considerable value for people who go to the trouble of switching.

There are still elements of dysfunction, but we are moving towards a mortgage market that is more risk based and risk sensitive.  There is greater differentiation and we are seeing consumers taking advantage of that.  The lowest rate on offer today is 2.3% for a two-year fixed mortgage and there is a variable rate of 2.75%.

My second point, which is very important, is that the voluntary code makes exceptions for conditions of financial distress.  I recognise there is a financial distress exception in the Bill being put forward, but I made the point in my opening remarks regarding that being too narrowly defined.  It is defined in terms of \"failing or likely to fail\".  That is an end game type of issue.<\/p> <p>  Our point is that it is important to anticipate and pre-empt financial distress and that occurs throughout our whole approach to this issue.  Where it makes sense is where that includes loan sales which reduce the national risk facing us in the next downturn.  There is a basic similarity for the reason Deputy Doherty gave.  The issue of compulsion versus voluntary, and the scope of financial distress, however, means we think the Bill would have those adverse consequences.  I will also make the point that the role of transferable loans in the financial system has become much more important compared to 30 years ago.  <\/p> <p>  The likelihood of a bank at that time needing to raise liquidity from a central bank on a collateralised basis was much less than we would appreciate now.  The importance of securitisation as a technique is much more prevalent now.  I also refer to the role of collateral in the interbank market.  The world has changed.  Even in respect of the code itself, there is a difference between voluntary and statutory.  There is also the issue regarding the conditions of financial distress.  It is interesting to consider the history of this issue as well.

This issue arose in the aftermath of the Central Bank becoming responsible in 1989 for supervising building societies.  It might be recalled that if a person had a mortgage with a building society, then he or she got rights to vote.  That could be relevant.  There was much talk in subsequent years of conversion rights which might lead to windfall profits.  It did not transpire that way.  That was, however, before the securitisation of mortgages took off in the market.  There was a concern at that time, because we were in an immature state of evolution, that voting rights would be lost if a mortgage was securitised.  Those voting rights were seen as being valuable in respect of a decision to convert from a building society to a public limited company and any profits that might ensue to the holder of the voting rights.<\/p> <p>  It was entirely in that context that the voluntary code of practice was put in place.  It was with an eye to that.  Since then, things have changed dramatically and we would never now issue anything on a voluntary basis.  That is not that way the regulatory approach works.  We do things on a very solid footing, as can be seen in respect of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  This proposal confers no actual benefit on consumers.  All the rights and protections they have now apply equally whether a loan is owned by a bank or a non-bank. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Ms Rowland outlined the origins but the code still exists.

We know how parliamentary questions work: they go to the Minister, the Secretary General and the Governor of the Central Bank.  I presume that when the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, answered the parliamentary question tabled by the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and indicated that, notwithstanding its voluntary nature, he expected all State banks to implement the code in full, this was flagged to the Central Bank and the Minister's response was known to it at that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#P00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":352,"content":"<p>That was before my time.

Even within the code there was an exception clause dealing with financial distress.

The Department of Finance has indicated that the regulation of vulture funds will increase interest rates for consumers.  That Bill was signed into law six months ago and it has not had that effect.  I take some of what is being stated with a pinch of salt.  However, there are other matters we must discuss in the context of pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  Much focus has been put on securitisation.  It is not the intention of the Bill to prevent that type of passive securitisation.  Section 3 may need to be clarified further but vehicles would be set up within the banking group, such as AIB's system, for securitisation.  It is not the intention to prevent that.  I make no bones about it that this is about giving power to the borrower to prevent the sale to a vulture fund if he or she thinks it is the right course of action.  Professor Lane has made the point on a number of occasions that there is no difference between a bank and a vulture fund.<\/p><p>If that is the case, then the borrowers will have no problem giving their consent.  The reality, however, is that there is a big difference.  Many of these vulture funds do not offer the types of solutions and restructuring arrangements that the banks have offered.  We know they have short-term interests, whereas banks have long-term interests.  It is always better for those who want to keep a roof over their heads, and who are making a genuine attempt to do that, to be with a bank than with a vulture fund.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#P00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I appreciate we have this difference of views.

It is a significant appointment not just for him personally, but for Ireland.  We are in the tenth year since the banking collapse.  Professor Lane will agree that ordinary people in Ireland made many sacrifices to bail out the banks.  Many people lost their jobs and many took wage reductions and tax increases.  There is, however, close to full employment in the economy now, as is reflected in the Central Bank's report.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that the banks are, in many ways, back to their old tricks.  The atmosphere today is very similar to that of the years before the financial collapse.  Mr. Draghi takes the view, one that Professor Lane may share, that a moral hazard arises when people fail to pay their mortgage debts.  We all understand the concept behind that.  What I do not understand, however, and I would like Professor Lane to comment on this, is why the lobbying for the return of very high salaries and improved salaries in the banks which were bailed out has continued apace.  There is also lobbying for the return of bonuses.  I know some of this is a decision for the Minister for Finance, but does Professor Lane believe the cap on pay for bankers and chief executives which is in force in the bailed out banks should be relaxed?  In recent weeks, there has been renewed lobbying by a number of banks to raise that pay cap and to return to a culture of extraordinarily high pay for bankers.  Moral hazard seems to exist only for little people who have a single residential mortgage on their homes, whereas the banks seem to be back to their old tricks.  Will Professor Lane comment on that?  Would it be wise for us as a country to allow bankers to be paid annual salaries of more than &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000?  Would the Central Bank resist that?  As he departs, does Professor Lane have any advice as regards what would be best for Ireland to do?<\/p><p>Alongside that there has been a return to a massive escalation in land prices, particularly in all the major cities and towns.  It went absolutely off the Richter scale in the two or three years before the collapse.  That is the second reason I am concerned that we have not fully learned the lessons of the past.  I would like to hear Professor Lane's response to that as Governor of the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#S00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I would like to make a general observation on whether this time is different.  I will say a little about whether we are going back to the situation we had in the mid-2000s before I bring in Mr. Sibley, who leads our prudential supervision, on the specific issue of bank bonuses and bank pay levels.  It is important to say that the economy is intrinsically volatile.  In the mid-2000s, there was excessive optimism that Ireland would never face a recession, that prices were only going one way and that we were unique in some sense.  Then we had a horrible, very severe and protracted crash.  As the Deputy has indicated, it caused a great deal of pain for people who lost their jobs.  Those who were unlucky enough to be of the age to take out mortgages in the mid-2000s had to contend with all of this pain.  As a result of this country's high debt, everyone is now paying higher rates of tax.  Those taxes are not being used to fund hospitals and all of that.  They are partly being used to fund the costs associated with the bailout.  There is no doubt that much of the work we do is aimed at avoiding a return to that situation.  I am pretty sure that is the reason we work in the Central Bank.  Much of what we are doing seeks to make sure the banks have enough capital, which basically means they are not leveraging themselves too much.  We are avoiding that.  With the mortgage rules, we are trying to avoid the desperation that is caused when credit pushes prices higher and people think they have to get in to avoid taking on too much debt.  We are working hard to avoid a spiral between credit and house prices.<\/p> <p>  We have also seen a change in the nature of the financial system.  As the Deputy knows, because the banks are more severely regulated and have had to deal with so many legacy issues, a great deal of land and many office blocks and rental apartment buildings are being bought by non-banks.  Global firms are searching the world for good investment opportunities.  Prices here will be driven higher because of that global capital.  My point is that this is not just about the domestic banks which caused the problem the last time.  Now the financial system has non-banks.  The system we regulate here has a lot of internationally focused operations where pay levels are high.  Then we have our approach to the domestic banks.  As the Deputy has indicated, pay levels constitute a particular issue for the State-owned or State-backed domestic banks.  Mr. Sibley will speak about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Before I speak about pay, I would like to add a little colour to the Governor's remarks.  Like many people within the banks, I am personally driven by ensuring that there is no recurrence of the pain and human costs associated with what happened here before.  The environment we are now operating in is fundamentally different, certainly from a regulatory and supervisory perspective.  The international and domestic regulatory framework is fundamentally changed.  The philosophy underpinning our approach to supervision has fundamentally changed.  There has been a fundamental shift in the requirements around the levels of capital the banks have to hold, how the banks must fund themselves and how we can move towards being able to resolve difficulties without recourse to the taxpayer.  Our expectations around governance, risk management and control have all changed.  A great deal of work has been done internationally and domestically to address the failings that led up to the crisis.<\/p><p> Specifically on the point of pay, which was raised by the Chairman on the previous occasion when he was not entirely happy with our somewhat nuanced response, I do not see a case for raising the cap in the domestic retail banks.  That is a matter for their shareholders.  Clearly, different candidates will be available to operate in those roles at a higher salary level but it is perfectly plausible to find people to work in those roles within the salary cap.  Where there is a case for thinking carefully is regarding what is happening underneath those levels and the level of remuneration for some of the critical functions in roles subject to the cap where the banks are competing against firms not subject to it.  They are potentially at risk of losing critical staff in risk management, analysts and those who deal with customers.  There is merit in looking at elements of variable pay in these circumstances, subject to it being well designed, making sure the incentives are aligned with the culture stated within the institution and being consistent with the rules now in place on having clawbacks where people are overly short term in their thinking and risks are not being managed.  There is a case for thinking in these terms.  It would also allow firms and banks to vary their costs according to their circumstances.  If they head into a downturn with a high fixed salary cost, the options available to cut back costs are different to those with a more variable element.  There is a case for looking at variable pay but not at the top level.  It is much more with regard to the people working in the institutions.  It would have to be well designed, consistent with the rules and all we are doing on the culture in institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>When Mr. Sibley says \"variable pay\", does he mean bonuses or bonus-type pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#U00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>In other words, it is performance, results-based pay.

Something plaguing Europe's democratic institutions, which is, ultimately, a risk for the Central Bank and the European Central Bank system, is populism, which is partly driven by insecurity, precarious employment and the fact that some people are doing awfully well in a global financial system, just as Mr. Sibley has described, while others are not.  They do not see an argument as to why people such as bankers should earn extraordinary amounts and why there should be a return to the bonus-type culture that was distorting, particularly in cases such as Lehman Brothers.  We are all familiar with it from television and films.  I will direct this question to the incoming chief economist.  Is there a case for ordinary workers in the public and private sectors receiving pay increases in a structured and orderly way while being cautious about people at the highest echelons going back to the culture that, in many ways, drove the bank crash?  Effectively, bankers were masters of the universe.  That was their title.  We all know there were Lehman brothers but there were no Lehman sisters.  Thankfully, there are many more sisters in banking now.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether the Central Bank follows the price of development land in Dublin or the deals that are being done at present.

Apart from the wider issues referred to by the Deputy, there is a clear feedback to financial stability and we need to pay attention to issues where there are consequential developments such as Brexit and the issues that lie behind that.  It is also important to go through the individual issues and determine which are relevant to the issue in question.  Issues such as the future of work and who will win and lose from automation or from globalisation are very important, even from a macroeconomic point of view.  The consumption profiles of those on middle and lower wages are very different from the profiles of the top 1% and this shift in income is a big part of what is going on in the world economy and has consequences for the levels of demand in the world.<\/p> <p>  On the land issue, it is important to ask who is taking the risk of speculating on high land prices.  In the mid-2000s the risk was, unfortunately, taken by the taxpayer when the Government stepped in after banks had made excessively risky loans, which had been funded by our deposits and bonds.  It is quite different when it is a global investment fund.  The risk profile of what we are seeing now is very different from then.  In a world of super-low interest rates, buying a property with a rental yield looks more attractive than holding a bond or a bank deposit.  This is basic economics but it is very important that we prevent the banking system from taking excessive commercial real estate risk and this is also the case across Europe.  We are putting a lot of emphasis on making sure the risks in commercial real estate are not concentrated in banks.<\/p> <p>  There was a political source of the cap on pay and the question is how we explain lifting that cap in the context of inequality and the beliefs of typical people.

House prices are one issue but the supply of housing is a different issue, as is the mix of housing that is built.  We have to ask if the mix of starter homes outside Dublin is where it should be, compared to the mix in Dublin, and there are issues around apartments versus trophy homes.

Banks sell loans to companies such as Cerberus and other financial operators that do not function here on a day-to-day basis.

In that sense, the original bank obviously holds the deeds to the property.  I ask the Governor to explain that process.

Loan ownership might rest with an entity but the framework that was put in place was such that credit-servicing firms would deal with consumers because we were at pains to ensure that consumers would always and only interact, in terms of arrears or any other loan issues, with a regulated entity.  The Senator might recall a lot of discussion here and elsewhere about the underlying loan owner not actually being subject to regulation.  As a result of those discussions, new legislation to provide that the underlying loan owners be subject to regulation was passed recently.  That is in transition now so, in the future, all loan owners will be subject to regulation.  As it stands, the system in place now is that a consumer deals with a regulated entity.  Indeed, the law provides that he or she must do so.  In that way, all the protections of the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears must be complied with and the Central Bank can supervise to make sure it is done properly and that they meet their obligations to the entity.  However, once a matter goes to court, it may very well be the case that the owner of legal title would have to be dealt with in the legal proceedings and the loan ownership had previously been resting with the unregulated party or entity so the transfer of title could be at issue.  In the new system, as I am sure members are aware, the underlying loan owner will have to be regulated.  We are in a transition period right now and loan owners must make an application by 21 April to do so, at which point, that will no longer be the case.  It might be something to do with the legal system requiring the title in possession proceedings to be dealt with by the owner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#BB00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>The original bank that extended the loan is holding the deeds.

This means that the credibility and decision-making of the appeals are at arm's length from the lenders and the Central Bank and are led by independent people, particularly consumer advocates, who are in the majority.

One would have to read the wording of the terms and conditions as a whole and in particular.  One would come up with a different answer depending on the different words of a contract.  In the particular case we are speaking about, there were a number of key clauses that had to be read in totality.<\/p><p>One was a phrase in the contract called \"the then prevailing rate\".  The question arises as to what does \"then\" mean and to what time does it relate?  The view AIB took was that it related to the timing that the customer rolled off a contract and that it would offer the rate prevailing at that point, not the prevailing rates at the inception of the contract.  One must look at these things in their totality.  The Central Bank's approach had to be whether it could reasonably challenge the approach that AIB was taking in all the circumstances, taking all the contract terms into account and looking at the rate and the actions.  The Central Bank took it as far as we felt we could.  Of course, there could be particular things that each individual might be able to say - that we would not know about things that were done or said to them - and it was very important to offer customers the opportunity to avail of the options available to them inside the tracker mortgage examination, for example, the appeal and any other options.  We were as robust as we could be in that particular case.  Our track record demonstrates our robustness given the numbers of customers who have been included in tracker mortgage examination.  When we look at an issue, we do not just look at the contract, we look at the transparency requirements, the factors which pertained at the time the customer entered into the contract and what their legitimate expectations would be in terms of all those circumstances.  We also look at what we see as a reasonable approach to that.  We have not been behind the curve in challenging where we feel there is a reasonable interpretation and we are committed to that.  However, I recognise that some customers will be disappointed in the outcome because there are people who would wish to have that cheaper tracker rate and do not have it.  I understand that some might be disappointed.  However, we have taken a robust approach on their behalf and have ensured that where we could challenge, we have done so.

The world economy needs to grow around that rate in order to avoid <i>per capita<\/i>reductions in income.<br\/><br\/>In Europe, there has been a significant reduction in growth this year but the European Central Bank has reasons to believe that the second half of this year will be better.  First, the reduction in growth in 2018 was sufficiently unexpected that inventories built up.  There was over-production which meant inventories built up and manufacturers may have slammed on the breaks a little to run those down.  When inventories return to normal then production resumes.  Second, the price of oil has fallen.  In 2018 it was increasing quite a bit then it started to come down in the last months of the year.  The price of oil is quite important across Europe because energy is such a large part of household and wider expenditure.  It is good news for Europe that the price of oil is coming down.  Third, fiscal policy is loosening.  There are various plans this year for looser fiscal policy.  There are some countries where that has not yet kicked in.  Therefore there are factors which lead us to believe that the second half of the year will look better than what is going on now.  <br\/><br\/>More broadly, globally, I am sure that the Deputy reads the same material as I do -----  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#JJ00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I think Professor Lane reads more of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#JJ01000","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":557,"content":"<p>There are concerns that China's economy is growing more slowly.

Essentially, the last ten years has been recovery from the crisis.  It is easier to grow when there are spare resources which simply need to be brought back into activity.  When unemployment in the USA hits just over 3%, productivity must take the lead.  There is a wide range of views about the scope for that.  <\/p> <p>  Is it the case that there will be a slowdown?

Martin Wolf wrote in <i>The Financial Times<\/i>that a powerful implication is that room for a response to a recession would be limited by historical standards, particularly in monetary policy.  This is quite striking.  If the US Federal Reserve had to make a standard response to a significant recession its short-term rates might need to be -2.5%.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan would have to go further still.  By virtue of the response of the institutions of world capitalism to the most recent recession, another global recession coming would be in the context of having exhausted some of the toolkit for responding to recession, particularly monetarily.

I emphasise that 2008 was extremely atypical because it was so severe.  There was a clear set of imbalances in the run up to it that made the recession especially deep and nasty.  The recessions we speak about now that might happen in the coming years are not of that nature.  The more typical recession in the US, for example, is a contraction of less than 1% of GDP compared to the -5% seen in 2008 and 2009.  We have to be measured about mild recessions.  We do not have the imbalances of that period.  On the other hand, it will be a mix of a number of factors.  Central banks have already done quite a bit in terms of finding unconventional ways to have accommodating monetary conditions.  At every monetary policy meeting of the ECB when we release a statement the final part of that statement indicates the responsibility on fiscal policy.  In 2008 and 2009 there was a global co-ordinated fiscal response.  In a severe recession situation there must be a fiscal response.  This is one reason we and others elsewhere put so much emphasis in non-recessionary times on running fiscal policy prudently.  It gives us the room to be aggressive in a downturn.  We do not advocate surpluses for the sake of it.  We advocate them in the good years to allow significant deficits in the bad years.<\/p> <p>  The Scandinavian countries are interesting in this regard.  They want to protect public services and public spending so, therefore, they run a very prudent fiscal policy.  In the mid-2000s countries such as Finland and Sweden had surpluses of the order of four or five percentage points of GDP.  This meant they could have a big fiscal response in the crisis and avoid the austerity that was so damaging.  These are the connectives.  If we want to turn on fiscal stimulus measures in a recession we have to build them up in the good years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I will move on to the impact of Brexit in the medium to long term way as opposed to the immediate impact, with regard to the nature of the economy and the danger the Irish economy could become even more imbalanced or reliant on finance in the aftermath of Brexit.<\/p><p>Does Professor Lane agree that this is a danger?

The dynamic of what Nick Shaxson called the &quot;finance curse&quot; - which is similar to the &quot;oil curse&quot; - will be to drive deregulation in the sector, which will then flow into the domestic sector as happened in the run-up to 2007-2008.

Finance is one sector but there are other sectors that are very big too.  It is often said that we have an over-reliance on multinationals, whether in financial or non-financial services and, while there are some similarities between them, there are also some differences.  Concerns about crowding out other activities and over-concentration need to be addressed.  We can do this by ensuring that there are supports and training so that other sectors of the economy can operate.  We have a very open economy so many of the jobs in the multinational sector are taken not by domestic people but by immigrants, which reduces the risk of crowding out but adds to congestion in housing, transport and public services.  The Government has to be alive to recognising the implications of rapid expansion in any of these international sectors.<\/p> <p>  The Single Supervisory Mechanism for banks and the fact that financial supervision and rule-making is taking place at European level reduce the risk of being captured.

We have probably not seen the same effect in the European Union but pressure could yet come to bear.  I take the point that the more regulatory supervision is done at European level, the more we are safeguarded from pressures but one of the things that came out of the banking inquiry was how deregulation in the IFSC washed back into the domestic economy.  Professor Gregory Connor said the IFSC specialised in regulatory arbitrage and tax arrangements that pushed at the limits, which is what offshore centres do but was done to excess in some cases in the IFSC.

The Bank of England has suggested that is an underestimate and the ECB has also pointed to a significant relaxation of underwriting standards for US and European leveraged loans being observed in recent years.  The likelihood of international contagion and system-wide spillovers is elevated in the context of a global search for yield and the figures for European leveraged loans indicates that we are almost at the levels of 2007.

There is a great deal of interesting material - I will turn to Mr. Sibley in a moment - but one basic point is that some of the lessons have been learned.  For instance, one of the vicious spiral dynamics in 2007 was various types of loans being funded very short term.  For many of those leveraged loans the funding line is significantly longer in maturity.  The issue of a panic leading to the death of these entities very quickly does not arise.<\/p> <p>  There are plenty of reasons for us to look at this because it has been growing quite a bit.

It has not come to my attention that there has been a systemic deviation from that.  I have read some of these contracts and I have gone through contracts.  Often with contracts - even with that first page - is the way the interest rate is laid out is not a fixed number.  When one looks at the phrasing of what the interest rate will be, it leads to some of these problems of ambiguity and so on.  When the Chairman says it is very simple, it is not simple to express the interest rate unless it is a plain vanilla-type tracker mortgage where it is the European Central Bank rate plus a fixed margin.  Most tracker mortgages have been fine.  They have been simple and have been adhered to from day one.  The problems typically emerge either when the contract has not been clear or there has been some event such as moving between a fixed and a tracker mortgage.  We can follow up on this but it is not my understanding that there has been a systemic deviation from legal obligations to write that front page.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#PP00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>This is what I have found.

If that is not on the contract, according to the legislation, a &quot;mortgage lender who is party to an agreement referred to in <i>subsection (1) <\/i>shall ensure that the agreement complies with that subsection.&quot;  The offences against that are set out thereafter.  The legislation states the Central Bank will enforce this.  My point to Professor Lane is that I have now seen evidence where this was ignored and it seems that it happened across the banks.<\/p><p>Even if it did not happen across the banks, it states that if someone makes a complaint to the Central Bank, the bank is supposed to act because it is the body that provides oversight and enforcement of the Act.

What we recognised is that in complicated situations where people might have an expectation of getting a tracker mortgage at a point in time from what was done or said, they should have the benefit of that protection.  Neither what is written down on that document or what is written down in a contract would have served the expectation for those customers.  That is what we mean when we talk about the transparency obligations.  We mean what advertisements might have said or circumstances in which, in an engagement with a member of staff of a bank, a customer was given an idea that he or she might get a tracker later.  When we were looking at the tracker issue, we looked at all of those kinds of things to inform us in terms of the factors that go into a customer journey at a point in time.  We looked at what they could have reasonably understood to help them in their decision making at the time.  This would be details written on the front sheet, details written in the contract and things that were done and said through advertisements or engagements with customers.  We take all of those matters into account.<\/p> <p>  Separately, on the content of the front cover sheets, that is, the key information that is present in a contract and has to complied with under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, if that gives rise to a tracker mortgage issue, of course we would look at that.  However, that information may not give rise to a tracker mortgage issue for the reasons that I have explained.  It is true that the key information for a customer should be on the front of that document but it has been our experience that we had to go wider when we were looking at tracker mortgages to make sure we felt everyone had been dealt with fairly.

A lot of points have been covered, so I will try not to be repetitive.  I am not sure anybody referred to the limits in terms of house prices and mortgages and so on.  There are mixed views on that.  Some would argue that it is suppressing prices and keeping a lid on them.  Others would say that it is not allowing people who want to be able to buy to get on the market at all, because their salary multiplied by three and a half times will not get to anywhere near the price they want to buy at.  I think it is keeping prices down and that is not a bad thing for anyone trying to buy.  What are the bank's thoughts on this issue?

Clearly, we have two sets of rules.  One is the loan-to-income ceiling.  The other is the loan-to-value ratios.  What has happened over the past year or so is that the loan-to-income ceiling has started to bite.  Essentially, people may have deposits, but the three and half times income is limiting their ability.<\/p> <p>  One point to make is that we recognise that that kind of ceiling should have exceptions to it.  In the case of a younger person starting off in his or her career, for example, he or she could make the case that his or her income in five to ten years will be higher than today, so perhaps that person can afford more than three and a half times his or her current income.  That is reasonable and that is why we have the system of allowances.<\/p> <p>  In the end, the thinking behind the loan-to-income rule, which is an anchor of the system, is to avoid a situation we had before where house prices depart from income.  In the mid-2000s, the ratio of house prices to income climbed a lot higher than that.  The three and half times income is an average over a long period of the historical relationship between mortgages and incomes.<\/p><p>It is biting and that is maybe the point, which is to ensure that house prices do not go too far above incomes.  I will qualify that by saying that this is only in relation to those who have the income levels needed to compete for the house prices we are seeing.  It is not a commentary on the fact that there is an affordability issue here.  Many people on middle or lower incomes are unable to buy houses in the range that they could afford.  I share with the whole system a concern about the availability of affordable housing.  As the Senator knows, there will be a mix of more social housing through different channels.  As the amount of house building increases, I hope more houses will be built in that category to satisfy the provision of starter homes for regular people in the community.  There are more houses being built this year than last year and there are more coming on stream for next year.  The affordability issue is a concern.  The fact that house prices are stabilising or coming down a bit because of the rules shows the rules are having an impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#SS00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":641,"content":"<p>On a related point, many people are paying significant amounts of money in rent at the moment.  If they were able to get on the housing ladder, they would be paying far less than they pay on rent.  In the case of those who have paid rent for four, five or six years, could the Central Bank allow the banks to recognise in some way that these people have consistently been paying monthly rents of &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500, given that a mortgage payment might be much less, perhaps &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,500 per month?  There does not appear to be a mechanism to give recognition to people who cannot save for a deposit because they are paying so much in rent.  It is very difficult for them to put a deposit together.  I do not want people to be over-indebted or find themselves in circumstances in which they will lose their homes.

At the level of showing a consistent track record of paying significant rent, our view is that this is something the bank should be looking at in assessing the capacity of that individual couple to pay a mortgage.  The question then is whether the rules should be different for that category.  That is where we would say \"No\".  It is still important to have a deposit because it protects the individual from negative equity risk.  The deposit is, therefore, needed.<\/p> <p>  As to the loan-to-income issue, we still think it is necessary to have a relationship between the loan and income levels because we know from historical experience that when loans are too high relative to incomes today, it may be cheaper than paying the rent today or for the next two years or five years but, with the risk of a downturn, we may see a loss of income.  The loss of employment is a bigger probability in a downturn.  This brings us back to the data analysis behind our decisions.  We know that loan by loan and experience by experience the loan-to-income ratio has been an important factor as to whether a person ends up in arrears and in a difficult position.  This is a difficult situation and the key is to build more houses and, in turn, the price of housing coming down so that the rules that we think are important can be met, while still delivering the housing people need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#TT00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>On the Governor's point on changing circumstances, downturns in the economy and so on, one of the chief executives who appeared before the committee - I think he was from KBC Bank - stated that we are closer to the next recession than we are to the previous one.

I intend to take this up in a speech or a paper in the coming weeks.  This is a very important issue.  It is a separate issue from the risk of recession.  The world can slow down and so on and for that reason, as I indicated in my opening statement, we turned on this extra capital buffer called the countercyclical capital buffer.  That is to recognise when the economy has advanced to where we have unemployment of around 5% now, that is much more cyclically advanced than it was when unemployment was 15%.  There is that cyclical risk, which is normal up-and-down economics.<\/p> <p>  The big issue, which the Senator referred to, is that Ireland also faces structural risk.  The structure of the economy, with this dependence on multinationals, which in many ways has delivered a lot, is risky.  There is a structural risk there.  With the interest rate environment, there is a cyclical component to interest rates, but there is also a big long-term issue, where if one opens any economics journal, the discussion is how interest rates have come down on a long-term basis.  The question then is whether those corporation tax revenues will remain high for a long time and whether interest rates will remain low for a long time, regardless of what is happening with the short-term business cycle.  When one has those structural risks - my deputy, Ms Sharon Donnery, made a speech a number of weeks ago along the same lines - that is why we believe the system needs high capital buffers.  We believe we need these robust mortgage rules and we say all the time that if the Government wants the ability to run a relaxed fiscal policy during the next downturn, which is important, it needs to build up the surpluses, going to above zero.  Getting to zero is much better than not getting to zero, but going into significant surplus, if conditions are good, will give the Government more room in the next downturn to avoid austerity, and to increase spending and maintain it in a downturn, which is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#UU00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>On the &euro;665 million that has been paid out on the track mortgage issue, is there a breakdown of redress versus compensation?

We have been particularly focused on risk and Mr. Sibley might speak on the wider risk considerations because they are important.  There are risks the banks pose to their consumers through their consumer culture and attitudes.  We approached the banks' boards to discuss our expectations and get a feel for their views and for how committed we thought they were to addressing the matter properly.  Culture cannot be changed overnight.  I heard a wonderful phrase that compared it to a lifestyle change rather than a New Year's resolution.  If one is truly committed to changing the culture, there must be a serious programme, spanning a number of years, on the most important areas of focus .  We found that the banks had only recently developed a true consumer focus and that there were significant deficits in some of their leadership and their degree of optimism because they had emerged from a crisis and might have had an unrealistic view of what they faced in the future.<\/p> <p>  We put the expert team back together more recently.  Our Dutch colleagues, who are world leaders in cultural assessment, returned to work with our prudential and conduct colleagues, who met to consider the plans they had submitted to us on how they would approach the issue.  We evaluated those plans, some of which we are pleased with.  We believe that if they implement those proposals with vigour, it will be a good outcome.  On the other hand, we were disappointed with some of the plans because we thought they reflected too much optimism and lacked the detail we expect to see.  In future, from both a prudential and conduct perspective, the plans will be a priority for us.  We will meet the CEOs of the banks again to give them our feedback on the quality of those plans and, as we roll out the different parts of our supervisory exercises, we will examine what we consider to be the most important transmission points for cultural risk to consumers, such as the sales channels and incentives.  When we examine products and demand they demonstrate to us the groups to whom their products should be sold, for whom they are suitable and for whom they should confer a benefit, we check that against whom they actually sell to, which should tell us all we need to know about a consumer-focused culture because customers should be able to gain an appreciable benefit from the products they buy in the medium and long terms.<\/p> <p>  We want to see that kind of approach and, as a result, we have strengthened our approach to consumer protection and are becoming firmer and more specific.  It is a continuous part of what we expect but, ultimately, culture is something the firms must change and is the responsibility of the board to lead on.  We need to see that transmitted through the pressed middle to the front-line staff, who need to be supported by their leaders in delivering the consumer focus we expect to see.  It is a journey on which we will need to see the banks' demonstrable commitment over a matter of years rather than being a flash in the pan that they can speak about the following year after it goes away.  We will demand that from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#VV00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":656,"content":"<p>If one puts similar people in similar circumstances and asks them to make similar decisions, there are likely to be similar outcomes, which is why we have focused on both culture and diversity for a number of years.

We can see there have been some incremental improvements across the financial system and, in particular, in banking.  When the CEOs appear before the committee, members will see there are different faces and a bit more diversity.  In the case of those who lead the revenue generation parts of their businesses, however, such as the chief financial officers, who drive the business forward, one will typically see similar people.<\/p> <p>  We are continuing to drive, therefore, to enhancing significantly the level of diversity in financial institutions in order that there will be people with different views and that we will prevent groupthink.

For shops, cash is increasingly a security risk and insisting that everyone must pay by tapping a card may make sense for an individual shopkeeper but, as the Senator has outlined, it may exclude some people.  We have an internal desire for this question to become more of a national one again.  Before the crisis, there was some advancement in developing financial literacy and capability at a national, systemic level, but then we all went into crisis-fighting mode and it all fell away.

As Ms Rowland said, our approach to consumer protection should add this extra layer of looking closely, firm by firm, at what is going on.

That is the line of travel.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit, the reality for whoever will come into my position is that it is not just an issue of what will happen in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>It will be a long-term issue in the context of the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union.<\/p><p> On organisational capability, the Central Bank failed before the crisis.  There has been a big rebuilding effort since.  Much has been done in expanding staff numbers, as well as improving IT and other facilities.  One cannot have an understaffed Central Bank.  It is an ongoing issue to ensure the organisation is excellent and up to the job.

Paris has quite a lot of trading floors and there is a match with the skills available in the city.  Ireland has a lot of asset managers and risk and compliance-type functions.  The single financial system in Europe means there can be different clusters in different cities.  Frankfurt also has a cluster of banks.

I genuinely believe the Central Bank has got this very wrong.  I cannot for the life of me understand how it has allowed the banks to engineer a rate that did not exist.  I refer to where there is ambiguity in the contract.  Ms Rowland, Professor Lane and Mr. Sibley all mentioned ambiguity in the contract.  If there is ambiguity in the contract, one must operate in favour of the borrower, as stated in law.  That is very clear.  For the Central Bank to say the prevailing rate at the time in question did not exist because the product did not exist will not stand up to legal challenge.  This will be challenged in court.<br\/><br\/>I note the report the Central Bank gave this committee in which it states this issue was tested legally by it.  I understand it was not a unanimous view and that there was not a case here that could be presented.  I may be mistaken in that regard.  I am concerned about requiring 6,000 customers to go through an appeals process.  Some will not bother doing so.<br\/><br\/>Ms Rowland talked about the Central Bank&rsquo;s track record.  Its track record in recent years has been good, apart from in respect of a number of small issues, the one in question being an example.  The Central Bank was asleep at the wheel for a long time before recent years.  A considerable amount of money was taken from people although the Central Bank's role is consumer protection.<br\/><br\/>One of the key moments was the case of Irish Life and Permanent plc <i>v<\/i>. Financial Services Ombudsman and others, heard by Mr. Justice Hogan.  The defence put up by Permanent TSB at the time was that the contract was broken.  Mr. Justice Hogan was very clear in his deliberations and findings.  He made it clear that if a key clause of this kind is to bear sophisticated construction, it behoves the bank to spell this out in plain language for the benefit of the customer.  AIB provided this committee with the contracts.  They are standard contracts.  They are ambiguous.  They refer to a prevailing rate that does not exist.  They outline the rate in Part 1 and in a different part outline that the tracker rate is set out in Part 1.  It is, at the least, ambiguous.  Therefore, there is a failure to outline the rate clearly.  What it indicates is an intention to apply a rate applicable to the market conditions of the time but that is not what is in the contract.  A clause refers to the prevailing rate and a later clause stipulates it is set out in Part 1.<br\/><br\/>Based on legal premises, the Central Bank has got this wrong.  If there is ambiguity in the contract, which there clearly is, it should never be the bank that benefits.  Ms Rowland will know this better than I do.  It has to be the borrower.  By not taking this case, the Central Bank is really failing the customers concerned.  What is happening is not right for individuals who will take this case.  I hope they win.  I am confident about this.  Much legal opinion has been sought from very eminent individuals in regard to this matter and it indicates it should not be the banks that benefit.  The elephant in the room is consumer protection under the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>I have listened to Professor Lane and I respect him and the job he does but the Bill sponsored by Deputy Moran was regarded as no good, the idea that there should be no sale to the vultures without consent was regarded as no good, and Deputy Michael McGrath&rsquo;s Bill about capping interest rates was regarded as no good.  The Central Bank was also critical of the proposal on the regulation of the funds.  There are four items of legislation on consumer protection - one already in law, one from the Government and one from me - but the  Central Bank stands foursquare against them.  It stands in the corner of the banks and the vulture funds.  This points to the main contradiction.  The Central Bank has the dual role of protecting the interest of the banks and, supposedly at the same time, protecting the interests of the public.  That is best shown in the ten years of the tracker mortgage scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#CCC00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553558400,"counter":712,"content":"<p>Let me respond on two levels.  I will first deal with the issue of the prevailing rate and then the wider issue of the mandate.  On the issue of the prevailing rate, the Deputy should think about why we are here.  We absolutely know we have two mandates.  They are not ranked.  The consumer protection mandate is as important as the financial stability mandate.  I assure the Deputy that the making of the decision on the prevailing rate did not have any financial stability factor whatsoever.  It was entirely based on what we believed we could stand over.  As Ms Rowland stated earlier, it was based on whether we could challenge the interpretation we had on what was meant.  It is not the case that the decision was driven by any other concern.<\/p> <p>  This is a whole-bank initiative. We have an excellent internal team of lawyers whose role is to work out what we can do within the legal framework we have.  This has been such a body of work, especially driven by the people on the front line of consumer protection.  The only reason these staff work for the Central Bank is to protect consumers.  There is such a dedicated team, such that we have done everything we regard possible within the legal limits.  As the Deputy said, this issue could well arise in a courtroom.  Let us see what happens.  We took the view, however, that this could not go further than where it went.  This may go back to the question of what the famous phrase meant.<\/p> <p>  Let me come to the wider issue.  This is ongoing.  We have had this conversation repeatedly.  I am absolutely clear that, irrespective of how much members may disagree with and criticise our consumer protection work, consumer protection would be at a lower level if it were run by a different agency.  When we think about consumer protection, we are not thinking only about the individual in trouble with a particular mortgage.  We also have to think about all the consumers who are paying at high interest rates on their mortgages and all future consumers who may be looking for loans.  Let us say some of the legislation benefited a particular group.  It would have to be assessed based on whether it leads to higher costs elsewhere or to the risk of the financial system going into distress.  When the new Central Bank law was introduced in 2010, the first wave of comments, which I read in the Oireachtas debates, there was repeated commentary to the effect that consumers are not protect if there is financial instability.  Therefore, in regard to the legislation in question, we place a lot of emphasis on the view that ultimately there is not really tension between consumer protection and financial stability.  An unstable financial system does not protect consumers.  That is our perspective.  A separate consumer protection agency would not deliver in the same way as the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019032600002#EEE00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Our guests should have taken the break when the Chair offered it earlier.

These are people who have been turned away by the banks and they are receiving these cheaper, more favourable mortgages.  Given that, we think the risk of default will be higher.  On the other hand, they are receiving cheaper mortgages which are locked in for the duration of the mortgage.  Those who have access are benefitting.  It is a beneficial product.

From a pragmatic point of view, our primary focus is on ensuring that staff based in offices in Gaeltacht areas can conduct business in Irish.  We are happy that business can be conducted with our customers fully in Irish on a day-to-day basis in our fishery harbour centres in Ros an Mh&iacute;l and an Daingean.  As I have said, ten of the staff can conduct business fully through Irish.  The other three have good conversational Irish and some of them are undertaking further study.<\/p> <p>  To return to inspections, we have three designated agricultural officers to cover the western coast and they can go further afield.  We are caught between providing service through Irish and EU regulations on providing the short notice period which the Deputy has mentioned.  We may have to examine how we can satisfy the two competing demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019032600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Mahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1553558400,"counter":781,"content":"<p>N&iacute; ghlacaim le short notice mar leithsc&eacute;al in aon chor.

Ba mhaith liom soil&eacute;iri&uacute; air sin fosta.<\/p><p>The first issue we have is recruitment.  Our big problem with that is that we recruit specialised people with certain skills and to the extent that they have Irish is dependent a little bit on the outside of that because we cannot recruit somebody who has Irish and then train them into a specialised area such as a vet or an inspector.  It is something that we look for but we do not necessarily have the choice.  If we have a vacancy, we have to fill it, and if the appropriate people do not have Irish, it is unfortunate but the priority has to be to get the job done, to get the inspections done and to get the payments made.  In the Gaeltacht areas, particularly in two fishery harbours, Irish is a requirement.  We would not necessarily recruit somebody but we still have to keep the harbours open if it came down to not having somebody.  In those areas we tend to be able to attract somebody.<\/p><p> It is not that we are against it.  As we discovered in our Irish language section, we recruited an individual who was then attracted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is to be lauded, they are moving ahead and that is fine, but we could not actually get somebody who had Irish at that level.  We even looked into getting somebody at a higher level from another Public Appointments Service recruitment campaign that would have been at administrative officer level, and we could not attract one of them to move to the office in Port Laoise.  It is not that we are not trying or that we do not want it, it is just that we are restricted by what is available to us.  We would certainly be interested in ways around that but the priority is having somebody with the skills to do the job and then, unfortunately, the Irish is desirable but not essential in the same way.  That is not in any way to denigrate what this committee is about, but it is a bigger problem than just what we can do in the Department.  However, if we can do something, we are certainly interested in doing it.<\/p><p> I cannot speak about Raphoe.
