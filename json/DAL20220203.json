I understand that all former job clubs' staff in Laois-Offaly were offered employment under existing terms and conditions by the new provider.

However, on 15 December 2021, the Workplace Relations Commission wrote to my Department regarding ongoing work stoppages in job clubs in Offaly and Laois.

My Department is not the employer of any of its service partners' staff, nor is it a party to an industrial dispute with any of its service partners or their employees.

My question was motivated by a number of factors.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why we are reverting to something that could be an inconvenience.  I understand that social welfare payments to recipients were always made via post offices, but there was a break from the norm.  During that time, was there evidence of an increase in welfare fraud, for example?  I asked for a rationale for the decision and it cannot just be to revert to what was the previous situation, which might not have been beneficial, or be about the post office network.

The past two years were tough for many.  I wholeheartedly welcome the bonus of &euro;1,000 for front-line healthcare workers, including ambulance workers and others.

We all know the carers in our communities, as I am sure the Minister does.  I ask the Minister to go back to Cabinet and fight for carers at this particular time.  There are carers living in rural areas who have to pay for fuel for going to hospital appointments and so on, and for energy to heat their homes.  The Minister knows of the extra costs involved.

That change means that all carers currently are reduced rate of payment will see their payment increase from next June.  It will also mean that tens of thousands more carers, who did not qualify up to this point due to the income threshold, will now qualify for the payment.  The increase in the income disregard for a couple was something that I really wanted to improve, because I was aware that in many cases a partner who was a carer, and usually a mother, might have to give up her job to care for a sick child, but because the husband was working or they had savings, they just did not qualify for the benefit.  As a result of the changes I am making, a couple can earn up to &euro;750 a week, and the first &euro;50,000 in savings will not be impacted or counted.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;273 million this year on household benefits, supporting more than 484,000 households.  As part of the overall welfare budget package of &euro;600 million in increases that I secured for 2022, I was pleased to be able to increase the fuel allowance payment by &euro;5 per week, effective from budget night.  The rate now stands at &euro;33 per week and supports more than  375,000 customers, at an overall cost estimate for 2022 of &euro;366 million.  Other payments, such as increases for qualified children, the living alone allowance and the working family payment, are also shown to be effective in supporting those households who will be most challenged by increases in energy costs.  Again, I was pleased to be able to bring forward increases in these payments, valued at &euro;98 million in a full year, as part of budget 2022.  Any decision to enhance the household benefits package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations.<\/p> <p>In addition to the regular weekly and monthly payments, the Department can also support people through the use of discretionary payments, including the exceptional needs payment and a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.

Throughout the pandemic, post offices stayed open and continued working under very difficult conditions.  Indeed, many of them are part of a shop and many of those shopkeepers stepped up to the plate and delivered groceries to their customers when nobody else could.  I know that is what my local post office in the village beside me did.  They delivered and helped people and we have to recognise that.  My Department and myself are very appreciative of the sterling work carried out by post office workers who ensured that a full range of services continued to be delivered to the public through the past two difficult years.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is the largest customer of An Post.  More than 24 million social welfare payments were issued via post offices last year and I was pleased to announce recently that the Department has renewed its contract with An Post for cash payment services for another year.  This year, my Department expects to spend approximately &euro;56 million in fees to An Post for over-the-counter cash payments and for postage.  Last week, I was pleased to announce that payments for all new jobseeker applications will be dealt with directly in post offices.

The programme for Government commits to introducing a pensions automatic enrolment system.  The objective of this commitment is to increase the proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.<\/p>  <p>  According to figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the rate of supplementary pension coverage is around 56% of the working population.  This is based on the Pension Coverage Survey 2021.  It is estimated that this figure reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  As a consequence of this low supplementary pension coverage rate, many retirees may suffer an unwanted reduction in living standards when they retire.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, recognising the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are under as a result of the Covid-19 emergency, will seek to gradually deliver an automatic enrolment system.

The national disability inclusion strategy provides the overarching framework for policy and actions relating to people with disabilities.  The Government has decided that the cost of disability report is to be referred to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which will take responsibility for monitoring actions taken by Departments on foot of the research.

From the perspective of my Department, it is worth noting a number of measures were introduced as part of budget 2022 for people with disabilities and their carers that will go towards alleviating the financial costs experienced.  These include a combination of core weekly payment rate increases, increases in earnings disregards and supports to employers.  Furthermore, under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, my Department has a commitment to develop and consult on a \"strawman\" proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.

The cost of disability amounts to the extra spending that a person with a disability must face in daily life that able-bodied people do not have to face.  It is the same for a family with a member with a disability.  This report puts the average additional cost of disability to a person with a severe disability at between &euro;9,600 and &euro;12,300.  For a person with a less severe disability, the cost is between &euro;8,700 and &euro;10,000.  These are averages so clearly there are some people and families spending a lot more than that.  The cost depends on the severity of the disability and where the person resides.  There are also unmet costs for many as they are currently unaffordable.

The Deputy knows that currently it is a flat rate of &euro;208 whether a person has a mild, moderate or profound disability.  Some people with a mild disability could do some work, as we know, and there are others with a profound disability who cannot work at all.  Should the payment be graduated?

We have a very poor record of employment for disabled people in this country and more support must be provided for people to support themselves.  Perhaps, for example, we can revise the current timeframes for reducing social welfare supports for people going back to work or engaging in self-employment.  Perhaps we could introduce appropriate training tailored to the individuals, as training for an able-bodied person would be different from that of a disabled person.

This process culminated in the establishment of a joint labour committee, which began meeting in December 2021 and which, hopefully, will result in an employment regulation order.  With that order, supported by the new core funding stream I announced in budget 2022, there is now a real prospect of improvement in pay rates through the joint labour committee.  The scale of allocation under the new core funding is significant.  It is &euro;69 million in 2022, equivalent to more than &euro;207 million in a full year, and it will enable employers to meet the new pay scales coming from an employment regulation order.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2021, I published Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, which includes commitments to deliver career pathways, promote careers in the sector, and strengthen supports for continuing professional development.

I know there is strong interest locally.  I have recently received correspondence from Cavan County Council in this regard.  The response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, is a cross-departmental and multi-agency issue.  It is co-ordinated by the Department of Justice.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides supports for victims of domestic violence, primarily funded through NGO service providers.  In 2021, Tusla allocated &euro;28 million in core funding for DSGBV, plus &euro;2 million in contingency funding to address Covid challenges.  In 2022, the allocation will be &euro;31 million, amounting to a &euro;3 million increase in core funding.  Funding in 2022 will support services to address cost pressures and maintain continued services, including core sustainability costs and the ongoing supportive initiatives commenced in 2021.  The additional allocation will also fund the beginning of the implementation of the accommodation review.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Tusla that support for victims of DSGBV in counties Cavan and Monaghan is available through the services of Tearmann, which is based in County Monaghan and funded by the Tusla.  Tearmann also provides outreach services in both counties.  Tusla funded Tearmann in 2021 to the value of &euro;214,000.<\/p>  <p>  The Tusla review of the provision of accommodation for victims of domestic violence has assessed the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation.  It has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for service, unmet need and the analysis of proximity to refuges by local communities.  The review has been completed and publication is expected in the next two weeks.  The Government will be guided by the recommendations of the review.  I expect the implementation process for the review will identify priority areas where there is the greatest need for providing safe accommodation for victims of DSGBV.

There are only two or three members of staff employed in that service and they do a lot of outreach work.<\/p>  <p>  According to Safe Ireland, 808 requests for refuge could not be met last year.  As we know, the nature of an abuser is to isolate the victim from family and support.  Victims go to a refuge seeking support because they do not have anywhere else to go.

This provided services with grants ranging from &euro;1,500 to &euro;4,500.  The rental or purchase of HEPA filters is among the items of eligible expenditure under this grant programme and guidance has been provided on the HEPA filters that are suitable for use in childcare settings.  The grant programme opened for applications on 16 December.  The original closing date of 7 January 2022 but we extended it to 31 January 2022 so that as many services as possible could avail of this grant.  Some 4,109 services have now applied the grant which means that 95% of eligible services have made an application.<\/p>  <p>  That &euro;10 million grant programme is just part of a suite of supports provided to the early learning and childcare sector since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Other supports include tailored funding arrangements during periods of closure and restricted access to services, a range of capital programmes, an antigen programme, sector-specific infection prevention and control guidelines and access to the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, with an exemption to the turnover rule.  The provision of the EWSS at the full rate is equal to an investment of &euro;34 million per month.  The value of EWSS at standard rates is equal to an investment in the sector of &euro;22 million per month.  That additional money has allowed for sector-specific public health guidance to be implemented.  The most important aspect of this is the play pod system that has been implemented since the beginning of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>There is strong evidence that these Covid-19 supports are helping and supporting the early learning and care sector.  Recent Tusla data show that the number of early learning and childcare settings that closed completely decreased significantly in 2021 compared with the previous two years.  Data from the Revenue Commissions show that the number of staff employed in the sector has held steady.

The consequence of low pay, the high turnover of staff, undermines the quality of children's early learning experiences.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has, over a number of years, provided a range of financial supports to providers in the sector to support them to improve pay and conditions.  Measures that are still in place include higher rates of capitation payments to services with graduate room leaders in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and to services employing qualified inclusion co-ordinators.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2020, I began a process which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions through the use of a joint labour committee.  That committee has now been established and started meeting in December of last year.  To support the joint labour committee in drawing up an employment regulation order to determine minimum rates of pay, I secured a very significant additional investment in budget 2022, fulfilling a key commitment in the programme for Government.  There is &euro;69 million available this year and &euro;207 million available in a full year.  I hope to see the joint labour committee bring forward its recommendations in the coming months.

We spoke about those earlier.  I refer especially to a new core funding stream for services to support improved quality, affordability and sustainability and to support the drawing up of the employment regulation order, which is so important in getting better paper staff.  That measure is being introduced.  It will be worth &euro;69 million this year, and &euro;207 million in a full year.

The full implementation of all its recommendations will be progressed in the coming years, as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process.

The 50 cent per hour subvention, which is a part of that scheme and which every parent received for a child aged between zero and three attending childcare, has been extended.  In September this year, that subvention will cover those aged from zero to 15.  Therefore, any child aged between zero and 15 attending childcare will get a 50 cent subvention per hour.  This is a first step, but it is an important one, because all children will now be getting a basic level of subvention from the State for the childcare they receive.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the wider recommendations of the expert group, one I am particularly passionate about pursuing is the DEIS-type model and approach to dealing with disadvantage within the early years sector.

The project comprises a suite of research and data activities that will strengthen our understanding of the lives of children in care and adults who have been in care.  This work will provide us with much-needed insights into their experiences and valuable evidence about their outcomes.  The project, which is a key priority of mine, will inform the development of effective and responsive policies in my Department and services, but also across government, that best serve the needs of children and young people in the care of the State.  It will encompass a ten-year longitudinal study of children transitioning from care, in line with the recommendations of the Ryan report, but will also include other bespoke studies on children in care to complement improved data systems.  The project will be led by my Department, with Tusla as a key partner.<\/p>  <p>  There are five basic elements to the project.  First, there is the development and agreement of a project plan informed by meaningful consultation with stakeholders.  We are starting that now.  Second, there is ongoing development of the capacity of the national child care information system, NCCIS, in Tusla to track dynamically the individual pathways of children through care.  Third, there will be a once-off study of a cohort of children who left care ten years ago in order that we can immediately get some understanding of young adults ten years after care.  As I mentioned, there is the longitudinal study, starting with a cohort of children who are aged 16 and then engaging with them for the subsequent ten years of their lives, again looking at outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  The project will facilitate further bespoke research studies on children in care and aftercare where more detailed information is needed about their circumstances.

Focus Ireland has described this as a cliff edge, with one third of those who have left care being either homeless or at risk of homelessness.  Children who were in care are over-represented in the prison system.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust found that in 2019 40% of young people in Oberstown Children Detention Campus had been in care or had significant involvement with Tusla.

As he knows, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has announced a scheme for regularisation, which is open to people who have been in the international protection process for a number of years.  We reckon that approximately 2,800 of them will be able to apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300019#R00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1643888400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Would they be in direct provision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300019#R00500","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1643888400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Yes.

Over the past seven months, the scheme has been particularly important to Ireland's rapid response to the situation in Afghanistan.  We have issued 550 visas to people fleeing Afghanistan who were at real risk of losing their lives.  Many of them are in emergency reception and orientation centres, EROCs, across the country, but they will then move into the community.  Many of them are being supported by community sponsorship groups.  Deputies may know of groups that are interested in doing something like this.  It is definitely a commitment, but a valuable one in terms of the provision of accommodation and the support from and link with local communities.

There is absolutely no doubt about that.  In the 12 months to December, inflation reached the highest levels in 20 years.  Rents are spiralling out of control as a result of the Government's housing plan.  Childcare costs amount to a second mortgage for many families.  Putting food on the table and running your car has never been more expensive.  Energy prices rose by 27% and the cost of home-heating oil has soared by 53%.  Prices will continue to rise, with workers and families under pressure like never before.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has had months to deal with the cost-of-living crisis but it failed to come up with a comprehensive plan to support these households.  Instead the Government is trading sound bites with leaks from parliamentary party meetings rather than real and immediate action.  The Irish people deserve a Government that understands the difficulties that they are facing, not a Government that ignores, delays or, indeed, even makes things worse in some cases.  The time to act is long overdue.<\/p>  <p>  Not all households will feel the cost-of-living crisis equally.  We know from the CSO that the poorest households spend three times more of their income on heating and lighting their homes than the richest households, and that those in the middle spend twice as much as those at the higher end.<\/p>  <p>  For months, Sinn F&eacute;in has been raising the issues of the cost of living with the T&aacute;naiste, with the Government and with the Taoiseach, and we have been bringing forward proposals that the Government has rejected over and over again.  Since September, before the budget, we told the Government that what was needed was a &euro;10 increase in core social welfare rates to protect those most in need of support.  What the Government provided did not even keep up with price increases and, therefore, it is a de facto cut.  These families will be poorer this year than they were last year.  We must see an additional &euro;5 increase in these core rates to prevent families and children from being worse off this year than they were last year.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have called for an extension of the fuel allowance season by two weeks and for the eligibility criteria to be expanded so that more people can avail of the fuel allowance.  The Government has also refused to deal with this.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to halt its plans.  It is just crazy that, within three months, the Government plans to increase the cost of home-heating oil and gas by heaping on another carbon tax on those commodities despite the fact that home-heating oil has increased by 53% in the past year and energy prices are up by 27%.  The Government needs to stop that increase that is about to take effect on 1 May.<\/p>  <p>  We have called for a refundable tax credit equivalent to one month's rent putting up to &euro;1,500 back in renters' pockets to deal with the fact that rents are out of control - rising by over 8% - and we need to ban rent increases for the next three years.  That is some of the action that is required.<\/p>  <p>  These are some of the measures that the T&aacute;naiste and the Government could take to deal with the cost-of-living crisis.  Far from trading soundbites at the T&aacute;naiste's parliamentary party meetings and selective leaks, let us deal and get on with the job that Deputy Varadkar was elected to do.  Let us govern.  Let us make sure that people are protected.<\/p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste plan to take any meaningful action in relation to this situation rather than issue soundbites?

We have already taken action, much of which was opposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty's party, and some of which was not.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge, though, that the action that we have taken to help families with the cost of living is not enough and for that reason, the three party leaders, when we met on Monday night, commissioned line Ministers to develop proposals for a package of measures that will allow us to help families with the cost of living.  That is being worked on at present, with further discussions on it today.  I am meeting with the unions and employers this afternoon and there will be a chance to discuss it then.  There will be a committee meeting of the economic Cabinet committee which I chair next week which will provide another chance to discuss it as well.  We will make a decision on it soon, certainly in the next couple of weeks, because we acknowledge that the cost of living is rising, that it is causing a huge squeeze for many families and that as a Government we have to do something about it.  We are aware that other Governments in other parts of the world have taken action too and we believe we must do so as well.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the context, it is important to bear in mind that when the budget was prepared in September and October last, the estimates for inflation were somewhere between 2% and 3% and we built the budget on that basis.  However, that has not been the case.  It turns out that inflation has been much higher.  It is in and around 5%, and rather than being a temporary phenomenon, while it might moderate, it looks like we may be stuck with high inflation for a longer period than we would have anticipated.  When the facts change you need to adjust your policies and that is what we intend to do.<\/p>  <p>  Back as far as last March, I was talking about the possibility of inflation.  As far back as last June, I was strongly advocating for a personal tax package, welfare increases and pension increases in the budget, and we achieved that.  That was done.  Perhaps it was not adequate but it was done.  Let us not forget that Deputy Pearse Doherty's party opposed the reductions in personal taxation.  I advocated reductions in personal taxation to make sure that people getting a pay increase got to keep it because people earning over &euro;38,000 who get a pay increase lose half of it in income tax.  I wanted to make sure that people getting a pay increase - thankfully, most people will get a pay increase this year - got to hold onto it.  The Deputy did not want that.  I also wanted to make sure that those workers who do not get a pay increase - Deputy Pearse Doherty might not realise this but there some workers who will not get a pay increase this year because their employer will not or cannot provide it - would get something and the Deputy opposed that too.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in needs to be honest about its positions as a party.  It might be the case that the Deputy objects to increases in carbon tax because of climate scepticism etc. but he also objects to reductions in personal taxation.  The truth is, when it comes to after-tax income, significant numbers of middle-income people in the State would be worse off if Sinn F&eacute;in's budget had been introduced rather than ours.  That is a fact.  We acknowledge that things have changed since then, the cost of living has increased by more than anticipated and we need to act on that.  We are working on those proposals now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300021#T00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1643889600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>The cost-of-living crisis did not just fall from the sky overnight.

The Government plans to increase the cost of oil and gas for households on 1 May, less than three months from now.  The price of gas will increase by &euro;17 and by &euro;19 for every fill of home heating oil.  The cost of the latter has already increased by 53%.

That is clear.  People on lower incomes spend more on energy and fuel, or a higher percentage of their income on energy, fuel and groceries than those on higher incomes.  As a consequence of that - the Deputy is right about this - inflation impacts on different households in different ways.  At the moment, inflation is impacting more seriously on lower income households than higher income households.  In recognition of that, in the budget we did increase core social welfare rates.  We also increased the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and the child dependant allowance.  We did those things precisely because it was the lowest incomes that were impacted most.  As I said earlier, we acknowledge that more needs to be done.  We are working on those proposals now.  I hear the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal for an increase in core social welfare rates.  The difficulty with that is that a lot of working people are not on social welfare.

Four years later, the European Commission is not very impressed with the Government's progress.  A director in the European Commission's Directorate-General for Environment, Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, recently gave a speech in which he did not just give the Government both barrels, he actually rolled up in a tank and launched a volley of heavy fire in its direction.  I do not have time to list all the egregious breaches of environmental laws and standards that he cited among his laundry list of complaints, but I will just give a flavour.  He noted that 50% of Ireland's urban waste water is still not treated in compliance with the urban waste water treatment directive.  In case there is any doubt about how shameful this is, it should be noted that said directive dates from 1991.  Leakage rates are one of the highest in Europe, currently at an enormous 40%.  The water framework directive has still not been fully implemented.  The deadline for that was 2003.  Meanwhile, almost half of Ireland's rivers have unsatisfactory water quality due to high nitrate levels, which have increased by 26% since 2014.<\/p>  <p>  On our biodiversity crisis, Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea highlighted that many of our bird species are in serious decline, with 54 now on a red list and facing extinction.  Further, just 2.5% of our marine waters are designated marine protected areas.  The EU target to which we have agreed in this regard is 30%.<\/p>  <p>  On failures of governance, Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea said he was particularly concerned with the punitive cost to the public of access to justice, with anyone wishing to take an environmental case forced into the most expensive legal arena in Europe, which is the Irish High Court.  Also of deep concern to the Commission is the recent trend among developers to issue strategic lawsuit against public participation, SLAPP, suits.  These are being launched against environmental campaigners.  This manifests as wealthy developers threatening individual members of community groups with financial ruin by suing them in the High Court for defamation if they dare to challenge planning decisions.  The Government's answer to that charge, if the T&aacute;naiste's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is to be believed, is to make it even harder and more expensive for campaigners to take these cases.<\/p>  <p>  How are we expected to take the T&aacute;naiste's commitments on the environment seriously given this shameful record?  Could he confirm his intention to further butcher our planning laws and make it even harder and more expensive to take cases to protect the environment?  When will the Government publish the review of our defamation law, which for months has been sitting on the desk of the Minister for Justice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300022#U01000","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1643890200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I saw some media reports on the report in question.  I have not had a chance to read it, and it would not be fair to comment on it until I have had a chance to do so.  When I said in 2018 that Ireland was a climate laggard and our ambition was to be a climate leader, I meant that.  At the time, an NGO that scores countries on where they stand in terms of climate action and environmental commitment placed us in the lowest tier of countries.  We have now moved up slightly.  We are in the second-lowest tier.  We are certainly not a leader, but we are not in the laggard group either any more, and that is because of the work that has been done since 2019, ably led by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in this coalition.  We have a long way to go, whether it is in terms of climate action, water quality or biodiversity.  We understand that as a Government and we are working very hard on it.<\/p>  <p>  On planning, what the Government intends to do is what is set out in the programme for Government, which was supported by all three parties in government and signed up to not just by Deputies but also by ordinary members of all three parties.  That is to make sure that we have a planning process that makes decisions quickly, appropriately, and fairly.  We have a system in Ireland where, generally speaking, the planning application goes through a council, a decision is then made and people have the right of appeal and they can appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is the process.  It is not expensive for people to make an objection to the council or make an observation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Judicial reviews are only supposed to happen on a point of law.  That is the whole point of a judicial review.  It is not supposed to assess whether it is right or wrong to grant planning permission.  That is for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to decide.  Its planners are the experts.  The point of a judicial review is not to rehash the planning arguments or the rights or wrongs of a particular development, it is to double check that An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the council followed the correct procedures.  That is what a judicial review is supposed to be about.  Some people are trying to turn judicial reviews into something else.  That is manifestly wrong in my view.<\/p>  <p>  If we look at the number of planning cases that go to judicial review in Ireland compared with other countries, we can see that there is a higher percentage here.  It is easier to get something judicially reviewed in Ireland than in other countries.  That is a problem.  There may be different reasons for that.  It may be due to deficiencies in our planning laws.  If that is the case, we need to change them.  It may be because of mistakes being made by councils and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in which case we need to make sure they make fewer mistakes.  It may be the case that they do not have enough resources or expertise.  We may need to help them with that as well, but we also need to bear in mind that under our process, when a judicial review happens, a judge does not necessarily have to hear both sides of the argument before allowing a judicial review to take place.  Sometimes a judge can allow a judicial review without actually hearing what the consequences could be, and there can be consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300022#U01100","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1643890200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300022#U01200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643890200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Big investments on which I have worked very hard were nearly lost to Ireland because of the delays caused by judicial reviews.

They only had the opportunity to raise objections with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If that failed, the only course open to them was judicial review.  The fact is that more than 90% of the judicial reviews relating to SHDs were successful.  This indicates that those people were 100% correct in bringing those reviews and that the fault is not with them for bringing the reviews or for clogging up the judicial system, it is with bad planning and bad planning laws and comes down to an inability on the part of people to engage with democracy and planning decisions at local level.<\/p> <p>I note the Government has decided to do away with the strategic housing developments, SHDs, but it gave so much time and opportunity to developers to launch hundreds of in local communities.

The context in which I am raising this is the death of a young 39-year-old woman at Sligo University Hospital just over two weeks ago.  That happened because of her addiction to over-the-counter opioid-containing medication.  Her name was Laura Newell and her sad and untimely death has been reported in many newspapers.  The reason I am raising this with the T&aacute;naiste is that her sister, whom I know, wrote to me and, indeed, to all of the public representatives in the Sligo-Leitrim Constituency, and asked us to raise the issue of dependence on and addiction to over-the-counter painkillers in Ireland.  She specifically stated: &ldquo;I await your response in the hope that my family can rely on you to raise these concerns at the highest level.&rdquo;  She went on to state, &ldquo;My hope would be that legislation could be put in place that will remove the medicine from behind the counter and be available only through consultation with the GP.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  It is a long email and it is heart-breaking because it tells how the 39-year-old woman died painfully from addiction.  Her sister names the over-the-counter medication.  I will not do so here, but it is a household name.  There is nothing extraordinary about Laura Newell&rsquo;s sad story but her addiction started as a response to the need for pain medication due to undiagnosed endometriosis.  In order to try to deal with her pain, she started taking over-the-counter opioid medication.  As her sister said, the drugs she was addicted to are legal and easy to obtain.  She said that she was buying them from chemists throughout the county and further afield.  Recently, she started accessing them online from pharmacies across Ireland.  She said that these purchases are unregulated and make it easy for addicts to access opioid medicines.  There is much more in it and it is a sad email but the core of this is that her family have decided to be quite candid about her death.  As her sister said, if there is to be any sense out of her loss, it would be the prevention of any other family going through this experience.  <\/p>  <p>  In that context I am asking the T&aacute;naiste if his Government will consider two things - to review the legislation and regulation around the sale of over-the-counter painkillers containing codeine and to look at the whole issue of pain management.  It is not just enough to put regulation in place.  We must also help people to deal with the issue of pain and chronic pain, which is a very significant concern for people all over the country.  I can guarantee the T&aacute;naiste that there are people sitting here in this Chamber today who know what that is.

I will discuss this with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and will provide the Deputy with a more considered response a little bit later on.  I had a chance to read the article about Laura Newell and her family in <i>The Sligo Champion<\/i>.  I express my condolences to the family on Laura&rsquo;s loss and to her two daughters aged 18 and 15 who have been left behind.  I want also to express my thanks to the Newell family for being willing to talk about this issue as we do not talk enough about the issue of prescription drug addiction in Ireland.  It is a very real problem.  It is very sad to see that she started taking painkillers because her endometriosis had not been diagnosed.  Endometriosis is frequently not diagnosed, which is a real shame, because once diagnosed, it can be treated very successfully.  Unfortunately, that did not happen in her case.<\/p><p>Her story tells us something that all of us know which is that addiction can happen to anyone from any background or walk of life.  It is very important that we recognise that the people who suffer from addiction need help.  They should not be stigmatised or criminalised and they also need to be reassured that if they seek help, their medication will not be taken away from them, or that they will at least be given an alternative, which is very important.<\/p><p>Prescription drugs are a hidden addiction much of the time in Ireland.  Sometimes it is codeine, other times it is benzos and other drugs.  I had an opportunity over the past number of weeks to watch &ldquo;Dopesick&rdquo;.  I am not sure if Members have seen that programme but it is about the OxyContin prescription drug dose epidemic in America.  It is a different jurisdiction, a different drug and a different system but it gives a real insight into the problems that any country can have with prescription drugs where they are not properly regulated and are easily abused.  It is based on a book called <i>Empire of Pain<\/i>which I have not as yet read but it is on my reading list.  <\/p><p>On codeine, specifically, because of its potential for misuse, it is a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 1984.  Some low-dose preparations are currently available without prescription and are most commonly used in combination with other analgesics like paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief.  Less frequently, it is used as a single ingredient cough suppressant.  Low-dose preparations such as these are regulated as Schedule 5 controlled drugs.  At the moment these drugs can all be sold in pharmacies under the personal supervision of a pharmacist and are not available for self-selection.  The maximum dose of codeine in a non-prescription product is limited per the medical products regulations with the maximum daily dose authorised duration of no longer than three days.  Pack sizes are limited as well.  Codeine was a medicine that was very easily available over-the-counter in the past and it is more tightly regulated now.  Somebody going into a pharmacy looking for codeine, Solpadeine or Nurofen Plus cannot just buy it and will be asked questions by the pharmacist but, perhaps, that is not enough.  It is something that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, will want to give further examination to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300023#V00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1643890800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

A farmer who paid &euro;300 last year for a tonne, or 20 bags, of the most popular type of fertiliser will pay &euro;900 this year.  This is an astonishing increase that will leave many farmers with a nightmare decision as to how they will pay for fertiliser this year.  Experts estimate that a farmer with 100 ha will end up paying &euro;40,000 more for fertiliser this year.  In fairness, most farmers I know would not own 100 ha but most would own 50 ha so their fertiliser costs will increase by &euro;20,000.  A typical mid-sized farmer feeding 120 tonnes of rations and using 30 tonnes of fertiliser per year will see his or her fertiliser bill rising by &euro;23,400 a year.  No farmer can take this hit.  They will simply go out of business, owing co-ops throughout the country tens of thousands of euro.<\/p><p>The Government is well aware of this crisis.  In October, the Taoiseach was told on the floor of the D&aacute;il by the Rural Independent Group that this fertiliser crisis was imminent and that the Government needed to do something about it immediately.  In November, another member of our group told the Taoiseach to take action immediately.  In the past couple of weeks, we have been pleading with the Government to take action but we have heard nothing to date about what the Government have done.  The week before last at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I challenged Mr. Fabien Santini of the EU agriculture committee on solutions to this crisis.  He said that the rising price of gas was mainly to blame, as well as the fact that import levies are adding to the crisis.  However, he also stated that the government of each member state has been given latitude to provide unique farmer support through the relaxation of the state aid framework.  He further stated that this will only be available until June 2022 and would allow for financial aid.<\/p><p>Shamefully, at that same meeting, the Green Party member of the committee emphatically expressed that he wanted to broaden the issue to ask why we are so dependent on fertiliser.  He said, &quot;The reality is that these artificial fertilisers are having a devastating effect locally&quot;.  He further stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn addition, using these inputs allows us to grow more grass and have higher stocking rates in our farms.  That has a knock-on increase on the methane that we produce.  All in all, it seems to make sense to drive the organic angle ... <\/blockquote>  <p>My worry is that such deranged thinking is feeding into the mindset of the Government and is detrimental to the food chain in this country.  It is astonishing that our Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael-Green Party Government has so far failed to use the tools referred to by Mr. Santini to assist our crisis-struck farmers.  It is shameful that our Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completely failed to take action despite the crisis we are in.  Irish farming families need a strong Government at this time and a subsidy is immediately needed for farmers who purchase fertilisers, perhaps one similar to the subsidy given to farmers during the fodder crisis some years back.  Maybe I am wrong and maybe the Greens are not wagging the tail of this Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Government.  If not, what has the Government discussed at Cabinet since the Taoiseach was told of this fertiliser cost crisis, which affects tens of thousands of farmers, in October and November?  What solutions has the Government put in place to save many farmers from wipe-out this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300024#W00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1643891400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I am not at liberty to tell the Deputy what was and was not discussed at Cabinet, but I can tell him that the Government is seized of this issue.  I had an opportunity to meet with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA yesterday, alongside the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon.  It raised a lot of issues, including climate action, the Common Agricultural Policy, its concerns around the dairy forum, which I share, and the problems the pig industry is facing.  One of the matters raised was the very high price and cost of fertilisers, which in some cases have even trebled in cost.  That is an extraordinary increase for any input and it will, in turn, increase costs for farmers.  The latter can then drive up food prices, which impacts negatively on consumers.  The levels of dry farming could potentially come down as well, which we do not want to happen.<\/p>  <p>  While there are a number of factors at play in the market, there is unfortunately no sign of fertiliser prices easing in the short to medium term.  Energy prices will remain well above January 2021 levels and increased global demand continues, particularly from the big grain-producing countries.  Increased transport costs and EU-imposed tariffs on duties on certain third country imports are also adding to prices.  The information we have from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine indicates that fertiliser supplies are likely to remain tight but usage is expected to be lower over the next few months in response to higher prices.  From 2 February, Russia imposed a ban on ammonium nitrate exports for two months until 2 April.  This will place added pressure on the availability of fertiliser, particularly calcium ammonium nitrate.  The Department is continuing to monitor the situation very closely.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, launched the 2022 soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign on 26 January in response to the unprecedented rise in fertiliser prices.  As part of this campaign Teagasc has put together a comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisers with a compendium of 20 fact sheets designed to optimise the use of plant nutrients to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability.  These fact sheets cover soil testing, lime application, nitrogen use, organic manures, fertiliser spreading and many other topics that will be incredibly useful for farmers.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission is currently examining the effect on the European market of removing anti-dumping measures.  A decision on this is expected shortly.

The most he said is that farmers will get an information pack.  Farmers do not want an information pack; they want some of the kind of relief of the sort that Mr. Santini of the EU agricultural committee told us two weeks ago can be given by the Government.  We know of farmers who could not get credit and who had to pay upfront for fertiliser in November and December.  They are not able to sustain this astronomical increase in the cost of fertiliser.  The T&aacute;naiste says the Russians are the problem.  We saw what happened last week with the Russians and the fishermen.  We will have to send out a couple of farmers to resolve this issue, seeing as the fishermen were the only ones who could resolve the issue last week.  The resolution to this problem lies with the Government.  It can intervene and is failing to do so.  Please tell me the Government is going to intervene.  What interventions is it going to make in order to assist farmers?  They do not need an information package.  They are not stupid.  They are well aware of what is going on.

I acknowledge that reducing fertiliser use is not going to solve this problem.  We need to reduce the price as well.  We are, in comparison with other EU countries, a very small market when it comes to fertiliser sales.  No fertilisers are manufactured in Ireland and this results in indigenous fertiliser companies being price-takers, dependent on global supply and demand and subject to exchange rates.  The Minister is working with the European Commission on this, particularly in relation to trade defence instruments such as the imposition of duties and tariffs, which are done on a European level.  If we could get some change on that it would help bring down prices.

It is a social disaster, quite frankly, that people in their 20s and 30s who would have been able to own a home 20, 30 or 40 years ago simply cannot now.  One of the biggest challenges facing the Government is turning that around, increasing supply and putting in place schemes to enable people in their late 20s and 30s to be able to buy a home, just as they used to be able to do not that long ago.

I hope the T&aacute;naiste will provide some clarity on this remark, as it suggests to me that there may be an effort by some Ministers and their Departments to limit the proposed powers of a future democratically elected mayor in Limerick.

The legislation is progressing well, and it is intended that it would be in the House well before the summer, and hopefully enacted well before the summer.  There is no date for the mayoral election yet because obviously the legislation must be enacted first.  The intention is to have that legislation done before the summer recess.

Under the AMIF, the EU provides financial support for a comprehensive approach to the management of migration in the European Union.  As Deputies will be aware, Ireland is required to formally opt in to certain EU home affairs instruments under arrangements in place for non-Schengen member states.  This includes the new 2021-2027 AMIF programme.<\/p><p>The opt-in process requires both Government and Oireachtas approval.  I obtained Government approval at the Government meeting last week and this motion is being moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas today.  The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund is an important means of supporting some of our most vulnerable migrant communities, including refugees and asylum seekers.  It is exclusively targeted at non-EU nationals.  The funding is used both by my Department and the Department of Justice to finance a wide range of asylum, migration and integration programmes.<\/p><p>The fund was adopted by EU member states in 2021.  Its overall policy objective at the EU level is to contribute to the efficient management of migration flows and to the implementation, strengthening and development of the EU common policy on asylum and the common immigration policy.  Within this overall objective, the fund is intended to contribute to the following specific objectives: strengthening and developing all aspects of the common European asylum system, including its external dimensions; strengthening and developing legal migration to the member states in accordance with their economic and social needs, and promoting and contributing to the effective integration and social inclusion of third-country nationals; contributing to countering irregular migration, enhancing effective, safe and dignified return and readmission, and promoting and contributing to effective initial reintegration in third countries; and enhancing solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between the member states, in particular as regards those most affected by migration and asylum challenges, including through practical co-operation.<\/p><p>Under the framework of these objectives, each member state develops its own national programme setting out how it intends to use the fund at the national level in support of these objectives.  Ireland opted into the previous Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, which ran from 2014 to 2020, and to the two funds that preceded it, namely, the European Integration Fund and the European Refugee Fund.  Ireland's likely allocation under the new fund will be determined when the opt-in process is completed.  Under the previous AMIF, the State was allocated some &euro;55.5 million across the areas of asylum, integration and return.<\/p><p>Since 2016, my Department and previously the Department of Justice and Equality have used AMIF funding to support NGO-Ied migrant integration programmes, aspects of the Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP, and the returns programme operated by the Department of Justice for international protection applicants whose claims have not been successful, or who choose to return to their home country.<\/p><p>The AMIF is distributed by my Department in a number of ways in order to help Ireland meet its objectives under an agreed national programme.  Specifically, my Department administers open calls for proposals and provides grant funding to successful applicants, typically NGOs working in the area of migrant integration; provides direct awards to certain bodies that have unique ability to perform specific measures; and provides funds to assist the return of third-country nationals to their country of origin, on both a voluntary and involuntary basis, under a returns programme operated by the Department of Justice.  Under the open call process, organisations can submit proposals for programmes and projects to address the asylum and integration objectives of the national programme.<\/p><p>The first open call process under the previous AMIF took place in 2016 and following an assessment process 20 projects nationwide were awarded grants totalling &euro;4.5 million.  A second open call process was run in 2019 where a further &euro;4.5 million was distributed to 19 successful organisations.  Subject to completion of the opt-in to the 2021-2027 AMIF programme, it is intended that my Department will run another open call for proposals later in 2022, once a national programme for the new fund has been developed.<\/p><p>The range of projects funded under AMIF is broad.  For example, under the open calls process for AMIF 2014-2020, Gaisce was funded to provide an opportunity for young asylum seekers, refugees and third country nationals to achieve a Gaisce award by improving personal and physical skills and undertaking community involvement, team challenges and an &quot;adventure journey&quot;.  There are many benefits for this group in completing Gaisce awards, including improved confidence and well-being, and positive mental health and social inclusion, which are especially important given the difficult circumstances these young people may have encountered.<\/p><p>Another type of project funded under AMIF is run by Spirasi, which works to ensure that victims of torture receive the supports they need to support healing and recovery.  They are offered educational and psychosocial supports to enable their integration into normal life after traumatic episodes of torture.  These are just a small sample representative of the many worthwhile projects funded under the 2014-2020 programme.<\/p><p>Under the 2014-2020 programme, three direct awards totalling &euro;3.9 million have been granted to the Irish refugee protection programme, which is operated by my Department to resettlement work.  The funding has supported selection missions to Lebanon, transport for beneficiaries and the integration of beneficiaries here in Ireland.  In 2019, the HSE received a direct award of &euro;990,000 to fund the Safetynet project.  This is a mobile health screening service which visits direct provision centres to provide medical screening to asylum seekers.<\/p><p>Under AMIF rules, my Department has also availed of a technical assistance budget of &euro;2.56 million from Ireland's allocation.  This supports the funds administration unit in my Department to effectively administer the AMIF funds in Ireland.  Technical assistance will also be available under the new fund.<\/p><p>Each participating member state must produce a national programme setting out its objectives and plans for how the funding will be deployed.<\/p> <p>National programmes are normally drafted following consultation with relevant interests in the State, including NGOs, as well as with the European Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the fund's administration.  Subject to approval for the opt-in, my Department will lead the development of a national programme for Ireland for the next set of funding.  This new national programme will cover the main areas of the fund, namely asylum; legal migration; integration; resettlement; countering irregular migration; returns; and solidarity measures.<\/p> <p> In developing the new national programme, my Department will consult with stakeholders in the areas of asylum, migration and integration, including relevant NGOs and  Departments, to include the Department of Justice, which will continue to manage funded activities in the areas of migration and return.  Members will all be aware of the extensive work under way in my Department to implement the White Paper to end direct provision, which I published almost one year ago.  This is a priority area for the Government as we seek to replace the direct provision system with a new model that is better able to support the independence, autonomy and right to family life of asylum seekers.<\/p> <p> Respect for human rights, early integration, and partnership with the not-for-profit sector are essential principles of the new model we are now putting in place.  Work is progressing well in my Department and across the Government to implement the policy changes set out in the White Paper.  While there remains much preparatory work to be done, at our current rate of progress we anticipate that the first moves from direct provision centres into the new independent accommodation provided under the new model will commence later this year.  In developing the new programme AMIF, we will ensure it provides opportunities for AMIF funding to support these reforms.  Subject to Oireachtas approval of the opt-in, the relevant EU bodies will be informed and work on the national programme can begin.  I commend the motion to the House and seek Members' support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300029#EE00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643894700,"counter":383,"content":"<p>This is an important debate and we are glad to be engaged in it because the fund and the initiatives and policies for which it provides money are important and deserve debate.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a number of matters.  The first relates to EU migration policy as a whole.  We face a migration crisis brought by war, climate change and systematic discrimination, especially in Africa and the Middle East.  The easiest thing to do - it is, unfortunately, the path some other EU member states and institutions wish to take - is to pull up the drawbridge and to treat this as not our problem and not to concern ourselves with it.  The shredding of international law related to refugee and asylum matters that comprises much of EU policy was opposed by Sinn F&eacute;in through our representatives in the European Parliament, but these changes seem to be progressing nonetheless, to be implemented in a number of other ways.<\/p><p>One of the more notable examples is the EURODAC database, which records and stores the fingerprints of migrants for the EU in order to implement the Dublin protocol.  Last year a proposal was brought which would see the minimum age for recording of fingerprints on the database brought down from 14 years of age to only six years of age.  While this obscenity was done to prevent child trafficking, the implications of this amount of surveillance on minors cannot be ignored.  A humane migration policy cannot be built on violating the human rights of those who are fleeing prosecution.  Although EURODAC comes under the Department of Justice's purview, it is important to raise and discuss it when discussing EU funding for these matters because it crosses many Departments.  The EU also has to grapple increasingly with the urgent need for further programmes of refugee acceptance, which we have seen with regard to Syria and, more recently, in Afghanistan.  Those who worked in EU institutions and for America in Afghanistan cannot be left at the mercy of the situation there.  While other rescue missions might be difficult, the State should look to accept as many as is practical to come into this country.<\/p><p>Turning to matters specifically under the Department's responsibility, the goal of integration is, of course, an important one, and the fund and the programme that encourages it should enjoy support.  However, the material basis of society is what aids integration the most.  Where people are pitted against one another for resources and where austerity often prevails, racism will find a more welcoming environment.  Integration programmes will not work if housing or healthcare policy is not working.  All of these things have to be doing their job.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have policies in those areas, which everyone is aware of.<\/p><p>Housing, in particular, will be key to ending direct provision, which, to the Minister's credit, she has made a priority.  It is worth putting on record what the Government's White Paper has stated on the matter of accommodation as it was released last year.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t- Houses and\/or apartments will be built and\/or acquired through approved housing bodies or equivalent organisations.  This option will be used for families and single people, particularly vulnerable single people.<br \/><br \/>- Buildings will be repurposed through urban renewal initiatives to create accommodation for single people.<br \/><br \/>- Rent a room schemes will be used to source some of the accommodation for single people.<br \/><br \/>- Private tenancies will be used to source accommodation for families as necessary. <\/blockquote>  <p>It should be noted that the latter two of these four options explicitly rely on the private rental market.  While we are all heartened by the stories of people accepting Syrian refugees into their homes, it is not a long-term policy solution, and rent-a-rooms comprise part of the private rental market, meaning they offer poor protection to tenants where there is inflation of prices.  The last option is unambiguously focused on private rental, which echoes the Government's failed HAP policies, and recent responses to parliamentary questions do not fill me with confidence as they mention the acquisition of turn-key properties.  In and of itself this is not an issue, but there are now multiple agencies bidding against one another and this has the potential to cause further inflation and to condemn refugees to possibly lower standards of end accommodation.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in was clear that the investment into approved housing bodies options was key, especially if purpose-built accommodation is to be constructed.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, in a recent paper about the true level of homelessness in this country, revealed that there were 1,640 people who had received leave to remain but were still living in direct provision.  The reason for this is very simple: there is nowhere else for them to go due to the shortage of housing.  Refugees are particularly vulnerable to discrimination within the private rental market, and I think the Minister is aware of that.  Accommodation needs to be provided on a non-profit basis.  That is really important.  I call on the Minister to start publishing a pipeline report for accommodation to be provided under her Department.  Of course, this fund will provide money for that.  The report should say what accommodation is forthcoming and by what means it is to be built or acquired.  This is incredibly important as it is the stated aim of the Government to essentially clear out the current system before new applicants are brought into the reform system.  If we are to clear out the direct provision system now, obviously there will have to be space to put these people.  That is the real issue.  The inclusion of asylum seekers as part of the undocumented scheme, which I was surprised to see, when the Minister could have just provided leave to remain for these people instead, clearly seems to be part of that policy.  Direct provision must be ended humanely.  A fudge, where the private rental market would have to provide the accommodation for nearly 9,000 extra people, is simply not going to work and is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300030#FF00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1643894700,"counter":384,"content":"<p>The Labour Party supports Ireland's opt-in to the 2021-2027 asylum, migration and integration fund.  We take issue, however, with some of the on-the-ground reality within the European Union towards refugees.  Statistics released by the Greek Government and confirmed by the UNHCR set the total number of arrivals to Greece in 2021 at 8,000, of which roughly half arrived by sea.  The Greek ministry for maritime affairs, however, reports more than 29,000 rescues by the Hellenic Coast Guard in the same period, with just 25,000 people remaining unaccounted for.  The reality of the EU's hostility towards migrants and asylum seekers was brought into sharp focus when Irish citizen, Se&aacute;n Binder, was arrested and charged for crimes carrying up to a 25-year sentence for joining other activists and NGO workers in rescuing African migrants who had got into difficulty in the Aegean Sea.  There is a clear issue within the European Union with pushbacks and with migration and integration in practice.  Each one of these figures is a human life, yet there are ministers in European governments parroting that it is positive to have low migration flows into Europe.  This is true only if refugees are not fleeing; it is an overwhelming negative if refugees are seeking asylum but numbers remain low or decrease.  It means that Europe is an unwelcome place that does not believe that desperate people deserve refuge.  Ireland is not an outlier in this regard and we must do far more before we can accuse others of not pulling their weight.<\/p>  <p>  We in the Labour Party welcome the regularisation programme for undocumented people living in Ireland announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, this week.  We also welcome the parallel programme being opened for people in Ireland's asylum system.  Regarding the regularisation scheme, however, my colleague, Senator Bacik, has been critical of the decision to discount time spent in the asylum system when calculating an applicant's time spent living in Ireland.  Many people will find they are eligible for neither scheme as a result.<\/p> <p>We in Labour see this as punishing people for being trapped in a system which this State has acknowledged is inefficient.  While the scheme is welcome and is a tribute to the work of the Green Party in government, it could have been much more generous.  Last year my colleague Deputy Duncan Smith questioned the Department of Justice regarding the status of refugees and asylum seekers in direct provision and raised the potential for an amnesty to give these applicants citizenship in order to alleviate many of the very serious issues they face and enable those people to find and obtain accommodation where they could live safely during this unprecedented pandemic.  We cannot allow human beings to be treated as lesser people.  We must completely overhaul our asylum system and we must grant a citizenship amnesty to all asylum seekers and refugees currently resident in Ireland.  We must treat all people of Ireland with dignity and respect.<br\/><br\/>I support the programme announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and any such move is definitely progress.  Why could this program not be broadened to capture more people who are living and working in Ireland in circumstances of great uncertainty?  Someone who is living here, working here, paying tax here and contributing to Irish society belongs here.  They are one of us; they are us.  The country of c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte has a long way to go to live up to that ethos and it begins with conversations like this.  When we see these positive moves, why do we need to ask why it is limited?<br\/><br\/>Every week I deal with people who are in these exact scenarios.  They work in our communities and contribute to our society.  Their kids play on our sports teams and are involved in local community groups.  We are all richer for them.  We must show basic reality and humanity and be sure we never tell somebody they do not belong.<br\/><br\/>I draw the Minister's attention to a piece published in the <i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>this week from Shamim Malekmian.  Her piece highlights the ongoing failure to provide long-promised immigration detention centres.  In 2021 people who were refused entry to Ireland at our borders were forced to await deportation in prisons.  There is sparse information on the numbers of people who are detained in prison for this reason because data are not collected in the absence of a dedicated immigration detention facility.  Such a facility was to have been opened in 2020.  It is inhumane to detain people in Garda stations and prisons.<br\/><br\/>Another EU directive, the return directive to which Ireland is not a signatory, requires that immigration detention must take place in a specialised facility and that all those detained should have access to legal experts and free legal aid.  This is not currently in place.  People detained include those seeking asylum.  Seeking asylum is not a crime.  It is a fundamental human right to be respected by states.  Ireland should move immediately to correct this alarming situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300030#FF00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643895300,"counter":386,"content":"<p>The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund is a mechanism to address issues relating to the lack of integration and diversity in sectors of Irish society.  While we pride ourselves on being welcoming people, the reality can be very different for migrants and people of colour who experience anything from microaggression to racially motivated attacks.  The recent incident of performers from \"The Lion King\" musical being subjected to racial abuse in Dublin is just one of many examples we could draw on.  The State needs to direct its resources to ensure greater equality and integration.  The Government still claims that 2024 is the target for ending direct provision, but the slow pace does not indicate to those trapped in the system that this will be achieved.  We still have entire families in congregated settings often separated from the local communities, with integration being left to very dedicated local volunteers and the good faith of schools, doctors and community organisations.<\/p>  <p>  When I raised this issue last July, the Minister assured me that families and children are being moved to independent living accommodation, which is most welcome.  However, he neglected to mention that families may be moved considerable distances.  In one case, a family was moved from Cork to Donegal, ignoring the children's integration in their schools or the support network the family had built up over years in the area.  The International Protection Accommodation Service is trying to solve one problem while creating a whole new set of issues.  Where is the consideration of the people involved?  If integration is the goal, why is it not taken seriously in making these decisions?<\/p>  <p>  Gender-based violence has rightly been a major focus recently.  Migrant girls and women are disproportionately represented in statistics.  They are particularly vulnerable due to different factors such as their migration status, ability to speak English and the type of work in which they are predominantly employed.  Shortly before Christmas, representatives of the Migrants Rights Centre Ireland presented to the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  They pointed out that migrant women continue to experience barriers in exiting situations of domestic violence and accessing support services.  Women are fearful because their status is linked to a partner's entitlement to retain immigration status following a separation from a partner.  While there have been some limited measures to address this, we need proper reform in this area.<\/p>  <p>  These situations raise the question about how the immigration system makes migrants more vulnerable.  For example, undocumented people often do not access services or report crimes for fear it will result in their deportation.  The scheme to regularise undocumented people is an important development, but we need guarantees or a firewall approach that prevents information being passed from, for example, the Department of Social Protection to the Department of Health, or from the Department of Health to the immigration office.<\/p>  <p>  Stable diverse communities are an essential pillar of integration.  For the most part it happens naturally in neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces.  For this to happen we need accessible and affordable housing.  Migrants and minorities are over-represented in homelessness figures.  We need a whole-of-government approach to integration to understand these interconnected issues.  These are just some examples.  Migrants, people of colour, Travellers and others experience discrimination in different ways every day.  Some of these barriers are a matter of policy and need to be changed.  Others relate to interventions around training and support, which can be paid for by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.<\/p>  <p>  However, the fund is also used for return management and countering irregular migration.  Many Irish people are deeply uncomfortable with the reality behind these phrases.  Migrants drowning in the Mediterranean and deaths in south-east Europe, especially in winter, such as the case of 12 migrants who froze to death near Turkey's border with Greece this week, represent a failure to understand and respond adequately to the situation.  These aspects of the fund are very concerning and need greater scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  We need to push for the progressive use of the fund, not putting the lives of migrants at risk.  The previous Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund was used to support organisations working in the area, including, Nasc, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, and in Cork city Gaisce and Cork ETB.  There was also investment in schemes providing employment readiness training and diversity training in schools.  We need to use the current fund to further this type of work and to foster the type of Ireland the vast majority of Irish people want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300031#GG00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1643895300,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The next five-minute slot is for People Before Profit, as l&aacute;thair.

It is interesting to read the regulations from the EU governing this fund.  As I read the document, I wondered what the real intention of it was.  It seems clear to me that it is to stop immigration to the EU from war-torn and economically fragile African and Middle Eastern countries.  Paragraph 9 states that given that certain actions taken outside the Union contribute to the achievement of the fund's objectives under certain circumstances it may bring the Union added value, which means stopping people getting here so we will not have to deal with them.<\/p>  <p>  The fund should support the strengthening of partnerships with third countries for the purpose of managing migration.  We can take this as meaning countries such as Libya which are totally dysfunctional thanks to military action taken by France and the UK on behalf of oil companies in our name in years gone by.  The EU is happy for migrants to be pushed back to countries where there is no functioning government and placed in camps and prisons with untold danger for them simply because they wanted a better life for themselves and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The regulation also states that the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration in all actions or decisions concerning children in migration.  I ask the Minister in his summing up to explain how that will be achieved by this regulation.  What role will countries like Libya play in partnership with us in ensuring that the best interests of the child are taken care of?  It is sickening to say \"in partnership with us\" about the dysfunctional Libyan Government, but it is now one of our partners because of this document and the implications of this work.<\/p>  <p>  I could go on to say more about this policy, but time is of the essence.  I know this is about the adoption of specific regulations here in Ireland, but it is part of the overall European document which we obviously had a role in drafting.<\/p> <p>These are important issues that affect how the process for asylum seekers will be implemented in Ireland and that needs to be addressed too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300031#GG00700","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643895900,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I will reluctantly support the motion.  The fund is very positive, although I have the greatest reservations about the regulation on which it is based and, like my colleague, about the theory behind it.  It seems to be the building-up of a fortress Europe while giving a little money this way to calm the masses and dissent.  In that context, I will support it.<\/p>  <p>  I have a number of questions about the fund.  This is our third time getting it.  How was the money broken down on the previous occasion?  I have some concern also about the money being used for the return of people to other countries.  I would love to see the breakdown of that if one exists.  I could not see it but that might be my fault.<\/p>  <p>  The undocumented scheme is very positive.  It was developed as a result of organisations on the ground pointing out the necessity for it.  The Minister acted on that, and I am delighted.  Nevertheless, there seem to be two parallel processes in being.  Those under the undocumented scheme will get a stamp 4 visa after having been here for two years, and there is also the group of asylum seekers.  Those under the undocumented scheme can come forward and apply, whereas for asylum seekers, it rests with the Department of Justice to come forward and tell people who are resident in the various institutions.  There are two such places in Galway.  The power, therefore, does not rest with those seeking benefit under this.  The Minister might clarify that, as well as whether the six-month supply exists for asylum seekers living in those institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister might clarify also the contradiction in the Catherine Day report.  Those under the asylum seeker process must wait for the Department of Justice to come forward, at which point they can get their stamp 4 visa for two years.  The report of the Catherine Day advisory group called for a once-off simplified case-processing approach applying to all applicants who have been in the system for two years or more.  It recommended they get five years.  There are so many different recommendations and systems that run parallel here that it is utterly confusing.  We put great store in the Catherine Day report, and the only difficulty I had related to the proposal for housing, as Deputy Martin Kenny outlined, and the reliance on the private market, which was always going to be a disaster.  Other than that, Catherine Day and the report have got unanimous support and praise.<\/p>  <p>  The case-processing approach was one of the strong recommendations in the report, and there was also a recommendation to address the practical problems such as the cost of applying and so on.  In addition, other groups have been excluded from the scheme.  I do not expect one scheme to sort out all the problems, but it is important that the Department would conduct an analysis of those affected by exclusion.  We are looking after one group, of approximately 17,000, including 3,000 children, but we are excluding other groups, such as people who have lost their status under non-EU rules.  Such persons, if they are married to someone in the EU, are no longer able to get what they used to.  Different groups are always excluded and there is an onus on the Department to analyse that.  When there is one positive outcome, the Department must ask what the problems with that are.  I will stop there because I am out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300032#HH00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1643895900,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  To respond to Deputy Connolly on the breakdown, under the 2014-2020 scheme, Ireland had &euro;55.5 million allocated.  I have to hand a copy of the percentages for each of the areas.  A total of 30% of the national allocation was spent on asylum, 32% on integration, 22% on return, 5.8% on solidarity and 10% on technical assistance.  Under the regulations, that was the requirement for Ireland.  Many of the groups she and other Deputies spoke about received their funding allocation coming from those.  In my opening remarks, I highlighted a couple of the really good projects that have been financed over the past six years.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies spoke with accuracy in regard to the issues with large-scale EU migration and the EU's approach to migration.  It is important to recognise what Ireland has done as a country over recent years and particularly during Covid to recognise the crises that exist in regard to our ongoing support for Syrian refugees coming to this country through the IRPP.  Just over 550 Syrian refugees came to Ireland in 2021.  I had the privilege, and the difficult task, of visiting a Syrian refugee camp in November of last year and saw the conditions in which Syrians have been living there for almost a decade following the civil war.  I met Syrians who will be moving to Ireland and starting a new life here and spoke to members of the Jordanian Government, which has done a great deal to offer support.  Approximately 20% of the Jordanian population now comprises Syrian refugees, and they are given the same level of social supports and of access to Covid vaccines.  I was very impressed with Jordan's support for and solidarity with its neighbours.<\/p>  <p>  We also acted swiftly in the context of Afghanistan.  A total of 550 emergency visas have been offered to Afghan citizens.  More than 400 Afghans have already come to this country and, again, many throughout the country are being supported through the community sponsorship programme.  We fulfilled our commitment towards unaccompanied minors, 28 of whom we received from Lesbos in the latter part of last year.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about the White Paper and our moves to discuss accommodation.  As Deputy Connolly highlighted, the Catherine Day report is a fantastic document, but it recommended going down the HAP route.  It indicated HAP should be the majority way in which provision for asylum seekers, while they await that determination, is met.  We disagreed with that, which is why, in the White Paper, HAP is not the central focus.  Rather, the central focus relates to build and purchase.  That is what we are committed to doing and it is what we are working on, but we have to recognise we are creating a long-term system that will have ebbs and flows, and we have to build flexibility into it.  At some point, some of that flexibility may involve HAP or other methods, but the central part of what we are doing relates to build and buy, in a way that does not conflict with the activities of local authorities.  That is why we have worked closely with the Housing Agency and some of those larger bodies, particularly for single accommodation.  We are not competing with families for the likes of a three-bed semi-detached house, given we are looking for something different, at least in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the support for the regularisation scheme, a very important scheme.  I disagree with what was said about it being restrictive.  It is a very broad approach.  Other than a recognition that people have to have been living in the country for a period, namely, three years if they have children or four if they do not, it is a very broad approach for dealing with undocumented people and it is designed to bring people out of the shadows and into being registered and regularised in order that they can fully enjoy all the rights and protections everyone else does.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome also the provision for people in international protection and direct provision at the moment.  The Department of Justice will notify those who have been in the international protection application process for more than two years as to whether they are eligible for the scheme.  A period of two years is the cut-off point of eligibility for the scheme.  Obviously, it is then up to the individual.  He or she can decide to apply for the regularisation scheme or, of course, continue on his or her existing international protection application.  We are making that as flexible as possible, recognising that people have a right to apply for international protection.  No one will be forced to apply under the regularisation scheme but it is an option for them.  Particularly in the case of people who have been in the system for a long period, perhaps having gone through judicial reviews and the like or having lived in limbo for many years, this offers an opportunity to allow them to establish a status for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the House's support for the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300032#HH00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643895900,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1643896500,"counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300033#JJ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1643896500,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time\".<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased to introduce the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill today.  The T&aacute;naiste was very anxious that we get the legislation in place.  I thank all involved in the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, process who have been working on it for the last year and everyone who was involved in my Department and in the Department of Social Protection.  I want to single out Ms Clare Dunne, an assistant secretary general who retired before Christmas.  She was instrumental in making sure this legislation, among many other pieces of legislation, were brought through the Houses.  I want to recognise her work and retirement.  I want to thank Dara Breathnach for her assistance here today.  I am conscious that many colleagues across the House will have raised this as an issue that needed to be dealt with in a timely manner.  The Bill reflects the concerns that most people have raised with us in the last year.<\/p>  <p>  This short and technical Bill will resolve an issue arising for some employees who were laid off during the period of greatest Covid-19 related restrictions or who may be laid off over the next three-year period.  The T&aacute;naiste was clear that this had to be dealt with and clearly so this Bill sets out to do that.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has provided an extensive range of supports for businesses and employees affected by sometimes prolonged closures during the pandemic.  We have made every effort, with significant cross-party support, to assist workers and employers.  We have provided the pandemic unemployment payment to workers who were laid off.  We have supported businesses in maintaining the employer-employee relationship, first through the TWSS and then the EWSS.  When restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened, we have supported them by providing extensive sector-specific guidance and reopening grants.  While we all recognise that these supports go a long way to help maintain businesses and jobs we do recognise that no matter what supports we put in place, they cannot replace all the lost revenue and all the grief and hassle that businesses and employees have gone through over the last two years.  I want to recognise again the efforts by all those in the work environment, employers and employees, who went to great lengths to try to provide services and reach their customers and maintain business as much as they possibly could during Covid and who did follow all the procedures set out by the Government and the Department of Health in trying to protect themselves, their employees and their customers from the virus.  That came at a great cost to businesses and I want to recognise that.<\/p>  <p>  Despite a difficult few weeks after the arrival of the Omicron variant, the results are clear.  Many sectors of the economy have bounced back remarkably quickly.  Our public finances are in a far better position than we could have reasonably expected last summer, although they are still under pressure and we have had high costs to deal with Covid.  However, conditions are certainly improving.  Government supports have played their part, but most of all this is a credit to the resilience of businesses and workers, especially in our domestic SME sector.  Omicron was a setback.  The number of people in receipt of PUP increased from 55,000 at the end November, to almost 67,000 in early January.  This was an inevitable result of the new precautions to reduce the spread of Omicron when the scientific information was not available to tell us how serious it would be.  However, we should put this in context.  The highest-ever number of people on PUP was more than 600,000 back in May 2020.  The highest number last year, back in February, was more than 486,000.  The reduction in PUP claimants late last year was not just because the payment level was being tapered off but was mainly because of people returning to employment.  The most recent figures available show that in quarter 3 of last year we had the largest number of people ever in employment, at more than 2.47 million people.  As we move in the coming days and weeks to ease the Omicron precautions and back towards full reopening, we have good reason to be optimistic for recovery.<\/p>  <p>  However, we acknowledge that the recovery will not be universal and sustained over all businesses in all sectors.  Some businesses will not resume with their previous capacity.  Some may fail entirely.  Some of this is simply a normal part of the economic cycle but some will be the result of the fall-out from Covid over the past two years.  Whether it happens as part of the normal economic cycle or because of the pandemic, business downsizing or closure usually leads to redundancies.  This takes me to the point of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As it stands, a person who qualifies for redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts is generally entitled to two weeks pay per year of service, plus a week extra.  This statutory entitlement is capped at pay up to &euro;600 per week.  This is known as statutory redundancy, and is the minimum owed to the employee by the employer.  Periods spent on short time imposed by the employer are counted as normal service for these purposes, and do not reduce the amount owed to the employee.  However, and here is why this Bill is needed, periods spent on lay-off within the final three years of an employee&rsquo;s service do not count as reckonable service for the purposes of statutory redundancy payments.  This means that a person who was laid off because of the essential Covid-19 related restrictions will not have that period counted as reckonable service if they are made redundant within three years of the end of the emergency period.  This Bill addresses that issue.  It strikes a careful balance.  We could simply deem the period to be reckonable service, but that would make the employer liable for the redundancy payment in the first instance.  That would not be fair, as the Covid restrictions were completely outside employers&rsquo; control.  We have had legal advice that explained that not only was it unfair, it would not be correct legally either.  Furthermore, making an employer liable could potentially risk their viability.  Everyone across the Houses wants to support businesses to support those jobs, not jeopardise them.  If we do not support businesses and put too much pressure on them, the knock-on effect can be job losses.  Instead, we provide for a payment by the State to the employee.  This will be known as the Covid-19 related lay-off payment.  The payment will cover the difference between the statutory redundancy payment due to the employee, and the amount to which they would have been entitled had they not been laid off due to public health restrictions during the emergency period.  The \"emergency period\" is the period from 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2021, inclusive.  This is the period during which restrictions were at their greatest.<\/p>  <p>  Employees were also restricted from invoking their normal right to trigger a redundancy to help preserve the employer-employee relationship.  That right was restored from 1 October 2021.  The criteria for accessing the Covid-19-related lay-off payment will be first, that the employee qualifies for redundancy; second, that the employee was laid off due to Covid-19 restrictions for a period or periods between 13 March 2020 and 30 September 2021; and finally, that the employee is made redundant before 30 September 2024. <\/p>  <p>  There is an in-built sunset clause in the legislation by virtue of the fact that only periods of lay-off in the final three years of employment are disregarded as reckonable service.  That is why the date of 30 September 2024 has been selected.  <\/p>  <p>The Department of Social Protection will administer the payment scheme on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, as the funds will be coming through the Social Insurance Fund.  I want to thank the officials in both Departments for their work on their work on this over the last 18 months or so and all those who fed into the conversation.  I recognise that employers and unions were anxious that this was resolved.  In the early stages of restrictions, when section 12A kicked in, no one expected that the emergency would continue for as long as it did.  We probably all assumed that it would be temporary and that it would not arise as an issue.<\/p>  <p>  They are at an advanced stage in the development and resourcing of the necessary systems.  I would like to take the opportunity to thank them and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for the tremendous work they have put into this.  They hope to have that system up and running in quarter 2 so that they can administer payments from there.  The scheme will be employer-led in the first instance.  This should not be onerous for them as many employers are already very familiar with Department of Social Protection processes.  There will also be provision for an employee to make direct application if, for whatever reason, their employer fails or refuses to do so.  This includes, for example, where an employer may already have closed permanently.  There have been some casualties over the last two years already from the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  We expect that payments should be able to commence in the first half of this year, after the passage and commencement of this Bill.  It is very difficult to say what the costs of this will be, as they will be demand driven.  We will not see the full picture until September 2024.  Hopefully, the numbers will be much less than what any of us would have feared at the start.<\/p>  <p>  As I noted at the outset, our businesses and employees have shown themselves to be remarkably resilient in the face of a very challenging period.  We have many reasons for optimism that suggest the costs should be manageable.<\/p> <p>Initial funding of &euro;10 million has been allocated for 2022.  However, the costs will be demand-driven, and funding will be available to match the drawdown.  The Department of Social Protection and my Department will monitor the position carefully as applications come in.<\/p> <p> This Bill is short and technical but it will make a clear and positive difference to people's lives.  It acknowledges and compensates for reckonable service that employees have been unable to accrue due to pandemic closures.  It protects businesses from additional costs as they strive to regain their footing in a still-difficult environment.  It is business and worker friendly and recognises the tremendous impact of Covid-19 restrictions on everybody concerned.<\/p> <p> I intend to amend the Bill on Committee Stage or Report Stage to correct a cross-referencing error in the recently enacted Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021.  The Government will be asked to agree to that amendment.  The relevant provision has not yet been commenced.  I would like to use the early opportunity presented by the Bill to make the necessary minor amendment.  I will talk to Members when I have the wording for them.<\/p> <p> I look forward to Deputies' contributions on this Bill.  I thank Deputy O'Reilly and others who have contributed to the conversation on this challenge over the past two years as we have tried to find the best way to deal with the issue arising from the temporary lay-offs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300033#JJ00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643897100,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with my colleagues.  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  It involves a short but important piece of work, which we in Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting.<\/p>  <p>  The Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill is a specific response to decisions taken at the beginning of the pandemic whereby section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act was suspended.  This was done to protect workers from being made redundant.  Employers were also protected in that they would not have a deluge of workers applying for redundancy payments.  However, with this decision several technical difficulties arose for workers, specifically workers laid off or on short time, such as those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  The Minister of State will know this because he and I have spoken about it on more than one occasion.  Some of the workers were concerned that they would not have the fair calculation of reckonable service if they were unfortunate enough to be made redundant, and as a result they were genuinely afraid that they would then lose out on significant sums of money regarding a redundancy claim.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the trade union movement in general spotted this very early on in the pandemic.  I myself introduced a Bill last March, the Redundancy Payments (Lay off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill 2021, the aim of which was similar to that of the Bill before the House, namely, to ensure workers would not lose out on time when it came to the calculation of a redundancy entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before us is very welcome.  It was dealt with by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year.  Many concerns were cleared up by the departmental officials in attendance, whom I thank for their time and patience on the day.  I was not at the meeting myself because I was isolating with Covid, but I followed the proceedings online.  My colleague, Senator Paul Gavan, had queries answered on the occasion.<\/p>  <p>  The main aim of this Bill is to provide for a once-off redundancy payment to workers in respect of certain lay-off periods during the period beginning on 13 March and ending at the end of September 2021.  Under the Redundancy Payments Act, statutory redundancy is based on duration of service and a qualified employee is entitled to two weeks' pay per year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a cap of &euro;600 in earnings per week, payable by the employer.  Under the existing Act, periods of lay-off in the final three years of service do not count as reckonable service, meaning that redundancy entitlements will not factor in those periods.  Therefore, that would result in a loss in regard to redundancy payments.  Thankfully, that is addressed within the Bill.  It ensures affected workers can access a tax-free State payment of up to &euro;1,860, financed by the Social Insurance Fund, to compensate for the break in their service caused by the pandemic and associated public-health restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  There are some additional issues I would like to raise with the Minister of State and that I hope can be addressed in the future.  I introduced the Redundancy Payments (Lay off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill 2021.  This Bill went further than addressing the fair calculation of reckonable service alone; it sought to clarify some workers' rights issues that had arisen.  One such issue concerned where an employer tried to hoodwink a worker and have them declare themselves as having resigned, thereby involuntarily forgoing their entitlement to a redundancy payment.  I spoke to several workers - many of them women and migrant workers - who outlined how unscrupulous employers tried to con them into making themselves redundant by telling them they could resign, unbeknownst to them against their wishes.  This would have resulted in the workers losing out on any redundancy entitlement.  Perhaps the Minister of State could look into making it an offence for an employer to treat an employee as having resigned, thereby forgoing his or her redundancy entitlement, where he or she did not mean to resign.  It has happened on several occasions that people felt they had no choice but to resign.  In fact, it would be a redundancy situation in many instances.  The employers were evading their responsibility.  I am not referring to all employers and it is not a massive issue, but it is certainly an issue for the people who have contacted me, who are predominantly women and migrant workers,<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise some operational matters with the Minister of State.  The scheme cannot be launched until the legislation has made its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am aware that the Department of Social Protection will deliver the scheme.  It is establishing the necessary application system.  Has the relevant information technology work been concluded?  Will the system be ready to go live soon?  Could we be given a date for when it is expected to go live?  I ask because several workers who have been in contact with me are very anxious to know when it will happen, as the Minister of State can imagine.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said throughout, I will work with the Minister to get this legislation over the line as efficiently and effectively as possible, given that the application process is largely intended to be employer led in circumstances where employers have had to make people redundant over the course of the pandemic or will have to make them redundant in the coming years.  I know this is expected to become part of the termination process, but, as regards the provision in the legislation for a worker to make an application to the Minister where an employer has refused to make an application for him or her, how is this going to work in practice?  Will it be the same as always or will there be a separate line or a set of forms to be filled out?<\/p>  <p>  The legislation states that an application is to be made in a manner to be determined by the Minister.  Will it be directly up to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, or will it be up to the Minister for Social Protection?  Will it fall between two stools such that it will not be anyone's responsibility?  It would be helpful if the Minister of State could clarify whether the application will be online or paper based and how it will work in practice?  The details on that would be very helpful.<\/p>  <p>  We will support this legislation.  It contains many of the aims and aspirations of the legislation I introduced myself.  I will be happy to work with the Minister of State to get it through the Houses as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300034#KK00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1643897100,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I too am happy to speak on this Bill and to say Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting it.  Being made redundant can be one of the most traumatic experiences in a person's life.  It can be especially difficult if it occurs all of a sudden, if the employee has been a long time in the job or sector and if the employee has huge commitments, such as rent, mortgage or family commitments.  An older worker may find it very hard to get another job.  The redundant person wonders whether he or she will get another job with equal or better pay or any decent job at all that reflects his or her skills and experience in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill deals with a time of particular trauma for workers and small local employers, including the family businesses on which our economy is broadly built.  In north Kildare, workers and small businesses were extremely worried about what lay ahead.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in set out immediately to help them.  This Bill deals with matters under the Redundancy Payments Act to allow for a once-off redundancy payment to workers with regard to certain lay-off periods from 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2021.  It is fair to say that, on New Year's Eve 2019, nobody could have imagined that the whole of Europe would be in lockdown within three months.  The Covid lay-offs were extremely worrying.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, we immediately recognised a legislative issue and proposed our own legislation to protect workers and employers and counteract any difficulty, as my colleague Deputy Louise O'Reilly has already outlined.  I am very glad to see this Bill closes the loophole whereby newly redundant workers would lose out on reckonable service while laid off due to public-health restrictions.  This was a big worry for many workers in north Kildare.  We were very anxious to reassure them that we would do what we could to protect them.  We were approached by several workers who told us about employers who were trying to force them into redundancy on the sly or against their wishes.  They were worried about their reckonable service.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill makes sure that one can access the special tax-free State payment of up to a maximum of &euro;1,860, which is financed through the Social Insurance Fund.  While this is quite a short Bill, it is a really important one in that it looks after workers who have sacrificed so much during this pandemic, especially those who had to sacrifice their jobs.<\/p> <p>We are happy to support the Bill.

I thank Deputy O'Reilly of Sinn F&eacute;in, who brought a similar Bill forward on 18 March last year.  Many hundreds of thousands of workers have faced a terrible time during the pandemic, especially during the periods when most businesses were ordered by the Government to shut down their operations.  This caused enormous stress for workers.  It is to be hoped this Bill will ensure that no workers will lose out through no fault of their own.  I also welcome that the payment will be set at &euro;1,860, as per the legislation on redundancy payments.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise a point about the employers.  I am concerned that the taxpayer will be picking up the entire cost of the redundancies, with a possible bill of up to &euro;150 million.  This is at the higher end of the estimates, but we will have to make provision for such sums of money.  The paragraph on this in Oireachtas Library and Research Service resource on the Bill states, \"The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment received legal advice to the effect that imposing the cost of the lay-off period [...] on employers would give rise to the constitutional issues and is fraught with legal risk\".  Will the Minister of State publish that legal advice and provide a briefing on the constitutional issues involved?  We all know that many employers will do whatever they can to avoid paying a fair redundancy package to their employees even if they can afford it.  I am not convinced that this provision will not be exploited by employers to allow them to get away with not paying their fair share of redundancy packages.  It should not just be a matter of the statutory payment if employers can afford to contribute.  Many Deputies have been on the picket line in support of workers, most recently the Debenhams workers.  In that case, we saw a major multinational company do its utmost to avoid paying its workers a fair redundancy package that had already been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill.  We will do our best to ensure it passes as quickly as possible so that workers can get their rights and redundancy packages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300035#LL00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1643897700,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 suspended a worker's right to seek redundancy payments when laid off or put on short-time work due to the pandemic.  Deputy Nash of the Labour Party tabled an amendment that would have dealt with this issue at the start of the pandemic and, perhaps, saved the State some share of the burden that may now be necessarily placed upon it.  At the time, we agreed not to pursue the amendment as we were assured that the issue would be dealt with and we did not wish to delay emergency legislation.  The unamended Covid legislation meant that any employee who ended up being made redundant would have had time during the pandemic excluded from any calculated period of redundancy if time spent laid off or on short-time work in the final three years of redundancy was not included in the original legislation.  This Bill is being introduced to ensure there is a scheme to provide a State payment to make up for any time not counted because of time spent laid off during the pandemic.  The fact that workers' minimum statutory payments will be made up by the State through a payment from the Social Insurance Fund in such cases should ensure that the worker will not be out of pocket with regard to their minimum payments in the event of being made redundant having been laid off during the pandemic.  This is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  Normally, under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, when a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund to an employee on an employer's behalf, a debt is raised against that employer.  The Department of Social Protection is legally obliged to recover such debts from the employer.  If this remains the case, the State will be able to pursue solvent employers.  If there is an exemption, we will unfortunately have to put an extra burden on the State, which would not have been needed if this problem had been fixed immediately.<\/p>  <p>  In supporting the legislation as outlined, we appreciate that, at the time, the legislation was put forward because of the need for emergency measures.  However, through Deputy Nash, we made an attempt to improve the original legislation.  We feel that, if we had been listened to, there would not be a need for this measure now.  Perhaps in future discussions between those of us in the Opposition and the Government, the Government will appreciate that the Labour Party and other parties in the Oireachtas come to this space with the best of intentions and from a place of knowledge.  That is particularly true of my colleague, Deputy Nash.  In that regard, while we support the Bill, we would encourage the Government to heretofore understand that many of us in this House are genuinely here to try to improve the lot of the worker and not to cause the Government unnecessary difficulty.  We support the Bill and will be making further contributions as it goes through the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300035#LL00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1643897700,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to have a discussion on this Bill, which will benefit both employers and employees.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, on their ongoing efforts to support businesses and workers across the State.  It would be remiss of me not to also acknowledge the work of others, particularly those on the relevant committee, for the work they put into this.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is symbolic of a suite of measures that Government and my own party have taken to protect workers, while allowing the labour market and enterprises to grow even stronger.  These measures include a wide range of improvements in the pay and conditions of workers across the State including, but not limited to, improvements in parental leave and the introduction of a new public holiday on 18 March and subsequently every St. Brigid's Day from 2023 onwards.  We have also seen new measures brought in to protect workers' rights to keep their tips and gratuities.  That was not only right but long overdue.  Auto-enrolment for pensions will soon be introduced and the minimum wage has increased seven if not eight times over the last decade, since Fine Gael entered Government.  This has had a profound impact on the lives of workers.  Furthermore, workers now have the right to request remote working with an option to appeal decisions to the Workplace Relations Commission, allowing for a more flexible and adaptable approach to work.  Statutory sick pay will add another layer of protection for employees.  It will be one less thing to worry about.  A large amount of work has also gone into the introduction of a living wage in Ireland.  I note the ongoing work of Deputy Nash on that matter along with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  Fine Gael has also remained steadfastly committed to the reduction of the tax burden on low and middle-income earners.  This is an important step that cannot be overlooked.<\/p>  <p>  The Opposition often attacks the Government, and Fine Gael specifically, with regard to workers' rights but, having named just a few recent successes, it is clear these are political charges not backed up by facts or the reality faced by workers every day.  Progress must be recognised for what it is.  I do not claim that we have got everything right, but I firmly believe that workers in Ireland are better off today than at any other time in the history of the State.  We have an unprecedented 2.47 million people in employment.  This is a remarkable achievement when one considers how matters stood in March 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The country has gone into a radical recovery and, despite the challenges we have faced throughout the pandemic, we have emerged with strong growth forecasted for the years ahead.  We have managed to do this because we entered into the pandemic from a position of strength.  Indeed, during the pandemic, we saw swift and comprehensive action to protect both businesses and employees.  We saw this in the introduction of the PUP, the wage subsidy scheme, etc.  There can be no doubt that these measures made an invaluable contribution to people's lives during the pandemic and ensured that many businesses survived what was an unprecedented period.  To my mind, these decisions reflected an attempt to be as fair and all-encompassing as possible in a time of global uncertainty and instability.  I note that both Houses collectively supported virtually every measure that was introduced, particularly in 2020.  Collectively, we worked extremely well under the circumstances to put in place the measures that were introduced.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is yet another effort and another example of the Government's continuing commitment to people and businesses.  It will help employees recently made redundant who lost out on reckonable service during the emergency period, which has been extended until September next.<\/p> <p>It will ensure that employees will be able to avail of a special, tax-free, State payment of up to &euro;1,860.  It will allow employees to claim what is rightfully theirs.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste has demonstrated the foresight to ensure that the wave of redundancy claims will not impact on the ability of businesses to recover as we emerge from two years of restrictions and business closures.  When the history of this pandemic is eventually written, it will show that the Government and, indeed, these Houses rose to the occasion and led our people safely through the fight against this deadly virus.  It will also show that the Government, at every turn, has put people&rsquo;s health and safety first and spared no expense in supporting people financially in the context of the decision to prioritise health.<\/p> <p> This is not an easy time, and many families have endured stress and worry regarding whether their jobs, companies or industries would be there when the restrictions were lifted.  Given the numbers in employment and our economic recovery, which has been nothing short of miraculous, I hope this legislation, support for which has been demonstrated in the contributions thus far, will have a swift passage through the Houses and will be enacted as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300035#LL00400","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643898300,"counter":406,"content":"<p>This is a short but important Bill, which Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting.  It will amend the principal Act to provide for once-off redundancy payments for workers in respect of certain lay-off periods from 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2021.  My colleague, An Teachta O&rsquo;Reilly, became aware of this problem early in the pandemic and has introduced the Redundancy Payments (Lay-off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill 2021 to the House to address this issue.  An Teachta O&rsquo;Reilly Bill seeks to deliver a fair calculation of recognisable service for workers on the PUP who may lose out on significant sums of money in future redundancy payments.  As matters stand, due to a loophole in the law, workers could lose out on significant sums because time spent on the PUP will not count when calculating entitlements.  This Bill seeks to make that time reckonable service, which will ensure that workers will not have a lost year when it comes to future redundancy entitlements.  When the PUP was introduced last year, redundancy entitlements were suspended for people who were temporarily laid off.  Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 was temporarily suspended during the Covid-19 crisis, which ensured that employees were protected from being made redundant.  Employers were also protected because the measure meant that a large number of workers were not applying for redundancy payments.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, statutory redundancy is based on duration of the service.  Under the existing Act as well, periods of lay-offs during the final three years of service do not count as reckonable service.  This means that redundancy entitlements will not factor in those periods.  This legislation ensures that those workers can access a special tax-free State payment of up to &euro;1,860, which will be provided for out of the Social Insurance Fund.  Employers will not be liable for this compensatory repayment, which is only right.  Such an imposition could endanger the viability of some businesses which would otherwise be able to recover.<\/p>  <p>  It was great to see measures being possible during the pandemic that were previously judged to be too socialist or too anti-private property rights to be introduced.  I urge the Government to embrace its inner socialist and try to address the housing, education and health crises with a similar attitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300036#MM00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1643898300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>That might be a bit hopeful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300036#MM00300","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1643898300,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Catherine Murphy next.

I have come straight from the Committee on Public Accounts to the Chamber and I had to negotiate several flights of stairs in between.<\/p><p>Like many aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the full impact on the workforce is probably yet to be seen.  It will likely take years for us to fully comprehend the massive shifts that have and are taking place.  The Department&rsquo;s estimate is that between 25,000 and 56,000 people are expected to be laid off as a result of Covid-19.  It is not something that will only be experienced during the pandemic; it is a phenomenon that will continue and that will have residual effects.  We are most likely to see these lay-offs in sectors which have yet to bounce back from the impact of Covid-19.  I refer to the hospital sector, catering companies, leisure centres and firms involved in large-scale event work.  Indeed, a great deal of tax has been warehoused and much extra debt has been accrued in specific sectors.  Viability in that context is going to be determined by just how robust the recovery is.  We also cannot assume that there will be no further interruptions, but let us hope not.  There is a real issue in this regard, however.<\/p><p>From March 2020 to September 2021, thousands of workers existed in a state of limbo.  They had either been laid off or shifted onto part-time work during the pandemic.  That was understandable.  In many cases, they watched as their places of work struggled and they knew that in many cases their jobs were not going to be there for them to return to.  I have encountered situations where people had been in a job for 20 years, for example, in a pub, and they were not sure if that pub was going to reopen.  If it did reopen, and the people concerned had taken other jobs in the meantime, where would they stand then in respect of redundancy rights?  I am talking about matters like that.<\/p><p>The emergency measures introduced in March 2020 suspended workers' rights to seek redundancy from their employer.  When that provision ended on 30 September, workers were left in a situation where they could be penalised under the terms of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, which does not recognise lay-off periods in the final three years of employment as reckonable service.  Under those rules, Covid-19 lay-off periods would not be counted when workers' statutory redundancy was calculated.  Thankfully, this Bill will amend that situation and bridge the gap in redundancy payments for those laid off during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is welcome that the Department is acting on this matter, and that it has engaged with SIPTU and ICTU on the issue.  There will be quite a bit of that kind of patching up required in the context of the impact of Covid-19.<\/p><p>I note that the original intention was to have this Bill passed before Christmas.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case and we are now in a situation whereby some workers have been left without payments for three months.  That is a long time for someone to be waiting for a vital payment, and especially over Christmas when household costs are so high.  I accept, however, that it takes time to frame legislation and there is a pipeline of legislation.  This legislation would have been put on that conveyor belt of Bills.<\/p><p>Staff at the Celbridge Manor Hotel in my constituency received their redundancy notices last November, with the promise that they would receive payments before Christmas.  Their state of limbo continues today, and no statutory payments have issued.  Indeed, the hotel&rsquo;s owner has dangled the idea of an extra 10% gratuity being added to their statutory entitlements in exchange for the workers' being legally bound to a gagging clause concerning the matter.  This was reported by<i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>on several occasion.  I find this situation unacceptable.  I have continuously contacted the various Departments involved to try to get some finality in this case.  This legislation is therefore extremely welcome, and it must be passed urgently.  I wish, though, that there had been some foresight in the context of having this Bill ready for consideration as soon as the suspension of redundancies was lifted.<\/p><p>As I said, however, we are happy to support the Bill.  It is welcome.  If there is a criticism to be made, it is that if it could have been done sooner, then that would have made a significant difference to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300036#MM00500","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1643898900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I will be sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett and, possibly, Deputy Barry.<\/p>  <p>  I will start by making some suggestions as to how the small but positive reforms contained in this Bill could be improved before moving on to the wider issue of workers' rights.  The Bill states that periods of time up to September 2021 during which workers were laid off because of Covid emergency measures will be included in their reckonable periods of service for the purpose of statutory redundancy payments.  However, anyone laid off because of Covid since the end of September 2021 will not have those lay-off periods counted.  This would penalise night club and pub workers who were laid off because of Government-mandated closures or restricted opening hours between October 2021 and January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government may argue in response that normal redundancy rights were restored at the end of September, meaning that employees facing lay-offs after that date could have claimed redundancy as normal whereas previously those rights were suspended, but this effectively means forcing anyone who was laid off because of Covid since September to choose between triggering redundancy and giving up on getting his or her job back on the one hand and, on the other, being laid off for a period of time that will not be included in his or her reckonable service for redundancy purposes.  That is unfair and must be changed, and we will seek to amend it.<\/p>  <p>  It is an issue that the Bill only applies to statutory redundancy, where workers who have negotiated better redundancy terms with their employers will not automatically be entitled to have lay-off periods included in their periods of reckonable service and will have to struggle individually or collectively as groups of workers with a private employer to win it.<\/p>  <p>  I also raise a question relating to profitable companies that may be winding up or making a number of workers redundant for non-financial reasons not having to cover these costs themselves rather than it falling to the State to do so.  There is already evidence of profitable companies super-exploiting pandemic-related corporate welfare, for example, companies paying dividends while receiving the employment wage subsidy.  The absence of any attempt to deter this and the light touch approach taken in general to policing the billions of euro in corporate welfare that were handed out during the pandemic stands in stark contrast with the punitive approach taken towards those on the PUP.  The PUP was the first Covid support to be cut long before anything for businesses.  It is not so long ago that workers were claiming they faced having their payments stopped if they were intercepted by social welfare inspectors at the airport.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make an additional point about the relatively small payout compared to the cost of living and the scale of the oncoming redundancies.  The Bill entitles covered workers to a maximum additional payout of &euro;1,860.  This is approximately the equivalent of one month's rent in Dublin and much less than the anticipated rise in the cost of basic necessities over the next year.  While it is welcome, it is not going to go far.  It is a drop in the ocean considering the tidal wave of involuntary redundancies coming our way once Covid payments to businesses are withdrawn.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS is to end for many businesses from 30 April and for businesses affected by the last round of Covid restrictions - mainly in hospitality, the arts and entertainment - from 30 May.  It is only then that we will begin to have a clearer picture of the longer term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on employment.  At the committee yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste trumpeted last December's 7.5% unemployment rate, but that may prove premature.  The latest figures show 75,000 people still on the PUP and a further 279,000 on the EWSS, yet the T&aacute;naiste has previously estimated a maximum of 56,000 redundancies over the next three years.  The &euro;150 million budget for the expansion of State payments under the Bill suggests that a higher number - perhaps in the region of 80,000 - is anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  However many workers end up losing their jobs, it must be a core priority that not one worker loses out on any of his or her redundancy entitlements, be that from the State or his or her employer.  Unfortunately, the Government has not taken this obvious opportunity while it is reforming redundancy law anyway to give workers what they really need and deserve, namely, the right to receive every cent of what they are rightfully owed by employers, including additional redundancy payments, and to be first in line when companies are liquidated.<\/p>  <p>  This was a core demand of the Debenhams workers.  They stood on picket lines in all weathers for 406 days during a global pandemic.  These heroic and mainly female workers were betrayed time and again, not only by their employer, but the Government, which stood behind them with crocodile tears.  Unfortunately, they were also failed by aspects of the trade union leadership.  As with the Clerys workers before them, the Government sat on its hands, pretending it was useless for anything stronger than tea and sympathy or a few claps for front-line workers.<\/p>  <p>  What would a left government that actually cared about workers' rights do in this situation?  It would immediately legislate to protect workers in collective redundancy situations by putting them at the top of the queue.  That could be done by amending the Companies Act 2014 to provide for preferential creditor status to employees in collective redundancies and to include all payments due to workers in the list of payments covered.  That is what we proposed in our Private Members' Bill last May.  Fearing a public outcry at a time when public support for the Debenhams workers was widespread, the Government took the cynical decision not to oppose openly our Companies (Protection of Employees' Rights in Liquidations) Bill 2021, otherwise known as the Debenhams Bill.  Of course, the Government has failed to do anything since to progress our Bill or to improve workers' rights in collective redundancy situations materially.  It has a golden opportunity to that now when it is amending the law on redundancies for other reasons, but it has chosen not to.  We will be submitting amendments in line with the Debenhams Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The second and even more important thing that a left government with an eco-socialist programme would do would be to carry out a radical overhaul of workers' rights in this country.  The Industrial Relations Act 1990 must be repealed and replaced with a charter of workers' rights.  It would include the right to establish pickets and workplace occupations, the right to engage in political and sympathy strikes, and the right to mandatory trade union recognition, as proposed in People Before Profit's Trade Union Recognition Bill 2021.  Without these rights, the workers' movement is fighting with one hand tied behind its back, which is, of course, the whole point of the 1990 Act.  In most other European countries, workers are not legally prohibited from striking in support of another group of workers.  In Ireland, though, the Government has banned both political and sympathy strikes.  This is despite our proud history of the world famous Dunnes anti-apartheid strike.  Nearly 40 years on, parties on all sides of this House would profess to believe that the strikers were on the side of right, yet such a strike could not legally take place today against, for example, Israel despite its recently being declared an apartheid state by human rights organisations from Amnesty International to Human Rights Watch.<\/p>  <p>  The right to mandatory trade union recognition, as proposed in People Before Profit's Trade Union Recognition Bill 2021 and commonplace in most other European countries, is also a fundamental workers' right.  Without it, many workers' rights on paper are rendered essentially meaningless.  In this situation, it is hardly surprising that union membership fell from 33% in 2005 to 24% in 2018.  Collective bargaining coverage is approximately 33%, the seventh lowest of 22 EU countries.<\/p>  <p>  We need to tackle the significant increase in precarious work, gig work and bogus self-employment.  The Government has sat on its hands while precarious employment among young people has reached unprecedented levels.  Research by the National Youth Council of Ireland found that 38% of people aged between 18 and 29 years were on temporary contracts.  A \"staggering 82 per cent\" said precarious work was the only work available.  Over 70% said that their current temporary or part-time contracts were causing them serious hardship.  Part-time and temporary workers are also more likely to be low paid.  Half of precarious workers under 30 years of age earn less than the living wage.  On top of this, workers under 20 years of age are discriminated against by only being legally entitled to lower minimum wage rates.  This D&aacute;il term, I will be introducing the national minimum wage (equal pay for young workers) Bill, which will abolish discriminatory lower minimum wage rates for young workers, including apprentices.<\/p>  <p>  To fight for workers' rights, higher pay in a time of soaring inflation and decent redundancies, we need to build an active rank and file base in the trade unions and reinvigorate them as democratic, fighting organisations, North and South.<\/p> <p>It is only through an active, rank and file, fighting trade union movement that we can restore public sector pay, reverse cuts and fight for equal and better pay and conditions and decent redundancy pay for all workers, regardless of gender, race, disability or immigration status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300037#NN00100","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643899500,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Without a shadow of a doubt, the most high-profile redundancy that took place during the Covid-19 period, to which this Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill is a response, was the Debenhams redundancy.  Why does this Bill not involve trying to do something to compensate the Debenhams workers for the failure and inadequacy of legislation to protect against the sort of strategic liquidation that Debenhams engaged in with devastating consequences for the Debenhams workers?<\/p>  <p>  I met with the Debenhams workers yesterday and it was interesting just to refresh my own memory of the circumstances.  Where is the Government's response to what happened to them?  Where is the change in the law on redundancy to prevent that kind of strategic liquidation where workers are denied the redundancy entitlements they should get?  Of course, the Minister of State will know and recall that the workers had an agreement that they would receive two weeks' statutory pay plus two weeks' salary for each year of service.  They did not get that.  They fought an incredible battle for more than a year on the picket lines.  As they reminded me yesterday, some of the women had never been on a picket line in their lives.  For more than a year, from early morning until late at night, sometimes literally around the clock, in a loading bay at the back of the Ilac Centre in the case of the Henry Street branch and at Debenhams stores across the country, more than 1,000 women were forced to engage in that action because of the law.  I have some questions in that regard, as do the workers.<\/p>  <p>  As I and the workers understand it, when someone is made redundant there is supposed to be a staged process of notice, which I think runs for a period of between 30 and 90 days, depending on the particular situation.  None of this happened in the case of Debenhams.  In early April 2020, the workers received an email from the CEO of Debenhams in which he informed them that they should ignore media speculation about possible redundancies, they should not worry, there was no problem and their jobs were safe.  One week later, the same CEO sent an email telling the workers their jobs were gone.  They never heard from the company again.<\/p>  <p>  The workers have a question.  It is not an allegation; they want clarification on the facts.  As they understand it, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has to be notified about such large collective redundancies.  I know the Minister of State may not be able to answer the question now, but the workers would like an answer as to when, during that period, the Department was first notified of the redundancies and what the response of the Government was.  They would very much appreciate a response to that question and I think they are owed it.  Furthermore, how was it that Debenhams could do that when there was a statutory process around it, which seemed to be utterly disregarded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300038#OO00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1643899500,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy is going to relate this to the Bill being debated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300038#OO00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643899500,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I am because it is a redundancy payments Bill.

They did not get any of their entitlements.  I am asking whether this Bill addresses that.  That is the question.  Does the Bill address it?  If not, why not?  I think the Minister of State needs to understand what happened and needs to tell us what he knows because we cannot prevent this from happening again unless we get answers these questions.  That must be done so that there is a legislative response and we have an opportunity to table amendments on the next Stage that could address the deficiencies - if there are such, and it would seem to me that there are - in respect of what happened in the Debenhams case.<\/p><p>The other question is how, in this circumstance, could a company that goes into liquidation then move &euro;50 million out of the Debenhams online business, <i>Debenhams.ie<\/i>, which is clearly part of the Debenhams consortium and which is directly linked to the stores and so on?  What is it about the law that would allow that to happen?  How can that happen?  What are we going to do to stop it happening, so that the just redundancy entitlement that the workers should have is not stolen from them, through what are essentially accountancy tricks, by the company moving assets that should be available for the redundancy payment?<\/p><p>What are we going to do about the fact the Debenhams consortium was able to load the Irish company with a whole series of debts that it did not have and which properly belonged to the British company?  It loaded those debts on to further remove, as it were, assets that might have been available to pay the redundancy for the workers.  These sorts of loopholes can be exploited and there is a sharp practice that follows from it from companies in order to avoid paying workers their just entitlement.  It should be noted that all that value that <i>Debenhams.ie<\/i>built up and all those assets were essentially assets that were created through the labour, hard work and decency of good workers who were loved by the customers of Debenhams.  All of that goodwill that Debenhams had, and which gave it its value, was robbed from the workers through accountancy tricks.  What are we doing to prevent that happening so that workers get their just redundancy and the State and the taxpayer are not on the hook for the sharp practice of companies engaging in what clearly looks like and is, in my view and that of the workers, a strategic liquidation?<\/p><p>The workers have issued an invitation to the Minister of State.

The workers will probably send him a written invitation to participate.<\/p><p>Everybody at the time, including the Government and the Opposition, accepted that a great wrong had been done.  The case that was always made by the Government was that its hands were tied because the law is the law.  What we are going to do to ensure this never happens again and that workers robbed of their redundancy entitlements will have them guaranteed?  What we are going to do to ensure we have the laws in place to prevent the absolutely appalling and disgusting behaviour that Debenhams engaged in from ever happening again?

It is a short Bill.  We support it and we support what it sets out to do.  However, there are other issues in this area that also need to be examined.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that many workers face redundancy and a very uncertain future.<\/p> <p>It is a difficulty that arose in this particular situation.  Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act was suspended during the Covid-19 crisis.  As a result employees were protected from being made redundant.  It also had that knock-on effect at the time they were either off work or whatever that a significant number were concerned that they had lost up to a year of reckonable service in the calculation of any future redundancy payment due to the time they spent on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  <\/p> <p> The time spent by workers laid off or on short time, such as in receipt of that payment, is calculable as reckonable service in the calculation of redundancy entitlements.  That is what this Bill is attempting to do.  It is welcome and it is what we want to see happen as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> The experience of so many workers, and our colleague referred a few moments ago to the Debenhams workers as an example, is that it is a crisis in their lives.  This week we have an issue in County Sligo in Collooney where B. Braun Hospicare Ireland, a company which produces dressings, has decided that it is going to cease production and will be closing down over a period of 18 months.  There are 89 workers there, 80 of whom are going to be made redundant.  While their company is assuring them that it will be 18 months away, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, the Debenhams workers were told initially that their future was secure and that there was restructuring and not to worry.  Very quickly, things change.  Things can change for workers and the great fear is that workers are not sufficiently protected in those circumstances.  Everything that needs to be done should be done.  While this Bill is very specific in what it is doing, and I appreciate and understand that, there needs to be much more done to ensure large companies of this nature, in particular, deal fairly with their workforce who have been loyal to them for so long.<\/p> <p> In respect of this company in Sligo, it began in 1984.  Decades of service have been given to the local community and economy which has built that company up to being very profitable over that time.  Many of the workers feel that they are being cast aside at this stage.  It is most unfortunate.  <\/p> <p> This legislation is looking at a very small piece of this issue but there is so much more that needs to be done in that entire area to ensure that workers' rights are upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300038#OO00500","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643900100,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Collins is sharing with Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300039#PP00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643900100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  While this Bill is welcome, it comes very late for many workers who have worked hard in the workplace, and have been let very badly down.  The Bill is technical in nature and comprises four sections.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide for the making of a once-off State-funded payment to workers facing redundancy who have lost the opportunity to procure reckonable service due to layoffs caused by the Covid-19 restrictions.  The proposed legislative change is intended to ensure that such workers will receive full redundancy entitlements, as though they had not been laid off during the emergency period of 13 March 2022 to 30 September 2021 and to ensure that employers are not burdened with that cost to enhance their recovery viability.  Government-mandated restrictions have caused workers to lose the opportunity to procure reckonable service through no fault of their own or their employers.  For this reason, a reckonable service Covid-19-related payment is to be funded by the State based on the duration of the Covid-19 restrictions.  The maximum State payment to which a person made redundant will be entitled to is &euro;1,860 tax-free if they were laid off for the entire period of the restrictions and were earning &euro;600 or more per week.  Payments for periods of layoffs arising from Covid-19 restrictions will be made by the Department of Social Protection out of the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that payments through the scheme will be operational for a period of three years until 1 October 2024.  People who have already been made redundant since March 2020 and who have been laid off due to the Covid-19 will be covered under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  When we are talking about workers' rights, I have many constituents who have so many issues in respect of pensions and miscommunications between the various Departments.  I have one lady who can prove she has made 520 contributions and yet she cannot receive her pension.  Mind you, she received it initially but it was then taken from her.<\/p>  <p>  I know of another very ill man who was self-employed for years.  When he applied for illness benefit he was turned down.  He then applied for invalidity benefit and he was again turned down.  The problem was that he did not have enough contributions from the previous years and the reason for this was that he was too ill to work or claim any welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  This system is not good enough and measures need to be put in place for exceptional cases and to allow deciding officers to use a little bit of discretion for extreme cases.  Let us face it, a little bit of cop on should be used for people in extreme circumstances and for people who have worked extremely hard all their lives and deserve a break.  There is nothing more upsetting than having to tell somebody who is very ill and has a large number of bills and overheads and a family that they are entitled to nothing.  It is terrible to have to say that to them.  Their social welfare office will try every measure from every angle, even contacting the Minister, although not personally but her Department, to see if there is any possibility a payment can be made to a person who is very ill and is a deserving case.  Proof from accountants, doctors and medical people are provided but this still does not work as it falls between two stools, which is a terribly unfair situation.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill probably comes too late for Debenhams workers.  Much has been said about them today, with, in fairness, well-voiced concerns expressed about the way these workers were treated, which was appallingly.  I know some of these workers who are from my end of west Cork and I was in contact with them during their crisis.  To be honest with the Minister of State, there was little compassion shown in here for the Debenhams workers.  Some of these workers had worked all their lives and knew nothing about protesting.  They only joined the protest because they were in extreme circumstances and were left there by the State.  The State sometimes needs to stand up with a strong voice coming from its leadership.  That might send a message.  Perhaps Debenhams is above listening to the people.<\/p>  <p>  We have the same situation in west Cork with Cara Lodge residential treatment centre where 27 employees working in west Cork&rsquo;s only addiction treatment centre for teenage boys was closed in September 2020 due the Covid-19.  Given that this was the only addiction centre, one must ask whether addiction ended and whether people need that service any more.  Of course, they need that service.  There were teams of professionals there who worked with the teenagers.  There were administrative staff, cooks, cleaners and maintenance crews.  The redundancy situation which arose from that was a nightmare for these workers.  They lost their jobs and they could not understand why.  A great deal of shenanigans was going on behind the scenes and nobody had the decency to put their hand up and give the full reasons the centre was closing.  Mind you, I hear it has reopened recently under another heading but it is the people who spent years working with these young people there that we must consider.  I spoke to many young people who had come out the other side.  The users of the service were so hurt to think that others who could be in the same circumstances could end up not getting that service and that the employees had lost their jobs after spending many years working there.  On top of losing their jobs then, redundancy became a nightmare for them.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, no constituency escapes redundancy and it reaches every one of them.  It certainly leaves a sting in the tail, however, for many people if back-ups or supports for workers are not there.  To lose one&rsquo;s job is a daunting experience for many when the right supports are not there and it leaves people feeling extremely vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister of State to address the issues I have mentioned, namely, extreme illnesses and pain.  He may not be the Minister of State in charge of that area but he might sit down with his colleagues and look at a situation where a payment can be made to people in those circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300039#PP00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1643900100,"counter":419,"content":"<p>This amending Bill will recognise that no newly-redundant workers will have lost out on their reckonable service while they were temporarily laid off due to Covid-19 regulations.  It also highlights these employees were not necessarily laid off and that they had not qualified for a State payment - the PUP or the jobseeker's allowance.  The objective of this amending Bill is to address that gap.  It allows the person to qualify for a Social Insurance Fund payment of &euro;1,860.  Employers are not liable for this shortfall in the period from March 2020.  I understand the significance of the gap highlighted in this amending Bill and what this entails.<\/p> <p>The Debenhams workers in Limerick and the way they were treated by an international company that moved its assets out of the country to another international company has already been mentioned in the Chamber.  The company did that to get away from what it should have given the Irish Debenhams workers for the loyal service given to my county of Limerick and families and people who live there.  They worked hard looking after the shop and the people of Limerick and the surrounding areas.  Debenhams used a different international company to transfer the assets before the Government could do anything and that cannot happen again.<\/p> <p> With rising fuel costs and costs of living in general in this country, how many more companies will fall short?  How many of those will be small and medium enterprises, SMEs?  We might see the same position with redundancies and although international companies might have many millions of euro, 51% of workers are employed by SMEs.  There is currently a high cost of living and cost of running a business; there are high insurance costs across the board.  These SMEs are being crippled as a result.  International companies and those operating across the water can get stuff into this country much cheaper and they can be resupplied at a much cheaper rate than our SMEs.  What happens to the people who will be forced into closure due to rising costs, which the Government could help with?  I have already highlighted how this could happen with fuel costs.<\/p> <p> There are also people in this country who through no fault of their own cannot work.  I know one person who because of a late diagnosis of mental illness could not turn up to work.  He did not qualify for a jobseeker's payment or any medical support.  He cannot now get any funding while his wife and two children are trying to fight fires that are dropping all around him.  They are trying to quench those fires so the family can survive but there is no recognition that the person has not worked at times over the past two years because of mental illness.  They now know what was wrong but the family qualifies for nothing because it was not recognised when he was working.  The period in question is two years and exceptional cases must be allowed for people to qualify in such circumstances.<\/p> <p> I have been self-employed for more than 30 years.  I look at my local publicans, shopkeepers and people in small industry around me who are like me.  The legislation and criteria being put in place by us aimed at multinational companies will cripple our own economy, particularly the people who keep our children in summer jobs during college, for example.  These people are trying to feed their families but we are crippling them with enforcement of regulations in this country.  I need the Minister of State to help me get the Departments to understand what it is like to be somebody in an SME.  Last night I spoke to such matters and I was corrected on one of my comments.  I accept that.  Nevertheless, I spoke as somebody in the Rural Independent Group, where most of us are self-employed.  We bring to this Chamber real-life experience of people running a business outside this Chamber.  We can see first-hand how other businesses struggle with insurance and the day-to-day running of their business while trying to keep the doors open.  They are trying to compete with multinationals.<\/p> <p> I have an example.  In a city there are massive supermarkets but in my parish, which includes Granagh, Ballingarry and Croom, we have good sized shops but there is a smaller population.  As a result the figures for food costs are slightly higher than what may be the case in the cities.  What is in place to help SMEs outside a large populated area, as the costs for running the business are the same?  If a business operates in a small parish, such as Granagh, and it is ratable, it provides for the community around it, including items such as fuel.  That may be gas, coal, briquettes or whatever people want, but it needs them in large quantities so they can be some way affordable for those people.  The business must stock all these different products to cover the area, which might have 400 or 500 people within a radius of five, six or seven miles.  The rates paid in the county are the same as those paid in the city, despite such businesses not having a fraction of the footfall.  These businesses are working for the community, however, and I can get my loaf of bread or milk without having to travel 20 miles or 30 miles to the nearest supermarket.<\/p> <p> They are also a point where people can meet their neighbours; the hub of a parish.  Years ago we had a pub in every parish but in some parishes we are lucky if there is a shop.  There should be a hall, a church and facilities for GAA and soccer but the shop or SME is the hub.  In our areas, they are so important to the communities.  They are also important as they provide employment and a service to older people in our communities, including getting basic food items for the week.<\/p> <p> I want us to consider what we can put in place for SMEs in this country that are providing a service for the rural people of Ireland in the likes of my county.  What can we do to advise the Government and show what such companies can do on the ground?  I mentioned Ballingarry, which has a supermarket used by people all around it.  Again, that business does not have the same footfall as a business in the city.  A shop in a city might have three or four different items and the neighbouring shop might have three or four different items and they can survive because of footfall.  In the countryside, a shop must have everything people want in one shop.<\/p> <p> A business is rateable on the size of a property and if there is a bathroom on the premises.  That is a facility for somebody who may be passing through on their way to Kerry or Cork but it means the business is rateable if that person wants to go to the bathroom.  All these elements must be examined and we must consider how we can keep our communities together and help them grow.<\/p> <p> I support the legislation but it must go much further.  I need the Minister of State's help within the Government to get people to understand rural living and the work of SMEs.  It is not all about international companies.  We can see what an international company did to the people of Limerick with the example of Debenhams.  The action was too little, too late in that respect.  I appreciate any help the Minister of State can give me in helping to protect SMEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300039#PP00400","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643900700,"counter":421,"content":"<p>In fairness, we support this legislation, which is clearly necessary.  It addresses a shortfall that Deputy Louise O'Reilly would have pointed out at a very early stage.  There is support for this right across the House because it does not make sense that there should be a scenario where workers would lose out on reckonable time relating to redundancy on the basis of being on the pandemic unemployment payment for a time.  All the supports provided by the State to workers and businesses were about ensuring we could keep the show on the road for society and businesses.  It was about ensuring workers and their families would be okay during the pandemic and everyone would be able to do the right thing during the period of restrictions.<\/p> <p>This is literally us following up on one of those gaps that have appeared between stools.  It is necessary work that needs to happen.  Obviously, there will be a Covid-19 payment from the Social Insurance Fund just to ensure there is no shortfall.  We all accept that.  We all accept that there are significant shortfalls across the board in the context of redundancy as a whole.<\/p> <p> Recently, 100 workers have been made redundant from National Pen in Dundalk.  There have also been redundancies at Hilton Food in Drogheda.  I am going to speak about National Pen because the T&aacute;naiste has stated that a generous package will be given to workers.  I have spoken to some of the workers at this company.  Negotiations, or at least meetings on negotiations, have started, but no timeline in respect of the redundancies has been provided.  We know it is approximately a year, but we do not know exactly what the timeline is for specific workers.  We are not entirely sure what package is being proposed.   The T&aacute;naiste stated that he is not sure about it.  I know there cannot be direct engagement but there has not been a good history in the context of National Pen.  Its communications with its workers were absolutely dreadful.  This is something we will all have to keep an eye on.  Beyond that, once again we are talking about a non-unionised workforce.  We really have to get to grips with the right to collective bargaining because, otherwise, we will have more of these situations.<\/p> <p> If I had more time, I would address the need to consider the issues relating to insurance.  I have spoken before on that matter.  There is also the issue of the regional skills forum.

They were only on the picket line because this Government and previous Governments failed to implement the Duffy-Cahill report, yet here we are, 258 days later, and the Debenhams workers are still waiting for that training fund.  This cannot be yet another promise broken by Fine Gael, which has never managed to put workers first.  There is a need to work with the workers, iron out the details and ensure this fund is delivered.  The Debenhams workers stood on the picket line through freezing winters and through scandalous treatment by Debenhams, KPMG and this Government that did not care about them.  Government Deputies and councillors stood on the picket lines and made promises to these people but those promises were never delivered on.  There were no champagne parties for the workers, no trips to Dubai for wellness and no &euro;81,000 pay increases.  These workers were left without redundancy by a company that was very profitable and hived money away to England and other places.  Instead, the Government has not even delivered the training fund it promised.  It is shameful.<\/p>  <p>  What is even more shameful is that these workers were only in this dispute because the Government never implemented the Duffy-Cahill report.  I refer to redundancy loopholes.  We have seen it with the Clerys workers, the Coca Cola workers in Cork, the Vita Cortex workers in Cork and the Debenhams workers.  These situations have been occurring since the report that would finally see workers put first was published, but the Government has still not delivered on it.<\/p>  <p>  Why is it that when workers, the backbone of the economy, come looking for the most basic level of respect and protections, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party look the other way?  This legislation is welcome but it does not go far enough.  It does not go where we need it to go.

This is a short Bill that tries to focus on one category of people who are missing out due to lay-offs during the Covid restrictions and the reckonable service on which they have missed out.  I have discussed the matter in the House with various Deputies during the past two years.  We said we would have a response ready to deal with this and that is what the legislation before the House is doing.  I am conscious that it has given rise to much discussion on other issues.  I will try to deal with that briefly in a moment.<\/p>  <p>  I get the impression that Deputy Gould has been working on his speech for the past two years, trying to cover bits and pieces.  I wish to be clear.  I have repeatedly stated in the House, whether here in Leinster House or down in the convention centre, and at committee meetings that it is not true to say that if the recommendations of the Duffy-Cahill report had been implemented, what happened to the Debenhams workers could have been prevented.  The latter is not true and we have to face up to that.  The authors of the report stated that at the committee.  I met the Debenhams workers and their union representatives at a very early stage, along with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and others, on a few occasions.  We gave two commitments and they had two asks for their campaign.  The first was that they wanted to see their collective agreement honoured by the company.  The agreement went beyond the statutory payments.  The State can only guarantee statutory payments.  That is what we do.  I am happy to have a debate on whether those statutory payments should be increased.  That is something we could do.  They have been there since 2002.  I am open to that.  However, the State and the Social Insurance Fund that everybody pays into can only honour statutory payments.  They cannot go beyond that and honour agreements that are reached individually between companies and employees.  That is above what the State can guarantee because such agreements could be different in every situation.  Deputies have to be honest and fair about that.<\/p>  <p>  I have said it before and I will say it again that the Debenhams workers were wronged by that company.  They missed out on their collective agreement.  They were also wronged by others and were given misinformation and false hope.  I never try to do that and never would do that, but I did commit to work with them where we felt we could strengthen the legislation.  That was a commitment we gave.  We worked with the unions to try to help them get their entitlements and packages.  The State did get involved in respect of a certain package relating to training and supports and so on.  I believe that is there and should be there and tapped into.  I am happy to work with others on that.  The last time I checked, everybody who applied for a statutory payment had received one.  The State does protect workers in redundancy situations and it stands behind those statutory repayments.  It is wrong to keep alluding to other issues.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised issues that I am happy to tease through with him again.  I will meet the workers if that is what they want.  That is fine.  However, he and other Deputies have repeated this link to assets and money.  The courts do not agree with them on that.  I have asked on many occasions for Deputies who stand up in the House and make such claims with authority to show us the evidence.  No one has come to me with anything.  Deputies make statements in the House that they claim are factually correct.  The courts judge these matters and those judgments are not in agreement with the Deputies in question, or have not been as yet.  The receiver has a job to do.  If assets were moved, the law does provide protections in that regard.  However, that is not what has come through in the courts and no Member of this House has provided me with any proof in that regard.  I want to put that out there.  We would act on such evidence.  The law is there to act on it.<\/p>  <p>  Some Deputies constantly link this back to the Duffy-Cahill report or the Clerys workers.  Those are different situations and nobody has given me evidence to show any different.  I would certainly work on that if I had it.  I did commit to the workers that if we could, we would strengthen the legislation in respect of workers' rights in redundancy situations.  The T&aacute;naiste also gave that commitment.  We are prepared to do that.  We announced an update in that regard which I will also provide to the House.  Following the engagement with the Debenhams workers, I said I would use my time in this Department, along with the T&aacute;naiste, to strengthen the legislation to make it better for workers in the future if we can do so and if the need is proven.  That does not mean that we said the recommendations in the Duffy-Cahill report are the answer to that issue.  That has been well teased out at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Following extensive engagement with the social partners in the context of the debate arising from the treatment of the Debenhams workers and other situations since then, the plan for action in respect of collective redundancies following insolvency was published in June 2021.  It sets out several commitments to safeguard further the rights of workers in these circumstances, including a range of amendments to company law and employment law, setting up an employment law review group on a statutory basis and the provision of an accessible guidance document to help workers and their representatives to navigate the existing legal framework.  Again, there was a significant amount of misinformation.  Workers were given misinformation at a very early stage in the context of Debenhams.  That guidance document is very important in the context of people's rights, but also to make sure that people can pursue their rights.  We will help them with that as well.<\/p> <p>The guidance was published on the Department's website in December 2021.  The document aims to ensure that employees are aware of the protections that exist for employees whose employment is ending in redundancy.  The most relevant pieces of information have been brought together to ensure that employees are fully informed of their rights and can act accordingly.<\/p> <p> Other recommendations, such as the rescue process for small and micro companies, were progressed in the Companies Acts.  The remaining company law recommendations will be progressed this year.  Work on drafting amendments to the Protection of Employment Act 1977 will commence in quarter 1 of 2022.<\/p> <p> The independent employment law review group that we agreed to establish will be established this year.  It will comprise expert stakeholders and will help to shape the formulation of policy and legislation to ensure that Ireland employment law framework remains fit for purpose and adapts to the evolving contemporary workplace.  <\/p> <p> This complementary range of measures will promote the provision of quality information, enhanced participation and transparency for those workers facing collective redundancy following a company law insolvency.  It will also provide for the continued development of company law in general, which is what I committed to when I met the Debenhams workers.  That was one part of their campaign, and another was the achievement of the terms of their collective agreement.  That was a matter to do with the company; the State could not get involved because the State can only honour statutory payments from the Social Insurance Fund in order to be fair to everybody.<\/p> <p> I have no issue with having a debate on whether the statutory entitlement should be increased.  The figure was set in 2002, and I am happy to have that debate.  It is a separate discussion that we all have to feed into.  Whatever is agreed has to be level and fair for every employee.  It does not mean that collective agreements that are independent are included.  They are separate, and we have to recognise that.  We discussed options for companies to set money aside to honour personal agreements.  That is something I am all for, but it is beyond the involvement of the State.<\/p> <p> I thank colleagues, most of whom agree with the Bill, and rightly so because it will make sure that employees do not miss out.  Some people asked why employers should not pay for this.  That would not be right, because this is about enforced restrictions on employers and employees.  It is important that we step in quite quickly to put the legislation in place to make sure that nobody misses out due to retirement or reckonable service.<\/p> <p> On why the Bill was not ready in the autumn, we clearly said we would make these payments.  We committed to that and it went through Cabinet in time, before section 12 was related.  There are complications in developing a system to make these payments possible.  That was always going to take a period of time.  While it is to be hoped the legislation will be ready first, work has started and has continued over the past number of months regarding the systems needed to make these payments.  Deputy O'Reilly asked about that.  That work is nearing completion and will be finished before the end of quarter 1.  We will be in a position for the Department of Social Protection to make these payments from quarter 2 onwards.  The payments are guaranteed.  People know they will get them.  They will be paid to the maximum of people's entitlements.  People who were fully laid off right throughout will receive a little over &euro;1,800.  For many others, the figure will be lower.  It will be 20 September 2024 before we can judge the full impact of this.<\/p> <p> While the figures show the cost could potentially be &euro;150 million, we are setting aside &euro;10 million now and we believe it will be a lot less than &euro;150 million.  Thankfully, due to other supports for businesses, employers and jobs, which everybody here agreed with, we are in a position whereby we are having a stronger recovery coming out of Covid than people could have predicted.  It is to be hoped that will reduce the number of redundancies due to Covid and, therefore, the draw on this fund.  The timeline will mean payments can be made in quarter 2<\/p> <p> The matters raised by Deputy Collins were not related to this Bill, but I am happy to have them checked out.  I have covered most of the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Deputy O'Donoghue raised some issues, and I want to assure him that even though I am a Government Deputy, I still meet people who work in businesses and are out there on a daily basis.  As Deputies and Ministers, we meet the same people with the same issues and queries, and we are all equally committed to working through them, whether we are in opposition or in government.  On the image that people try to portray that Government Deputies never get to talk to real people, people need to look at themselves in the mirror.  That is part of our everyday job.  That is why we committed to this Bill a long time ago.  We recognised that businesses and employees would need something like this.  We meet people every day of the week.<\/p> <p> Regarding SME supports, we have shown that response over the past two years.  There was cross-party support for the measures for the SME community because we recognised that SMEs are massive employers in the State and create jobs throughout the country.  When we support SMEs, we support jobs.  We want to have a jobs-led recovery so that we can put in place the resources we need to provide all of the other services across education, health and so on. <\/p> <p> I again thank Deputies for their support for the Bill.  I have dealt with most of the issues raised.

I will open the debate by setting the context for the actions to be taken on foot of this Bill.  Although many Members will be familiar with these issues, it is important to take this opportunity to set out the complex situation we will find ourselves in with regard to energy costs and wider pressures on the cost of living.  I will also describe the sections of the Bill in detail and, with regard to its main provisions, set out the background and why they are needed for the operation of the scheme.  However, my overarching message today is that while the scheme which the Bill will establish is just one of a suite of measures, it is critical that it is put in place within this quarter.  I seek Members' support to achieve that.<\/p><p>First, I will outline the main factors affecting electricity prices in Ireland.  Second, I will provide an overview of the domestic and international response to rising electricity and gas prices.  Third, I will reaffirm the Government's conviction that the best long-term approach for Ireland is to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets.<\/p><p>On the factors affecting Irish electricity prices, Deputies will appreciate that we face additional costs due to our geographical location, fossil fuel dependency, the small scale of the Irish market, low population density and exchange rate fluctuations.  However, the most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the upward trend in international gas prices, which has brought them to an unprecedented high.  In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2020, for a variety of international reasons.  Current indications are that these higher prices will continue at a significantly higher level than in early 2020 for the foreseeable future.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices, as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas due to the fact that gas is used for electricity generation.<\/p><p>It is a matter of serious concern to the Government that recent electricity and gas price increases caused by these international conditions are putting increasing pressure on consumers, particularly those in a more vulnerable economic position.  It is important to recognise that these price increases are not caused by Government or regulatory decisions.  This is because price regulation ended many years ago.  Suppliers compete with each other on price and set their own prices accordingly, as one would expect in a competitive, commercial liberalised market.  Consumers can shop around and switch easily.  It is important to point out that all European markets are experiencing these price increases.  While Ireland has its own specific circumstances, the rise in energy costs is not unique to us.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the international and domestic response.  In general, in terms of the overall cost of living it vital to stress that a co-ordinated, whole-of-government response is being followed.  It is essential in tackling this issue.  In response to rising electricity and gas prices in the EU, the European Commission published a communication in October 2021 entitled, &quot;Tackling rising energy prices: A toolbox for action and support&quot;.  The toolbox sets out the measures available to member states to mitigate the impact of the energy price rises, which, at the same time, do not cut across the EU energy legislative framework or the EU longer-term policy framework for the green transition.  The Government made a number of interventions in budget 2022 in line with measures put forward in the European Commission's toolbox, such as implementing safeguards to avoid customer disconnections, providing supports for consumer empowerment and providing for a supplier of last resort in cases where suppliers exit the market in a disorderly manner.  The electricity costs emergency benefit scheme to be established by this legislation is an additional measure.<\/p><p>The Government's primary response to tackling the impact on households of increasing energy costs has been to use the tax and social welfare system to counter rising costs of living as set out in budget 2022.  The fuel allowance is one of a range of income supports paid by the Department of Social Protection, which also includes general social welfare schemes, the living alone payment increases, to support those living alone and at a higher risk of poverty, and the household benefits package.  Targeted supports are also provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments, ENPs, and urgent needs payments, UNPs.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs, for example, in the case of ill health.  This is in addition to increases in basic welfare and pension rates.  Adjustments to income tax bands have also been introduced primarily as a response to the cost of living increases more generally, driven in part by higher energy prices.<\/p><p>Having regard to the urgent to decarbonise, I will now outline the long-term approach for Ireland.  In that context, the Government's energy efficiency and renewable energy measures are key.  Government policy is driving investment in energy efficiency, investment in renewables, enhancing electricity interconnection and deepening the internal energy market.  I will take energy efficiency as an example.  Energy efficiency measures are not just essential to reduce emissions from our housing sector, they are also central to addressing the root causes of energy poverty and to improving health and social inclusion outcomes, while at the same time contributing to decarbonisation.<\/p><p>The residential energy efficiency budget for my Department in 2022 is &euro;202 million.  Financed by carbon tax revenue, &euro;109 million of this will fund Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, schemes to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or are at risk of, energy poverty.  More than 4,500 homes will benefit from the upgrades that will be carried out under these SEAI schemes in 2022.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the local authority retrofit programme in 2022.  This will deliver approximately 2,400 retrofits of local authority homes next year up to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 or cost optimal.  Additionally, the review of the national development plan resulted in an unprecedented level of investment in retrofit.  Some &euro;5 billion of additional carbon tax revenues have been allocated to support residential retrofit to 2030.  This means that the overall allocation for residential retrofit will be approximately &euro;8 billion to 2030.<\/p><p>Alleviating energy poverty is a key consideration in the new national retrofit plan, published as part of the climate action plan last year.  More generally, the Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to improving how energy poverty schemes target those most in need.  As is clear from the supports relating to energy efficiency and the specific measures introduced in budget 2022, the Government is committed to protecting the most vulnerable.  As we transition away from fossil fuels and progressively decarbonise, we must ensure the way we decarbonise captures this unique opportunity to improve the quality of life for all.  Making our homes energy efficient not only means they are warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, but also means we are taking concrete action on social deprivation that is sustainable and enduring.<\/p><p>I will devote my remaining remarks to the subject matter of the Bill.  Notwithstanding the other measures, the Government is determined to act quickly to help people further with these higher energy prices.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a scheme for the purpose of making the electricity cost emergency benefit payment of &euro;100 in 2022.  The moneys for the scheme will be allocated by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communication, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  This amount will not exceed &euro;215 million and will be for the purpose of making a once-off &euro;100 payment by suppliers to each domestic electricity account held by them.  This is on the basis of there being approximately 2.15 million domestic electricity account holders, as indicated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The CRU will provide oversight of the scheme and it will be operated by the distribution system operator, ESB Networks, ESBN.<\/p><p>The mechanism by which the scheme will operate is as follows.  I will provide under regulations for a date, to be known as the relevant date, on which the distribution system operator will calculate the total number of domestic electricity accounts in the State, on the basis of meter point registration numbers, MPRNs.  The MPRN is the unique identifier for all accounts and as such must be used to ensure the &euro;100 payment reaches each account.  ESB Networks will notify me of this number, and this will allow the calculation of the necessary allocation of moneys for the scheme.  On the effective date, which will also be set out by me in regulations, ESB Networks will notify each electricity supplier of the assigned MPRN for each domestic electricity account it supplies.  ESB Networks will also, on the effective date, notify suppliers of the amount of money it will transfer to them for the purposes of the scheme.  I will set out in regulations the period within which ESB Networks will transfer the funds to suppliers for the sole purpose of making payments under the scheme.  Following receipt of these funds, suppliers will then, within the period to be prescribed by me under regulations, credit each domestic electricity account held with them on the effective date with a payment of &euro;100.  The CRU, as an independent regulator, will have oversight of the scheme.  It will put in place administrative and operational arrangements to ensure that ESB Networks and suppliers perform their functions under the scheme.<\/p> <p>The CRU, on the basis of its existing powers to issue directions and secure compliance by licence holders with their obligations, will ensure that ESBN and suppliers perform their functions under the Bill.  Suppliers and the ESBN are required to repay any moneys received by them which have not been used for the purposes of the scheme.<\/p> <p> I would now like to refer to some particular aspects of the scheme that will be of interest to Deputies more broadly.  The scheme will apply to all domestic electricity account holders, including pay-as-you-go customers.  With the support of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, my Department is working closely with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to ensure that those due the payment in rented accommodation receive it.  I understand that there are approximately 300,000 tenancies registered with the RTB and that the majority of these tenants either hold their own electricity accounts or pay their landlord for their electricity on the basis of an actual bill and would therefore receive the benefit directly.  My Department is working with the RTB on a public information campaign to ensure that any tenants, expected to be a small minority, for whom electricity costs are not separate from overall rental cost are aware of the scheme and entitlements.  In that context, in the event that a dispute should arise between a tenant and landlord, there are existing dispute resolution mechanisms provided by the RTB.  The scheme can only become operational following the passing of this underpinning legislation.  As Deputies will appreciate, this emergency measures Bill aims to ensure that the credit can be made to domestic electricity account holders as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> The scheme will apply to every domestic electricity account holder using their unique MPRN to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills.  This does mean that premises, other than principal residences such as holiday homes with a domestic electricity account will be included in the scheme.  The scheme uses the above single eligibility criteria to enable payments to be made at the earliest possible opportunity in 2022.  The scheme does not have additional eligibility criteria.  For example, it is not means tested because the application of such criteria would override the automatic nature of the current scheme, require input from customers through formal applications and cross checking by administrators, which would significantly delay the roll out of the payments.  Therefore, the automatic crediting of all residential customer accounts is the most effective immediate term methodology.<\/p> <p> The CRU has advised that to implement the scheme in the timeframe required, suppliers will use existing billing systems to process the credit.  The CRU has considered the question of an opt-out for people who do not wish to receive the payment.  However, the scale of work required to the billing system would be of an order that would significantly delay the issuing of this payment to all electricity users.  While I do appreciate people's views on this, I also feel it is important to move ahead with administering the scheme so that people receive their payments as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> I will provide a section-by-section summary of the Bill.  There are ten sections.  Section 1 is a standard provision which provides for definitions.<\/p> <p> Section 2 provides for the establishment of the scheme, to be operated on a once-off basis.  It also provides the basis for the estimation of the amount required, as well as for the allocation of the moneys for the scheme up to &euro;215 million, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides the legislative basis for the transfer of the moneys, to be &euro;100 for each domestic electricity account in the State, for the operation of the scheme by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to the distribution system operator.<\/p> <p> Sections 4 and 5 provide for the functions of the distribution system operator and suppliers, respectively, for the purposes of the operation of the scheme.  Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act to create functions for the CRU, including for the purposes of oversight of the functions of the distribution system operator and suppliers, and to ensure that the administrative and operational arrangements necessary for the functioning of the scheme are in place.<\/p> <p> Section 7 deals with an amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This amendment is to exempt the electricity costs emergency benefit payment from income tax.<\/p> <p> Section 8 provides for the Minister to make regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to set out the dates and period for the operation of the scheme as well as to provide for additional functions of the distribution system operator, electricity suppliers, and such administrative and operational matters as may be required for the efficient operation of the scheme.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides that the distribution system operator and electricity suppliers shall bear their own expenses.  Section 10 contains standard provisions concerning the Short Title and commencement of the legislation.<\/p> <p> I have outlined the main provisions of this emergency measures Bill and provided additional detail on the sections.  I hope that this will be of assistance to Deputies.  I look forward to an informed and meaningful debate and to working constructively with Deputies on all sides of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300043#TT00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643903100,"counter":440,"content":"<p>We move now to a Sinn F&eacute;in slot.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  People are facing real hardship in their day-to-day lives with inflation and runaway living costs  The Government has sat on its hands and allowed the cost-of-living crisis to grow, and indeed it has contributed to it.  Rents have been spiralling out of control for years and the Government has done nothing.  The Government has failed to address high childcare costs for parents and inflation is outpacing wage growth to no end.  Each year the Government hikes tax on energy and then wonders why people are struggling to heat their homes.  These policy failures are now coming together into a crippling cost-of-living crisis.  The Government is completely out of touch with reality and is either unwilling or unable to take the necessary action to tackle the costs that are having a detrimental impact on workers and families across the State.<\/p>  <p>  Of course the &euro;100 electricity discount is welcome, but it will not make a dent in the financial challenge households are facing.  It does not go far enough.  Everyone knows that, including apparently the Government, if leaks from parliamentary party meetings in morning news reports are anything to go by.  The T&aacute;naiste acknowledged as much on Leaders' Questions earlier.  Budget 2022 did not go far enough to protect people.  The Government says it is making plans to do something about it.  There has been talk from the Government to the effect of \"If we knew then what we know now\", but the truth is the Government did know then what it knows now because Sinn F&eacute;in and many others were shouting it from the rooftops.  I raised it with the Minister of State three times in the previous term alone on Priority Questions, starting in July.  Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget set out enhanced payments in social welfare, fuel allowance and a utility debt discretionary fund.  The Government failed to heed any of it.  The EU introduced its toolkit in October in recognition of the crisis and giving a green light to do something about it.  Two months later, in the days before Christmas, the Government said it had a plan.  Here we are on 3 February hoping that people might get grace to the value of &euro;100 in a month or two.  Families are in crisis and it is deepening one.  When someone sounds the alarm in October you do not respond by saying I will see you in March or April.  We know that inflation hits the poorest hardest and that the CSO's data are not reflective of this.  We do not have accurate data on fuel poverty because this Government and that which preceded it failed to design measures for it.  Anyone who bothers to listen knows that families have been put to the pin of their collars and beyond.  They are in crisis and this Government knowingly delayed action.  The &euro;100 is welcome but it does not go anywhere near far enough.  Much more needs to be done to help people.  This Bill, if suitably amended, can act as a start, albeit a very late one.<\/p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are not happy with the current draft of the Bill and we have submitted numerous amendments for consideration on Committee Stage.  In the first instance, we are concerned that this Bill is drafted in such a way as to permit only one payment.  That does not reflect the crisis we are in.  A once-off discount is short-sighted and it is clear that more needs to be done.  There are no indications that the energy price hikes are going to stop any time soon.  With political instability in Ukraine and Russia, international gas prices could increase further this year.  Our amendments would give the Minister power to make further payments to households, removing the need for more primary legislation down the line and ensuring that it could be done quickly.<\/p>  <p>  We also want to see the Minister target these payments to households who need it most.  The lack of targeting is a major weakness.  This Bill is a very blunt instrument that will see millions of euro transferred to individuals who, relatively speaking, have no financial worries.  It will see millionaires and others who do not need financial help get &euro;100 from the taxpayer, while those who really need extra help will, in real and relative terms, still be below the water.  We would like to see provision for those who want to forgo the payment have the option of surrendering their payment to a charity that supports and helps those living in energy poverty.  It is far from an ideal approach, but it is an attempt to make this legislation better, by trying to direct payments to those most in need.<\/p>  <p>  We believe holiday homes should be excluded.  We cannot have a situation where a person who is lucky enough to own two homes gets &euro;200 while a family living on the bread line can only access half that amount.<\/p> <p> I welcome some of the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, but we believe protection is needed for renters in this Bill.  Some tenants' energy bills are managed by their landlord or a property management company.  We do not want to see a situation where the credit is applied to bills but the savings are not passed on to the tenant.  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward an amendment seeking to ensure the &euro;100 payment is passed on to renters and providing for a right to access a dispute mechanism.<\/p> <p> On a related point, I draw the Minister of State's attention to the issue of Travellers' access to the &euro;100 credit.  Will the Minister outline how this credit will apply to Travellers living on halting sites?  The local authorities are the electricity account holder in many cases and families make payments to their local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister of State will revert to me on that later.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Minister of State to engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on the level of need for assistance with heating and electricity costs it is experiencing to ascertain the need for a discretionary fund to assist those in utility debt and target those who need additional support most.  We called for such a discretionary fund in budget 2022 in addition to proposing to allocate &euro;30 million to extend the fuel allowance eligibility.  Like other positive proposals, however, it was not taken on board.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the Committee Stage debate.  I encourage the Minister of State and Department to take on board Opposition proposals.  There is an opportunity to improve on the legislation.  Sinn F&eacute;in will put forward constructive amendments, as will others in the Opposition.  The Minister of State and Department should take them on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300044#UU00300","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643903700,"counter":443,"content":"<p>The rising cost of energy and the overall costs of living are on the minds of everybody.  When meeting residents and community groups, whether it is in Donnybrook, the inner city or Rathmines, we see that everybody is feeling the pressure as costs continue to rise.  In the 12 months to December, inflation reached its highest level in 20 years.  These high levels of inflation impact heavily on the daily lives of people in the State.  We know who feels these sharp increases in inflation most.  It is the working families who are hit hardest.  These households must spend a higher proportion of their income on food and fuel.  The cost of electricity has increased by 22%, the cost of gas is up 28% and home heating oil costs have risen by a staggering 53%.  More families will be faced with the painful decision of having to choose between heating the house and feeding themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Measures must be taken by the Government to rein in inflation increases.  While some factors may be outside of the Government's control, others certainly are not.  The Government needs to step in to protect families from poverty.  Provisions must be put in place to support low and middle income families.  If the Government stands by, inflation and energy price spikes will push working families into poverty.  We need to see meaningful actions, including the expansion of the fuel allowance scheme and the extension of the fuel allowance season by a further two weeks.  The eligibility threshold for the allowance also needs to be increased by 10% to include approximately 30,000 additional homes.  These are not radical measures but they will make a positive impact on many who are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  Already, several EU member states such as France, Italy and Spain have taken decisive action to reduce the burden of these price hikes on ordinary people.  In Spain, consumers will see their average monthly bill drop by 22%.  The market has failed to provide lower and more competitive prices for consumers.  The Government must intervene in a meaningful way to ease the burden on the public.  We cannot allow its market-led approach to continue.  The Government needs to seek a special derogation to remove VAT on household energy bills.  Such a move would reduce household bills by 12%.  This would greatly ease the burden on so many people and give workers and their families a much-needed break.<\/p>  <p>  In housing, the market-led approach backed by the policies of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il has also failed.  This approach and these policies have caused the housing crisis to worsen by the month.  The increases in the cost of living are a direct result of those two parties' policies.  For many, the idea of owning a home seems impossible.  This does devastating damage to communities, families and couples wanting to start a family.  The rising cost of renting swallows a large chunk of most people's salaries and many feel suffocated by all of these rising costs.  We need a ban on rent increases and rents need to be brought under control.  Measures such as a refundable tax credit, equivalent to one month's rent and capped at &euro;1,500, would be a good start.  It would give renters a much-needed break.  We need to see this Government standing up for ordinary working families, not standing idly by.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300045#VV00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1643903700,"counter":444,"content":"<p>We are all acutely aware of the issues arising from the increases in the cost of living and the impact these have had in recent months.  We have had debate after debate on this issue in the Chamber in recent weeks.  We need to see strong action to help those who are struggling most.  We have all seen the impact of the increases in the costs of electricity and fuel in our electricity bills.  I am sure many of us got our electricity bill through the door and were surprised at the significant rise in the bills.  We also see it at the petrol pumps.<\/p><p>The impact on lower income households has been catastrophic.  It is a cause of concern and distress and there are things they must do without.  These increases in prices mean they simply do not have additional spare cash lying around to help them to pay for this.  All Members are seeing this in our clinics and when knocking on doors.  I hold a weekly clinic and I knock on doors every week.  The main issue that keeps coming up is that people are just not able to pay for things.  One man told me this week that he had to sleep in the kitchen to keep warm.  He cannot use the shower in the winter months because the bathroom is the coldest room in his house so he must use an alternative place for showering.  That is a cold, hard fact.  Many of us would find it unimaginable to have to go through that ourselves.<\/p><p>This problem is not completely new.  In November 2021, my colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, conducted a survey to which 14,000 people responded.  Any Members who have conducted surveys will know that getting 14,000 respondents shows how live an issue this is.  Of those who responded, 93% said they had seen a massive increase in energy prices.  Of the 6,000 comments in the survey there are two statements I particularly want to read to the Minister of State.  One person said:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tAs a pensioner, I can&rsquo;t live on what&rsquo;s left [each week].  I pay my electricity by card at An Post.  I can&rsquo;t afford groceries and eat the bare minimum.  Life is very hard.  <\/blockquote>  <p>Another said:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tCurrently battling with high anxiety because I don&rsquo;t know if I will be able to pay rent\/electricity every month or pay for diesel.  I&rsquo;m a single mother of a 10 yr old boy &hellip; and on his Santa list he asked Santa to help his Mam be OK.  Even my 10 yr old son can see I&rsquo;m not OK any more.  <\/blockquote>  <p>This is the reality.  We need strong and urgent action from the Government.  We need to see a ban on rent increases and one month's rent going back into the renters' pockets.

We have areas with a high percentage of elderly people and other areas that have a young population, with young families, single parents and so on.  The constituency also has areas of economic disadvantage with high unemployment rates and families struggling to put food on the table for their children.  There are also areas of the constituency that are more affluent.  A number of voluntary groups in Dublin North-West work to alleviate the everyday stresses of struggling families by providing them with food parcels, clothes for their children and other essentials.  Ocras &Eacute;ire is one such group that does tremendous work, helping families and individuals who are homeless or struggling to provide the most basic needs for their children.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most important things to provide for your family, apart from food, is a warm and comfortable home.  For this to happen, it is essential for families and households to have access to an affordable supply of electricity or gas.  Under normal circumstances, people in more vulnerable communities find it difficult to provide a consistent, economical or inexpensive form of energy, not just to heat their houses and apartments, but also to cook food and provide hot water for the household.  It is now proving a real challenge for many families in my constituency to provide such a necessity and it greatly affects people's health and quality of life, especially the elderly.<\/p>  <p>  The avalanche of price increases for electricity and gas since last year is set to continue into 2022.<\/p> <p>This is grim news for low-income families and the unemployed who have been finding it difficult, to say the least, to make ends meet.  The high rate of inflation, currently at 5.4%, is a 20-year high.  Families that are already paying exorbitant energy bills will continue to do so for the foreseeable future with ever-increasing electricity and gas bills.  According to Money Guide Ireland, a customer of Electric Ireland, the biggest electricity provider, would have an annual bill of &euro;1,274 based on the average usage of 4,200 kW a year.  Of course there would be an increase in the use of electricity during winter with the increased use of heaters and household utilities such as tumble dryers and washing machines.  Electricity bills for winter would obviously be higher than in summer.<\/p> <p> The Government proposes that all electricity customers, including pay-as-you-go customers, will receive a once-off payment of &euro;100 off their energy bill, which will be automatically applied to their accounts.  While this is welcome, the proposed payment is a drop in the ocean compared to the high energy bills households are already paying.  It will make little difference to those vulnerable individuals and families who have to make the choice between heating the house or putting food on the table.  The present arrangement that exists for people who are on disability allowance, old age pensions and other qualifying welfare payments is that they receive a discount of &euro;35 a month on their energy costs.  There are other similar allowances that can be availed of.  I urge the Minister to increase such allowances substantially, particularly in view of the massive impact these energy bill increases are having on some of the most vulnerable in society.  Realistically the once-off payment of &euro;100 will not cushion the blow such increases in energy bills will have on these vulnerable people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300045#VV00400","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643904300,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I have to be quite frank.  When I saw this proposal initially, I thought the Government really needs to try harder.  This does nothing to tackle the spiralling energy costs and multiple price hikes over the last year.  While it might take the edge off the winter electricity bill, it will do nothing for the ones coming after that.  We know that the spiralling cost of living in this country is leaving those most vulnerable behind and leaving them in a significant amount of debt.  CSO figures show the annual rate of inflation was at a 20-year high last month.  That is mostly made up of jumps in costs of energy, transport and rent.<\/p><p>I spoke to a constituent this week who by chance found a shopping receipt from last year for her lunches for her children every week.  Every single item on that receipt had gone up, some by a couple of cent and some by considerably more.  That is the impact that people are feeling every single day.  The finances are simply not there to meet that ever-increasing cost of living.  They are under real pressure.  They need to see from Government realistic, long-term solutions that are much more far-reaching than &euro;100 off the next electricity bill.<\/p><p>I want to raise another issue in respect of the universal aspect of this payment and wants versus needs.  We have all come across that at some point.  I do not know one person sitting in this Chamber who needs this payment.  I can think of vast numbers of people in my constituency who need it.  I will leave it up to Deputies' own moral compass as to whether they want this payment.  There is nothing here about surrendering that money if we make the decision that we do not need it.<\/p><p>There is nothing in this that deals with holiday homes.  My constituents will struggle to put food on the table, a roof over their heads and shoes on their kids' feet but another individual in a financial position to own two properties will get this payment twice.  There is gross inequity in that as surely the Minister of State sees.  I also ask that the Minister of State engage meaningfully with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It does tremendous work in communities the length and breadth of this country.  It too are under substantial pressure from people coming to it in dire straits because of utility bill debt.  Will the Minister of State engage with it?<\/p><p>We have heard the fuel allowance bandied about on media in recent days.  The fuel allowance needs reform but while the Government is focusing on those who receive the allowance, it is completely disregarding those who do not qualify for it, who are ineligible but still have to put food on the table and a roof over their heads and still have that ESB bill coming in the door.

As we are coming through the crisis of the pandemic, the Government has to confront the twin crises of the climate emergency and the cost of living crisis, which has manifested so strikingly and seriously for so many families, households and individuals across the country.<\/p>  <p>  While we accept that this is well meaning and that households will welcome the rebate proposed in the Bill, we are of the view that it is simply insufficient and inadequate to deal with the reality of the spiralling cost of living.  We know that households are expecting, on electricity and gas alone, more than &euro;400 of an increase on their bill this year following the price increases imposed.  We know there are soaring costs associated with housing, rental, childcare, even in purchasing food and groceries.  It is deeply disappointing to see Government putting forward this drop in the ocean.  If I may mix metaphors, it is clutching at straws in putting forward this drop in the ocean as a way to address the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed if what we are hearing in terms of leaks from the Minister of State's colleagues' parliamentary party meeting last night is correct, it appears both the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste agree with our analysis that the measure as proposed in the Bill is not enough to address the cost of living crisis.  It is not enough of an answer.  Much more needs to be done.  We are hearing all sorts of kites being flown as to what can be done by Government.  It is very disappointing to see that all we are getting by way of concrete proposals and legislation is a &euro;100 rebate.  It is tokenistic.  It seems somewhat random if I may say so.  It is certainly not a targeted or strategic way to address the reality of increased costs of living for so many people.<\/p>  <p>  This view is shared by so many of our constituents.  Looking at my own emails from constituents in Dublin Bay South today, a constituent writes that she is a working mother with a two year old son.  She and her husband both work.  They are writing to a public representative for the first time ever, out of pure desperation.  I know the Minister of State is hearing it in his own constituency as we all are.  They have been involved in what she describes as excruciating bidding wars with insane prices in housing.  They are trying to buy a house.  They are both earning, they have relatively good incomes but they cannot afford a home.  We are hearing from people renting about increased costs of rental.  We are hearing from people who themselves are not struggling but who are incensed.  A constituent wrote to me today saying they are growing more and more annoyed about the communications about the &euro;100 rebate and pointing out that this initiative will cost the Government over &euro;200 million, which could be spent in a significantly better way.  My constituent describes it as a populist reactive gesture which does not help those who are in genuine poverty or genuine fuel poverty.  That really sums up what we all on the Opposition benches are hearing in constituents and members of the public as to their view on this measure.<\/p>  <p>  We accept that there are issues beyond the Government's control driving up the cost of living.  The Russian aggression on the borders of Ukraine is clearly a case in point.  Yet there is much more that can be done at domestic level through legislation or other policy interventions to address the cost of living and the impact that international issues like the Russian aggression are having on individuals and households.  We are saying that the Government can do more to address the scale of the crisis.  For example, one of the key reasons the cost of living and rise in fuel prices are hitting so hard is that wages have not risen.  Here is a way of addressing this.  Let us look at how we can address the wage issue.<\/p> <p>We know that people on low pay and those in receipt of the minimum wage are the most affected of all by increases in the cost of living where they have seen no commensurate increases in their incomes.  Here is one alternative way the Government can address this, namely, by increasing Ireland's minimum wage of &euro;10.50 per hour to an hourly living wage of &euro;12.90.  Instead, we see a measure that is simply not strategic, not targeted and, therefore, not enough to address the cost of living for people.<\/p> <p> The Bill is flawed in its approach to renters in particular.  We will table amendments on that, as will others.  Looking again at my constituency of Dublin Bay South, as many as 44% of all properties there are private rentals.  That is a very large proportion of households in my constituency and my local area.  In the south inner city, Portobello, Ranelagh, Rathmines and other areas in the constituency, we see large numbers of individuals and families renting.  The lack of integration of renters into the proposed statutory framework of the Bill is concerning.  The Minister of State addressed this in his speech.  We would welcome copies of the speech in order that we might look at that.  He stated that he hopes to work with, I think, the RTB on this issue.  The figures we have show that as many as half or more of households that rent will have their landlord's details on the electricity bill.  That needs to addressed because while clearly it is to be hoped that landlords will pass on the small saving in bills to renters, we cannot guarantee that.<\/p> <p> As I understand it, there is an absence of safeguarding measures in the Bill.  The Bill looks at fuel prices, but let us look at the crisis in the cost of living in other areas.  Let us hear from the Government about measures to address that.  Daft.ie tells us that rents are rising at an annual rate of 6.8% and that Dublin is the sixth most expensive capital city in the world for renters.  The average rent for a one-bed unit in my constituency is &euro;1,643 per month.  Let us contrast that with stagnant wages and low pay.  The only capital cities which can compete with ours on rent are cities like Hong Kong, Singapore, Washington and London.  We need to ensure that renters are getting adequate safeguards.  The Bill clearly does not go anywhere near addressing the issue of rent increases, but let us ensure at the very least that savings on energy bills are passed on to renters.  That is a key issue.<\/p> <p> I hope the Government will work with me and with my colleague, Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, to see our renters' rights Bill passed.  That Bill would deal with three key issues that clearly impact renters' experience and quality of life, including security of tenure and the cost of rent.  We are calling for a three-year rent freeze and for measures to be passed to give renters greater rights to quality life and things like the right to rent an unfurnished apartment or home, which is the norm in other European cities.  Our Bill would also end no-fault evictions and restrict the grounds on which a landlord can end a tenancy.  What we are seeking is greater protections for renters.  That in itself, particularly that three-year rent freeze, will help to address the cost of living for many, ensuring then that rents are capped and that renters have greater security.<\/p> <p> I have talked to constituents, especially those who are coming to Ireland from other countries to work and who are appalled at the lack of protection for renters here compared with their own countries.  I am told that the norm in other European cities is a three-year rental agreement.  Why are we in Ireland wedded to 12-month leases?  That gives nobody security.  It does not give private landlords security either.  I know we have many so-called accidental landlords, and I hear from many constituents in that position too.  Why not move to that European norm of a three-year lease as the legal basis for rental agreements?  We need to look really carefully at how we can protect renters better and ensure that we target cost of living increases in rental and tenancy costs.  That is a key issue that is causing so much hardship across the country, particularly in our cities.<\/p> <p> Last week, the Labour Party put forward a motion on the cost of living which sought to create or to propose a broader package of measures to ensure we address some of these issues - not just energy prices but also issues such as the price of accommodation, rent and house purchase.  We put that motion forward also in a context in which we have seen from Oxfam figures showing that there has been a significant increase of wealth for a very small number of individuals in our society.  Those figures were very striking and show that the wealth of Ireland's nine billionaires had increased by nearly 60% since March 2020 while most people have seen incomes and wages stagnate and the cost of rent, fuel and food increase.  With all the talk and all the really admirable solidarity we have seen as we have gone through the Covid pandemic and the public health restrictions required by it, it is frustrating to read of these figures, particularly when we know how much fuel and energy prices are rising, how much childcare costs are rising and how much rent has risen for so many.  That context makes this proposed measure feel tokenistic.  It requires us to put forward a systematic approach to reducing the cost of living in all areas.  That is what we sought to do in our motion last week.  We were very disappointed the Government did not accept the motion in the good faith and the constructive spirit in which it was offered.<\/p> <p> Among the measures we put forward were the introduction of an emergency energy costs relief package for households.  We called for targeted support for those in energy poverty through the widening of access to the fuel allowance and the introduction of a refundable carbon tax credit for low-income households.  We had proposed that measure in our alternative budget last October, so it is not a new idea but, rather, something we believe would offer a much more targeted way of addressing rising fuel costs.  It would offer practical support to people while supporting the phasing out in the longer term of fossil fuels, a much more realistic approach to the task at hand than an effective subsidy of fossil fuels.  Ours is a measure that seeks to address the other crisis I have mentioned, which, I know, the Minister of State and his party are very aware of, namely the climate crisis and the crisis of rising carbon emissions.  We also call for a windfall levy to be imposed on excessive profits made in the energy sector to offset rising prices.  We have seen such a measure introduced in other jurisdictions recently.  That would look at targeting not only the cost-of-living crisis but also that key crisis of the climate.<\/p> <p> I wish to locate the debate on the cost of living and this debate within the context of that climate crisis.  It sometimes feels as if there is a rather disjointed approach to policy on the part of the Government.  We heard of that disjointed or disconnected approach in the leaks from the parliamentary party meetings of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael last night, with apparently different views being put forward by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste as to how to address the cost of living, whether to increase the rebate or look at other measures.  We are all agog, waiting to see what will come out of that.  It is a disjointed approach, however.  We see that disconnection even more when we try to link the climate crisis with the cost-of-living crisis.  Let us not forget that in November and December there was a period of about six weeks when we were in this Chamber several times per week, rightly, discussing Ireland's need to meet its ambitious climate targets.  I and my party support the Government in seeking to meet those ambitious targets and we support the carbon tax, but we are disappointed to see a lack of joined-up thinking when we see measures such as this come from the Government without commensurate measures to address the climate crisis, which has not gone away just because we are focusing on inflation in this debate.  While being conscious that inflation is at a 20-year high, we need to ensure that the measures we are taking to address that crisis for people will also match the measures we take on the climate crisis.  For example, a number of people around the country availed of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, better energy warmer homes scheme for smaller insulation projects many years ago but are now seeking to undertake further works which would have the effect of reducing energy costs for people while also reducing emissions.  Many people are excluded from the scheme because a period of ten years has not yet passed since the initial project.  That is problematic.  It would be easy for the Government to fix that.  Doing so would address both climate and cost-of-living issues.<\/p> <p> Last month, I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to ask if he would amend the SEAI rules on the one home, one visit restriction on the warmer homes scheme to allow homeowners to reapply for works that were not supported by grants in the 2014 scheme, such as external wall insulation on houses in which the walls are solid and therefore ineligible, and if he would consider loosening that problematic ten-year limit.  The Minister, in his reply, revealed that there were no such plans to ease the burden on lower income households, which are particularly vulnerable to energy poverty.  I would like to hear more from the Minister of State about the logic of that decision.  It simply does not seem logical to me and does not seem to connect with a joined up approach to Government thinking.  I am conscious that Ireland is very far off our retrofitting target of 50,000 and that there is a need to accelerate rapidly the rate at which we are enabling people to retrofit homes.  Lots of measures are being taken at ground level to address this.<\/p> <p> Just last Friday I had the pleasure of officiating at a graduation ceremony for a group of people who had just finished an intensive programme in construction skills.<\/p> <p>It was being run by the brilliant people at St. Andrew's Resource Centre on Pearse Street in co-operation with a range of State agencies, including the Dublin Port Company, which supplied the land for the course to be run.  The organisers of the course, which has an excellent 63% job placement rate, are putting together a course on retrofitting and green homes with a view to upskilling sufficient numbers of people to undertake the smaller scale retrofitting projects that will make a difference to many individuals and households experiencing energy poverty.  It will also make a major difference to meeting our domestic climate targets for households.<\/p> <p> The inspirational approach being taken by those involved in this training programme is admirable and they have been supported by Ministers and Deputies from across the parties, yet they are scrabbling for funding to continue the programme.  This is just one example of where we see initiatives that would greatly assist in addressing fuel poverty issues and the climate crisis but where we do not see joined-up Government thinking in supporting them.<\/p> <p> We are proposing measures at national level through the D&aacute;il.  We are also looking for Government support for local initiatives.  We believe that this sort of joined-up thinking would be preferable to the tokenistic, scattergun or even confetti approach that is being taken with the sort of measure before the House today.  We need to see more targeted measures to tackle the cost of living.  I cannot say that enough.  We need to see radical measures like a three-year rent freeze, cuts to public transport prices and the carbon tax credit proposed in our budget.  These are the types of measure that will make a real difference.<\/p> <p> We must be conscious that the reality of low pay and job insecurity for many people is being exaggerated by the current inflation figures.  That is the stark context of the &euro;100 rebate.  It is inadequate when contrasted with average heating price increases of more than &euro;770 or when considered in light of data from the Parliamentary Budget Office suggesting that inflation will offset increases in the contributory State pension such that the purchasing power the pension carries will decrease.<\/p> <p> Given that we are in a context of rising inflation and we are conscious of the reality of low pay and job insecurity for far too many, the more targeted package of measures that we are calling for needs to be adopted by the Government so that people do not have to make a call between paying for food and paying for energy, which is the reality for too many.  We need to see more ambitious, more targeted and more strategic approaches from the Government, approaches that show joined-up thinking and a co-ordinated tackling of the two giant crises facing us, namely, the climate emergency and the crisis that is being felt by all too many in the cost of living and spiralling increases in rents, housing costs, fuel, food and, indeed, childcare, which is an issue on which I hope we will see radical measures being taken by the Government.  We will be pushing for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300046#WW00300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643905500,"counter":451,"content":"<p>This legislation is the Government's response to the excessive costs and burdens being placed on households by electricity bills.  It might be a welcome reprieve for the moment at a cost of &euro;215 million, but it does little to guarantee that we will not be here again throwing hundreds of millions of euro more of taxpayers' money at meeting bills that are far too excessive and well in excess, I might add, of genuine contributing factors like international gas prices.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated in the D&aacute;il and media commentary, I have deep concerns about the ESB.  In the first half of 2021 while businesses throughout the country struggled and hundreds of thousands of people fought to survive on the pandemic unemployment payment, the ESB announced an increase of &euro;114 million in operating profits.  Before exceptional items, its operating profit was &euro;363 million.  Equinor, one of the world&rsquo;s largest players in the energy market, has pulled out of a joint arrangement with the ESB, seemingly unable to make things work in Ireland.  I have challenged the ESB on several fronts - questioning its role in energy costs, how public service obligations benefit it and how it is regulated - and sought an investigation into manipulation of the energy market.  Most of all, I cannot understand how we have arrived at a situation where there is such a grave lack of energy security in a country that is brimming with energy sources.  I have decided to take these ESB and regulatory issues to the European Union for a state aid investigation and to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for an investigation of the ESB's price hikes in the wholesale energy market, which impact thereafter on householders.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, our State has proven unable to oversee the ESB.  We do not seem to have been able to supervise or regulate it properly.  We have also failed in developing new forms of energy supply.  We know that renewable generation accounts for 40% of the energy grid, but the majority of those renewables are land-based wind projects, and when the wind stops blowing we can see its impact on the wholesale energy market and, consequently, household energy bills.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the European Commission will now ensure that the ESB is properly overseen and regulated.  Since EU regulation will ensure a functioning company and market for the consumer, it will not be in the State's interests to continue to own the ESB.  It has served a useful purpose over the decades and has been an asset for the State, but the time has come to have a debate on its ownership.  The State has often been a pointless owner of assets and a terrible shareholder.  It has also been unable to supervise the companies it owns, either lacking the technical people to see what its businesses are doing or the powers to curb them.  Ownership is no longer the key determinant of how dominant companies operate.  Rather, proper regulation is, and that is what the EU will insist upon.  We should sell the company off and use the money to power our move into offshore wind and other industries for a green future.  Of course, staff and other interested parties should be allowed to participate in the sale's proceeds, but the bulk must be used to invest in the future and ensure that we have a functioning energy market.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of a rich supply of sustainable energy will be the great commodity of the future.  Ireland has potential in abundance and needs to maximise its geography to its advantage in the world.  It is then that we will be sure that legislation such as this will not be necessary again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300048#YY00200","speaker":"1591"},{"type":"speech","time":1643905500,"counter":452,"content":"<p>This Bill is an emergency benefits scheme to give relief to families that have been victims of significant price increases across the board.  Recently in my constituency, we held an online meeting of people who were concerned about the cost of living crisis they were facing.  It could be broken down into a number of areas.  Energy was one of the main ones - we are trying to do something practical about it today - but the major one was the cost of housing.  Rent in particular is a significant problem for people, as is the cost of childcare.  For people living in rural areas who must travel to work, fuel is a significant problem.  Its cost has gone through the roof.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get a grip on this situation and recognise that the Government has to play an active role and try to support people through this period.  I hope that it will be a short period.  A concern I have about this Bill is that it is one-off legislation.  We are going to the trouble of creating a Bill for a one-off payment when we should instead be providing for a regulation to allow this payment to be repeated if a similar crisis arises in future.  Doing this would not place any extra cost on the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is a blunt instrument that gives the payment to everyone, even people who are well off and do not need it.  An amendment could be made so that people in those circumstances could divert their payments to charities, which would then disburse the money to people in greater need of it.<\/p> <p>I take slight issue with Deputy Cowen's proposal regarding the ESB.  I have bad memories of Eircom, as will many of us who bought shares that ended up being worth nothing.  We were told at the time that the only way to get broadband provision was to privatise the company and that the State was the block.  Of all things, it was broadband that we could not get a hold of at that time.  Here we are today in a very similar position.  Nothing has changed.  Before the State considers doing anything with the very valuable assets and companies that have been built up by hard work over many generations, any such move needs to be thought out very carefully.  The mistakes of the past in that regard should never be repeated.  While regulation may play a role in all of that, at the end of the day, we need hands-on State control of the company in an island economy like ours, which does not have access to neighbours that can provide energy to us as freely as would be the case if we had land borders with them.  It would be a very retrograde step to go in the proposed direction.<\/p> <p> To go back to the Bill, we support it but it does not go nearly far enough to deal with the many problems people have.  At the least, it needs to be recognised that the one thing we could do very simply, and which I implore the Government and Minister to do, is to amend the legislation to allow this measure to be repeated in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300048#YY00300","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643906100,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I have some detailed comments to make about this Bill but first I must say that I find it alarming that there are calls from the Government backbenches to sell off and privatise the ESB.  Given the issues we face in terms of energy security, our climate change challenges and the cost of living, which we are now discussing, any proposals to sell off or privatise the ESB need to be strongly opposed.  Privatisation would be a disaster for this country.  Privatising Telecom &Eacute;ireann was an absolute disaster.  We would now have broadband in public ownership and rolled out nationally, which is needed for economic and social reasons, if the disastrous decision to privatise Eircom had not been taken years ago to the benefit, of course, of the people who made money out of that privatisation process.  Privatisation of core public services, including energy supply and security, has been a disaster in other countries.  We should not be following any proposals or suggestions to do likewise here.  I strongly oppose those calls.  I call on the Government Ministers and every party in this House to oppose them as well.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill.  The fact that this is an emergency measures Bill says a lot about how the Government has responded to rising energy costs, energy poverty and our future energy needs.  There have been adequate opportunities for the Government to intervene ahead of rises in energy costs to establish short-term solutions such as income supports while adequately resourcing and funding long-term solutions such as a strategy for combating energy poverty, none of which has been done to date.  My colleague, Deputy Whitmore, raised the need for D&aacute;il statements on rising energy costs back in September, when rising energy costs were first predicted.  That was more than four months ago.  My colleagues in the Social Democrats and I have since consistently called for short-term income supports to support people and help buffer them from rising energy prices, pre-empting the cliff that many families could face far into the winter months.  In all of that time, energy prices have shot up, with household electricity costs rising by approximately 70% from late 2020 to the end of last year.  Some estimates calculate that these hikes have added an additional &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,300 to the average home's yearly expenses.  This is nearly twice as high as previous calculations of approximately &euro;700.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Democrats has also called for families in receipt of the working family payment to be eligible for the fuel allowance and for the widening of the criteria for the means-tested energy components of the household benefits package.  Unfortunately, the Government only saw fit to widen eligibility for fuel allowance to jobseekers who have been on the payment for more than 12 months, down from 15 months.  Furthermore, basic social welfare payments only increased by &euro;5 in budget 2022.  There were no attempts to increase the qualified child payment to assist families with children, among other social welfare-related supports.  As short-term measures go, these do not go far enough nor are they in line with the extent to which energy prices are increasing.<\/p>  <p>  We also called for a moratorium on utility disconnections.  While this was not granted, my colleague, Deputy Whitmore, did speak with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which confirmed the range of measures in place to help people struggling to pay their bills.  These include switching supplier, engaging with the company, placing their name on a priority list of people suffering from a medical condition and engaging with the social welfare community officer for discretionary payment if they could not pay an upcoming bill.  Of course, these are not sufficient and it is hard for people to negotiate these measures.  Instead of applying a range of other short-term measures, the Government sharply focused its energy on a once-off emergency stopgap measure, which is really more about delaying and scrambling than reacting properly.<\/p>  <p>  This payment is cited as being one of a suite of measures to mitigate the effects of the recent significant rises in electricity prices, which includes support through the social protection system.  It is a mystery as to what this suite of measures actually comprises when existing supports have not been increased to the extent required in this situation.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the payment is not targeted.  According to the last census, there are 62,000 holiday homes in Ireland.  Under the Government's current plan to issue &euro;100 credit to every household in the country, more than &euro;6 million will be spent to provide financial assistance to the owners of these homes.  I do not accept the argument that holiday home owners should be in receipt of Government assistance to pay their bills.  I feel more work could have been done to target this payment better towards those who are really struggling with bills at the moment.  The Government has stated that it cannot target this support at those most in need as it would be overly complex to do so.  That contention is dubious given that the scheme was announced in December and the credit will not be paid until March, a period of four months during which a more targeted approach could have been devised.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Whitmore, questioned the request to waive prelegislative scrutiny, through which there would have been an opportunity to look at this in more detail and come up with a solution.  It could have been done quickly and in a timely manner through the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  Was the removal of holiday homes ever considered?  Were ways to make this payment more targeted looked into and, if so, to what extent?<\/p>  <p>  In the long term, we need to think about implementing a new strategy to combat energy poverty.  Such a strategy is nowhere to be seen.  Despite there having already been three strategies to combat poverty, there is no movement on a fourth.  A review is currently being carried out of the implementation of the strategy to combat energy poverty, which the Minister said will be completed in the coming months and will inform the next steps with regard to the development of a new strategy.  My colleague, Deputy Whitmore, submitted a parliamentary question asking for an update.  It was put to her that significant progress had been made since the last strategy was published in 2016.  Most of these commitments relate to increasing funding for numerous retrofitting schemes, many of which are still not operational.  I do not believe this can be counted as progress as it will be years before people get the full benefit of living in warmer homes.  Meanwhile, many people are slipping into the fuel poverty net with little support to keep them afloat.<\/p>  <p>  On this topic, we can address both the financial and environmental cost of high energy prices by making our homes more energy efficient.  Energy-efficient homes help reduce our carbon footprint as they require less fuel to heat but they also help to address fuel poverty.  Despite Government strategies specifically aimed at tackling energy poverty, barriers to accessing grants persist, especially for low-income households.  These are the households that are most likely to use solid fuels such as coal and peat but policies have often sidelined these very households, those that need the most support.  The upfront costs associated with accessing sustainable energy grants act as a barrier for those on low incomes.  Too often, subsidies are only taken up by those who can afford to make the necessary investment.  Retrofitting is a prime example of this.  As those who need them most can often not avail of the grants due to cost, in effect, these subsidies transfer wealth to households on higher incomes.  With more than 230,000 homes having the lowest building energy ratings, F and G, it is imperative that the Government support these households by redesigning these schemes to make them more accessible.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, those living in homes with ratings of F or G have a much higher indicative cost.  In fact, a two-bed apartment with a rating of F or G has an indicative annual cost of &euro;2,400 to &euro;3,000, three to four times the fuel allowance.<\/p> <p>As a household increases in size, so too does the heating cost.  A three-bedroom semi-detached house with a low energy-efficiency rating costs between &euro;3,200 and &euro;4,000 to heat.  The fuel allowance and other social welfare supports are not increasing in line with inflation or energy costs, which means a huge cohort of people is being left behind.  This is completely unacceptable.<\/p> <p> There are other long-term initiatives that the Government needs to focus on better, including those associated with energy demand, renewable energy generation and just transition.  With regard to energy demand and generation, an upgrade of the national grid must be a key element of infrastructural investment so communities, co-operatives, farms and individuals can produce renewable energy and sell what they do not use back to the national grid, thus becoming self-sustaining and contributing to meeting our national targets.<\/p> <p> Our energy infrastructure is not fit for purpose to address the everyday energy needs of people living in Ireland, so it can hardly cater for large-scale projects such as data centres.  In that context, we need to acknowledge the energy demand on an energy system that is wholly antiquated.  The facts speak for themselves.  The annual increase in energy demand from data centres in the past four years was the equivalent of adding 140,000 households to the power system each year.  This is not sustainable and it is now threatening our energy security, investments worth billions of euro, and thousands of jobs.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Jennifer Whitmore, has spoken many times on this issue.  We do not tire of saying we need a strategy to manage the current and future energy demands in respect of data centres.<\/p> <p> Our energy infrastructure needs rapid modernisation to meet not only our energy needs but also our climate action goals.  Our renewed ambition to meet the target of having 80% of our energy generated using renewable resources by 2030 is now aligned with our climate action plan and will require an urgent overhaul of the outdated legislation facilitating the development of offshore wind farms.  There are many wind farms planned for locations off the east coast that will generate a huge amount of green electricity, but the capacity will be threatened if any delays are incurred.<\/p> <p> We need a management strategy to manage current and projected energy demand in Ireland so we can prevent energy price hikes, ensure people can afford the energy they need and assist people with their capacity to adapt to climate change and lower their carbon footprint.  Right now, the Government is expecting individuals to take on too great a burden to adapt to climate change.  They can barely keep afloat considering the current cost of living.  This is an important point if we are to bring people with us, which we need to do.<\/p> <p> With regard to just transition, we are at a crossroads.  We need to start examining and meeting our climate action targets and our reduction targets together because the two go hand in hand.  This will be important in building and maintaining public support in the years to come.  If we do not do that successfully, it will threaten our capacity to have support in meeting our climate action targets.  This is incredibly important.  It should be a priority for all of us, particularly the Government, considering what we need to do by way of climate action in the coming years.  If we do not do so properly, we will put in jeopardy the support for the many actions that will be needed.<\/p> <p> Eliminating energy poverty and protecting people from it should comprise a key pillar of any just transition platform, which many organisations, including Social Justice Ireland, advocate.  Groups such as Social Justice Ireland advocate a wide range of incentives to reflect these priorities and call for a focus on short- and long-term costs of addressing energy poverty for various groups in society.<\/p> <p> The Minister has spoken regularly about just transition when it comes to achieving our climate change and climate action targets; however, these words can sound very hollow unless increases in social welfare payments are introduced to help people to manage the increased burden of rising energy prices, and unless there are supports for people on low incomes in general.<\/p> <p> Significant investment across all platforms must be made to ensure our society meets its climate targets and to have a just transition.  Ireland has significant work to do in this area and has consistently been one of the poorest performers in the European Union in meeting emissions targets.<\/p> <p> To secure energy supply in the future, we need to ramp up renewable energy development and make inroads to reform the current planning regulatory environment.  While it is welcome that moves to provide a scheme for households to sell solar power back to the grid are being progressed, we have an ambitious renewable electricity target to meet.  The climate action plan has set out an ambitious goal of generating up to 80% of electricity from renewables by 2030.  Reform of the Irish planning regulatory environment has been slow and we risk not facilitating the levels of investment needed to meet the renewable energy targets.<\/p> <p> Meanwhile, the Government has complicated matters by prioritising the development of maritime consents without giving equal priority to looking towards Government commitments to expand Ireland&rsquo;s marine protected area network from 2.13% to 30% by 2030.  This will require creating a marine protected-area regime, which requires another major change to current marine environmental protection laws.  Sufficient inroads have not been made to put this on a statutory footing.  It is another example of the crossroads we are at, where our climate action targets are meeting social issues such as energy poverty.  We need to secure our energy for the future through renewables to reduce poverty, but we need to reduce energy poverty without also damaging our environment.  If we do not proceed in this way, we will risk failing to make a socially just transition to a zero-carbon economy.  It is not an easy crossroads to cross but it is certain that an emergency measure like the one we are debating will do nothing to create genuine, tangible pathways for people already in energy poverty, or at risk of poverty, to move towards a socially just zero-carbon economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643906700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The rising cost of living is crippling many people.  Constituents tell me regularly that the day-to-day costs of running a home are becoming unmanageable.  The cost of  electricity is without doubt one of the biggest issues for householders.  The rising cost of electricity is a global trend, a trend that is creating cost-of-living issues right across the world.  Here in Ireland, it is impacting renters, homeowners, young people, and pensioners.  It is affecting ordinary hardworking people, whose salaries or hourly rates are not rising in line with the cost of electricity.  Therefore, I really welcome this emergency measure from the Government to provide a one-off relief payment of &euro;100 towards each household&rsquo;s electricity bill.  This will put &euro;210 million back where it is needed, in people&rsquo;s pockets.<\/p>  <p>  I was contacted by many constituents who welcomed this measure when it was announced in December.  I am really pleased we are able to move on it now.  It has been hard to put together but it is really welcome.  I ask the Minister of State to consider establishing a hardship fund to help families and individuals who may need additional support to meet the rising cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the payment to help with the cost of electricity, I believe we should also be focusing on long-term sustainable options to make electricity more affordable.  Ireland has huge potential to deliver renewable wind energy at a massive scale.  This would give us the opportunity to create new jobs in rural towns and villages along the coast, meaning we would be investing in and renewing those communities.  Ireland could produce 20% of the offshore renewable energy of the entire European Union in 20 or 30 years.  Think about that for a second.  Wind energy could become our biggest contributor to reducing carbon emissions and creating tens of thousands of jobs outside our core cities.  It would mean creating sustainable, affordable energy streams.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, we have one of the world&rsquo;s strongest wave capacities and steady winds, which give us a unique resource, but this resource is not tapped into sufficiently.  That is why I really welcomed the Maritime Area Planning Bill both on Committee Stage and when it was before the D&aacute;il last month.  The Bill will help us to achieve our renewable energy targets for 2030 and bring in a much-needed planning regime for offshore wind.  While I welcome the one-off cost reduction concerning electricity bills, it is really important that we continue to work on developing sustainable electricity provisions.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been contacted by some constituents who have taken steps to retrofit their homes.  They are concerned over the prospect of rising energy costs given that they may be spending more time working from home.<\/p> <p>That is why they have made that sustainable switch.  While it is right for the Government to do whatever is in our power to tackle the rising cost of traditional energy, it is also an opportunity for us to encourage homeowners to make the switch to long-term, more affordable and sustainable sources of energy.  We can do that by incentivising people financially.<\/p> <p> I recently got a query from a constituent who was looking to install a new solar panel system.  Altogether, with fitting and parts, the cost came to &euro;9,000 in total.  They researched all the necessary materials and components, all high-quality and all sourced in Ireland with long warranties, and found the cost came to about &euro;3,000 for materials alone.  They will receive a grant of &euro;3,000 towards the cost, but it will still leave a shortfall of &euro;6,000 for installation and labour, which I am told takes about two days.  What is causing such overhead costs?  Do we need to consider increasing the retrofit grant?  What can we do to support people who want to make that sustainable switch?  Not many people can afford &euro;9,000 to install solar panels.<\/p> <p> I welcome the interim relief that this payment will give to families who are struggling to pay their electricity bills.  I welcome all further long-term actions to alleviate the cost of living for the many people who are struggling with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300050#AAA00200","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643907300,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I welcome the news that both the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste finally acknowledged last night that this &euro;100 credit does not go far enough to help people who are trapped in the cost-of-living crisis.  When this proposal first came up, we in Sinn F&eacute;in explained that it would not be enough.  It has taken too long for the Government to realise this.  It goes to show how out of touch the Government is with ordinary people and the cost-of-living crisis that ordinary families must live through every week.  The crisis affects everyone.  At one time, this would just affect those in poverty, in social housing and on low incomes.  However, we are now hearing that this is affecting people with good jobs, including families with both parents working.  The cost increases in electricity, gas, oil and rent are now crippling families and other people who are trying to work and get by.<\/p>  <p>  I will give one example.  Home heating oil has increased by 53%.  In May of this year, the Government will introduce the carbon tax which will drive these prices up even more.  What the Government is doing is a scandal and shame.  During the Covid-19 crisis we all stood together, but that seems to be the only time the Government will stand with people.  We have a crisis in the cost of energy for ordinary people who are trying to live.  Where is the Government's &euro;100?  People need it now.  Many people are in trouble today.  Why is it not being delivered?  Why was this kicked down the road?<\/p>  <p>  This is no longer just affecting certain people; everyone is feeling it.  For the first time in over two decades, the cost of living is going through the roof.  However, what is really worrying is that the penny is only dropping now and the Government is still not taking the action needed.  People have been feeling this for months.  The Government ignores our calls, ignores people and ignores the bills that are going through the roof.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to bring forward credible solutions.  We want to help people through this crisis.  The first thing that should happen is a rent freeze.<\/p>  <p>  This week, I was contacted by a lady who is worried about her electricity being cut off.  Will the Government allow people's electricity to be cut off at this time of year?  It is wrong.

People are facing additional costs to heat their homes.  The estimates vary but &euro;800 over the year is a reasonable estimate by <i>bonkers.ie<\/i>.  Against that background, &euro;100 is pathetic and insulting.  It is a drop in the ocean and will not cut it.  It is good the Government seems to be acknowledging that more needs to be done, as others have said.  We made the point during the debate on the budget that a &euro;5 increase and failure to expand eligibility for the fuel allowance were just not good enough.<\/p><p>When the scheme was first announced towards the end of the year, we were very clear in saying it was pathetic and was not enough.  The Government did not understand that people were literally choosing between food and heating their homes, or between paying the rent and heating their homes.  People are being hammered in every direction.  A payment of &euro;100 against that background is utterly pathetic and insulting.  The Government will need to do much more now.<\/p><p>The one piece of advice I strongly urge the Government not to take is the shocking suggestion that came from Deputy Cowen a few moments ago.  How wrong can somebody be?  Deputy Cowen must be out of his mind to suggest the answer to the current spiral in energy costs is to privatise the ESB.  That is the last thing we need to do.  In fact, the decision to move the ESB away from being a not-for-profit entity to being essentially a commercial entity, even though it is publicly owned, was the beginning of the onward and relentless drive upwards in the cost of electricity and energy.  Privatisation is the problem.  The commodification of energy supply and distribution has been a total disaster.<\/p><p>This is the key point we need to make.  Some people present inflation or a rising cost of living as if it is like the weather and it is just that the weather has changed.  We need to take measures, maybe short-term measures or maybe slightly longer-term measures, to deal with change in the weather.  Inflation is not a change in the weather.  Inflation is one group of people robbing another group of people.  We really need to get that into our heads.  The ESB last year made &euro;363 million in operating profit and that was low compared with the previous year when it made &euro;616 million in operating profits and paid out &euro;81 million in dividends.  When the pockets of working people are looted with shocking increases in the price of electricity or gas or heating oil, somebody else is making money.<\/p><p>That is true on a global scale and it is true domestically in this country.  Shell is crowing about its quarterly profits.  Shell's quarterly global sales, mostly of gas, were &euro;6.4 billion, a dramatic increase.  It pointed out that 2020 was a bit of a tough year for it, but it is all over now and it is enjoying a bonanza.  In just three months it has made &euro;6.4 billion.  Those who buy shares in Shell, as I am sure plenty of rich people in this country do, or those who have shares in any of these privatised energy companies, including some of the ones that will or are producing wind energy, are doing fine.<\/p> <p> People who are private or public tenants have absolutely no control whatsoever over the level of insulation in their homes and, as a result, the amount of energy they need to heat them.  Many social housing or private tenants are screwed and crucified.  A disproportionate number of the hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers or people in receipt of disability or other social welfare benefits are being absolutely crucified just to keep themselves warm.  On top of that, they have to pay rent.  All of that is going into somebody else's pocket.<\/p> <p> The decision to cut back supplies globally during Covid was done to keep up profits.  It is as simple as that.  It was not done based on people's energy needs, but rather to maintain profits and so that companies could keep paying dividends to people who can afford to put their extra wealth into buying shares in large corporations.  That is the reality of the situation.  Inflation is not caused by weather or a natural phenomenon; rather, it is one group of people using a crisis to loot the pockets of the people who can least afford it.<\/p> <p> Our starting point has to be that recognition, and that then dictates what sort of short- and long-term measures the Government takes.  In the short term, we need to control the price of energy, electricity and heating.  We need to introduce price caps, just as in order to control the spiralling cost of rent we need to introduce rent controls.  Anything less will not cut it.  If we leave it to the market, these people will continue to ensure their profits are high, whether from energy and electricity or the rents and wealth they generate.  We need controls so that the basic things that people need to survive are affordable for ordinary people.  Anything less is not good enough.<\/p> <p> Nobody else in the House seems to want to talk about this stuff.  We have pointed out that under the Consumer Protection Act, the Government has the power to declare an emergency regarding the cost of energy and impose maximum unit price costs.  Why will the Government not do that?  My God, the Government was pouring billions into large corporations to keep them propped up during Covid, but it seems we cannot introduce the same kind of emergency measures to control the price of energy and electricity in companies that, I repeat, are making lots of profit and could well absorb that.  That is what should happen, in particular when those companies are publicly owned.<\/p> <p> My God, the Government should not make a bad situation worse and pour fuel on the fire &ndash; sorry for the pun &ndash; by privatising these entities and drive them further in the direction of profit rather than ensuring that we provide for the energy needs of people in this country.  God Almighty, it is absolutely shameful.

Apologies.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il - it does not make much difference in truth.  It is the same to us.  The idea was to have a State company, rather than leaving it to the private market to produce energy.  A publicly owned company was created which operated on a not-for-profit basis.  That is what needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to extend eligibility for the fuel allowance to the many pensioners and low-paid workers who are being absolutely crucified by energy costs.  We need to dramatically reduce, or withdraw, carbon taxes.  Why are tenants or low-paid workers who cannot afford, through their own resources, to retrofit their homes being punished for what other people are doing?  Why are they being punished more than people who have the money to retrofit their homes?  Those who have the money, as wealthy people do, can mitigate the cost of energy price hikes.  It is the working people, the poor, the less well-off and public and private tenants who are being absolutely crucified by this and do not have the resources to do anything about it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should reduce the level of VAT, as the Spanish have done, and the PSO levies.  Plenty of measures could be taken to deal with this.  We also need to address the income inequalities which are being exacerbated by the inflation crisis, not just the 5.7% or 4.4% projected for next year because they are averages.  Inflation is disproportionately higher for people who have to spend a larger proportion of their income on rent or keeping a roof over their head.<\/p>  <p>  We need to provide wage increases to working people.  I met a group of private security workers, a group we have not talked about much in the past while.  They provide security in hospitals and on public transport.  They work in all sorts of public and private buildings.  They are earning &euro;11.65 per hour.  How is somebody supposed to live on that?  They cannot get a miserable pay increase to bring them up to &euro;12.05 per hour because of some ERO thing.  Wages should be increased to a decent living wage like &euro;15 per hour.  Everybody should be given increases that at least match the rate of inflation so that they can cope with the increased cost of living being imposed on them.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as the energy side of things, we have to deal with the biggest cost for most people, which is putting a roof over their heads.  That means introducing rent controls and not relying on the market to deliver housing supply, something it is proving to be completely incapable of doing.  We need to deliver the scale of public affordable housing we need, which profit hungry private property investors are not willing or able to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300052#CCC00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1643907900,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I cannot think of the last time that, by the time the Government came forward on Second Stage with a proposal, it had basically publicly acknowledged it was not good enough and would not do anything.  That is the state we are in now, given the comments that have been reported from yesterday's parliamentary party meetings.<\/p>  <p>  On the one hand, it speaks to the scale of the crisis facing ordinary people, in terms of the rising cost of living, of which energy prices are a key driving component, and the pressure that the Government feels.  On the other hand, it speaks to the inadequacy of the proposals it has to deal with that.  <\/p>  <p>  We can go back to the motion we put forward on the energy crisis four or five months ago, where the response of the Government was an amendment where the punchline said the market will solve all the problems and that we should rely on the free market.  The free market means energy prices continue to go through the roof.  The big energy companies are taking advantage of the situation to increase prices again and again and continue to make massive profits.  All the Government has to offer people on the receiving end of this price gauging is &euro;113.  It is a drop on a hot stove, will be wiped out by the price increases immediately and made to appear minuscule.<\/p>  <p>  The over-reliance of this Government and previous Governments on fossil fuels to power the economy has left Ireland at the mercy of global supply chain bottlenecks, as industries and countries try to boom back after the Covid pandemic lockdown and shifting global weather pattern lead to greater energy use.  Price increases are compounded by the Government's strategy of making ordinary householders foot the bill for gas and electricity infrastructure instead of ensuring its paid for in a fairer and more equitable way.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth comparing the price households in this country pay for gas to elsewhere in the EU.  In the second half of 2019, they paid 12% above the EU average.  Electricity prices were 11% above the EU average in 2019.  In 2021 they were 18% above the EU average.  What is the consequence of high energy prices?<\/p> <p>It hits those who are already struggling to pay the rent and buy groceries and who must make the choice between heating and eating.<\/p> <p> Looking at the figures for deaths from cold-related diseases or excess winter deaths as a consequence of the cold and people not being able to heat themselves properly, they are astounding.  There are 2,800 people who die this way per year, and we can put that in the context of Covid-19.  We were in favour of taking the best possible approach to minimise the impact of Covid-19 and deaths arising from it.  Approximately 2,300 excess deaths were recorded during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic between March 2020 and February 2021, so the number of excess winter deaths is more than the number of excess deaths from Covid-19.<\/p> <p> Contrary to what Deputy Cowen suggested earlier, the roots of the Irish aspects of this problem lie precisely in the direction of the privatisation and deregulation that has been going on.  The answer is to move in the opposite direction, as opposed to what Deputy Cowen suggests.  From the 1990s onwards, the EU sought to break up state-run energy companies across Europe, such as the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  In 1996 and 1998, the EU introduced the first electricity and gas directives, which forced states to open their energy systems and sell power plants and infrastructure to private capitalists.  The Irish Government did not then seek derogations from these directives, despite the fact the small size of the Irish market would exacerbate the worst effects of privatisation.  In 1999, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, opening the market to competition, and two years later it removed the not-for-profit mandate of the ESB.  Formerly public companies that were run on a not-for-profit basis were forced into a market, requiring them to behave instead like private capitalists seeking higher rates of profits.<\/p> <p> The consequence of this has been predictably disastrous.  Prices, rates of energy poverty, disconnections and the number of cold-related deaths all rose dramatically.  Privatisation or \"unbundling\" also brought inordinate costs.  Each private company involved expects a rate of profit of approximately 8% on its investment so when the price of inputs increase, it passes on those increases to maintain its rate of profit.  Energy supplier companies are charged for moving energy throughout the system and such charges are passed to ordinary energy users, making up a third of the household Bill.  These are special transmission use of system charges paid by suppliers to EirGrid and Gas Networks Ireland for using their transmission network and distribution use of system of tariffs paid to ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland to distribute energy.  These charges are the third highest in the EU and, as I said, are a third of a user's bill.<\/p> <p> Each company seeks to maximise its profit in a specific field and does not adopt an holistic approach to energy consumption.  A reduction in energy usage runs counter to these companies' economic interest, and this means those interests are the opposite of the interests of society at large.  The first renewable energy, in a sense, is energy efficiency or reducing the amount of energy we are using.  This would get us off the track of a huge expansion in the use of data centres, although unfortunately the Government still seems to be committed to this.  We should encourage users to reduce energy usage but such measures are not being adopted.  Instead, the focus is on forcing households to remain locked into high energy use and prices.<\/p> <p> Irish homes are consuming 7% more energy than the EU average due to years of hands-off housing policy, low quality standards and a painfully slow retrofitting programme.  The alternative, as outlined by Deputy Boyd Barrett, is immediate price control.  The Government has the power to do this but refuses to do it.  Price controls could be imposed tomorrow at the stroke of two ministerial pens; they would indicate the maximum unit price for gas, electricity or oil.  A second element of this is renationalisation of the energy sector, using it as a lever for a rapid transition to renewable energy.  A third element is massive State investment in retrofitting.  The State should borrow the required money at low cost and do this retrofitting for households at zero cost.  Over time, the benefit would accrue back to the State and household.  It would be an absolute win for everybody in society and our environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300052#CCC00500","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643908500,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to the energy question for a few minutes in this Second Stage debate.  I support the Bill and acknowledge, as others on both sides of the House have mentioned, that energy prices and fuel costs in general comprise one of the biggest issues facing citizens of the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future.  Many previous speakers have outlined the increases that have taken place in the past few months but it is quite clear that the outlook and projections for the next six months are similarly on an upward trajectory.<\/p>  <p>  I support the measure in the Bill to reduce the cost of electricity for individuals and families right across the country, I hope it or a similar measure can be used in future to ensure something like the particular spike we are experiencing now is not all transferred on to the backs of families and citizens right across the country.

I do not necessarily or particularly agree with Deputy Cowen that privatisation of the ESB is the right option to consider at this point but at least he put forward his position.  Everything in the current climate must be discussed.  The Opposition failed in any of its criticism of Deputy Cowen to outline options.  Those Members attacked the ESB and other energy providers about the cost at which they provide energy but they do not really provide any alternatives.  Too often in this House and other chambers across the country, politicians of all stripes but particularly of the left and far left have portrayed an idea that there are easy options for energy.<\/p>  <p>  What do I mean by that?  Currently in Ireland the Corrib gas field, for example, provides 40% of our gas needs but there was a considerable amount of opposition to its development within this Chamber, with no ready alternative being proposed.  I question and criticise the decision of the Government to close the peat generation plants, not because peat generation should be sustained indefinitely but because that closure was effected in advance of securing an alternative.  I am not trying to portray an image that microgeneration will solve all our energy needs but there were commitments given both in the programme for Government and when the Government was formed on targets for connections and people seeing rebates when supplying into the grid rather than taking energy out of it.  I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is talking about reaching those now but it is about a year after the original projection.  If we are to bring the public with us on what needs to be done in terms of energy projection, small wins like those for microgeneration and other alternatives must be secured.  I welcome the fact it is happening now but it should have happened much sooner.<\/p>  <p>  All of this matter flows into the area of planning policy.  Virtually every roof in the country should have a solar panel, if at all possible.  My part of the country in the south east has a nickname for having more sunshine than most other parts of the country.  If a business or private dwelling is installing a flush solar panel on a roof, it should not have to go through the full rigorous planning process.  I welcome the initiatives of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and his colleagues on the review of planning legislation.  Again, it is another method of ensuring we can bring the public with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020300053#DDD00200","speaker":"1510"}]
