We have received apologies from Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Verona Murphy.  If attending in the committee room, members are asked to exercise personal responsibility and protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied this morning by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  <\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to examine both the 2021 Appropriation Account for Vote 29 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2021 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services, Chapter 9: Implementation of the National Broadband Plan.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General and Accounting Officer; Mr. Philip Nugent, assistant secretary of environment protection, circular economy and governance; Mr. Fergal Mulligan, assistant secretary of communications; and principal officers, Mr. Robert Deegan and Ms Louise Carrigan.  We are also joined in the committee room by Mr. Ken Cleary, principal officer in the relevant Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  You are all very welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure that your mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665649800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 29, Environment, Climate and Communications, records total expenditure of &euro;664 million in 2021.  This was 55% more than the &euro;428 million spent in 2020, but fell almost &euro;105 million short of the total expenditure provided for in the Vote for 2021.  Receipts into the Vote during the year amounted to &euro;12.3 million, slightly ahead of what was budgeted for and the result was a net surplus at the year end of just over &euro;106 million.<\/p> <p>  The standard requirement is for any voted funds remaining unspent at the year end to be surrendered to the Exchequer.  However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may allow up to 10% of unspent capital funding in a Vote to be carried over for use in the following year.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was allowed to carry over the maximum amount from 2021, around &euro;58 million, and the balance of &euro;48 million was duly surrendered. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure in 2021 on the communications programme amounted to &euro;164 million.  This was &euro;85 million less than budgeted for, mainly because of lower-than-expected spending on implementation of the National Broadband Plan, NBP.  Anticipating the spending shortfall, &euro;52.5 million was moved from this programme to two others, using the Supplementary Estimate process.  The largest block of spending under the Vote was on the energy programme, with &euro;327 million charged for 2021.  The bulk of this, &euro;291 million, was charged to the B.4 sustainable energy programme subhead.  However, the charges included the transfer of &euro;160 million to the Department&rsquo;s energy efficiency national fund in December 2021.  As note 7.2 to the account explains, this transfer remained unspent at the year end.  The result was that actual expenditure under the sustainable energy programme in 2021 was, in fact, only around 3% up on the 2020 level. <\/p> <p>  The Department spent just under &euro;128 million on the environment and waste management programme in 2021.  Of this, &euro;49 million went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The continuing costs associated with landfill remediation are also funded under this programme and amounted to &euro;21 million in the year.<\/p><p>Members may wish to note that the Department is responsible for oversight of a broad range of public sector bodies, including the communications and utilities regulators and major commercial State bodies such as the ESB, EirGrid and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA.  The bodies are listed in an appendix to the appropriation account.<\/p><p> Turning to the report, the objective of the national broadband plan, NBP, as members will be aware, is to ensure that access to a high-speed broadband service is available to all residences and businesses in the State.  Roll-out of the service is focused on those parts of the territory of the State where commercial providers of broadband do not provide a service or do not have plans to invest, collectively referred to as the intervention area.  National Broadband Ireland, often referred to as NBI, was contracted by the Department in late 2019 to deliver on the broadband plan objectives.<\/p><p> Contractual arrangements between public and private entities to provide infrastructure and operate services typically focus on the identification of project and operating risks and on who bears responsibility for them.  The agreed risk allocation is reflected in the financial costs or rewards factored into the contract.  In the case of the broadband plan, the overall Government subsidy is capped at &euro;2.7 billion, with most of this payable over the initial infrastructure build phase.  This is currently expected to conclude by January 2028.<\/p><p> At the time the examination was being completed, the infrastructure build plan was running about 12 months behind schedule.  The target for the number of premises to be passed by end January 2022 was originally 115,000.  As permitted under the contract terms, NBI proposed in March 2021 that this target be reduced to 60,000 premises passed.  The actual number of premises passed at end January 2022 was 34,456, just 30% of the original target and 58% of the revised target.  However, it is good to note that the take-up rate for the broadband service by the occupiers of the premises passed is higher than originally projected.<\/p><p> The delays in the plan roll-out have resulted in total subsidy payments to end 2021 amounting to just over &euro;177 million.  This represented less than half of the subsidy payment originally provided for in the Vote for 2020 and 2021.  In addition, under the contract terms, certain financial sanctions apply to underachievement of the revised delivery targets.  The Department has accepted that approximately two thirds of the delay to date was due to the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions but has imposed sanctions for delays it considers relate to issues within NBI&rsquo;s control.  By end August 2022, build delay sanctions totalling almost &euro;135,000 had been imposed.  Separately, a performance sanction of &euro;22,500 has been applied based on performance reports up to end April 2021.  As the examination report was being finalised, the Department was carrying out a review of performance reports more recently received from NBI, and further financial sanctions may arise from these.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on the current status of this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665649800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and invite Mr. Griffin to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665649800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2021 amounted to &euro;664 million, 14% or &euro;105 million below the budgetary allocation of &euro;769 million, which included capital carryover.  The extensive Covid-19-related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April 2021 had a significant impact on activity on the NBP, the sustainable energy programmes and the landfill remediation programme, and this is the main driver of the underspend last year.<\/p> <p>  On the national broadband plan, I outlined to the committee when I was last before it in February, and in subsequent correspondence, the unprecedented challenges faced in delivering the plan arising primarily from the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are, however, seeing significant evidence this year that the network build has gained momentum and that this will continue into 2023 and subsequent years.  As of 1 October this year, more than 337,000 premises are design complete and 210,000 premises are under construction, with 108,000 through the make-ready programme.  A total of 94,500 premises can order or preorder a connection, while more than 85,000 premises are passed and available for immediate connection.  In excess of 20,500 premises, or 24% of the premises passed, are connected, which is exceeding expectations for this stage of the project.  Connections are running at approximately 2,000 per month.  By the end of next January, the revised target of 102,000 premises to be passed will be achieved.  In fact, we are advised this target of 102,000 premises will be achieved by end December, with a further 80,000 to 85,000 premises to be passed in 2023.  There are now more than 300 staff employed directly by NBI, along with 1,100 indirect employees working with build and design contractors.  A total of 271 public broadband connection points are live on the NBP network.  Some 470 national schools within the intervention area have been provided with a high-speed broadband connection under the plan and are either live or are ready to go live.  In 2022, roll-out to the islands commenced, with premises on four islands off County Donegal currently able to order or preorder high-speed broadband.  NBI is progressing fibre design and build actives on a further six islands off counties Galway, Mayo and Cork while progressing service and designs for additional islands off counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Cork.<\/p> <p>  In 2021, the Department provided &euro;327 million under its energy programme, up 60% on 2020.  The figure &euro;101.3 million was spent on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, retrofitting schemes, with 15,500 home upgrades completed.  This included nearly 4,100 solar photovoltaic, PV, installations, 4,600 homes upgraded to a B2 standard, 2,000 heat pump installations and almost 2,300 free upgrades to energy-poor households under the warmer homes and warmth and well-being scheme.  In addition, approval was obtained to transfer &euro;160 million from the Vote to the energy efficiency national fund to fund the establishment of a new residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme, as well as to support additional energy upgrades under the warmer homes scheme and other SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes.<\/p> <p>  Other key achievements in the energy area in 2021 include the continued roll-out of the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, with the first onshore RESS projects energised in quarter 4 of last year.  Approximately 530 MW of renewable energy is expected to have been energised by year end 2022 under the RESS, with a further 300 MW in 2023.  RESS 1 is expected to deliver an approximate 15% increase in Ireland's current renewable energy generation capacity by the end of 2023.  Auctions were completed for onshore RESS 2 in June 2022, which is expected to deliver a further 20% increase in renewable energy capacity and the design of a RESS 3 is under development, as is the design of the first offshore renewable energy scheme.<\/p> <p>  Spending under the environment and waste management programme was &euro;128 million, slightly ahead of its original allocation.  More than &euro;20 million of the &euro;128 million was spent by 21 local authorities to support landfill risk assessment and remediation work on more than 70 sites around the country, most of them old municipal landfills that operated prior to regulation and require engineering measures to ensure the protection of the environment, air and water quality for local communities.  In excess of &euro;13 million was spent on other waste management initiatives.  The majority of the spend was on enforcement-related activities.  Funding was also provided for once-off litter initiatives in 2021 to support an outdoor summer and prevent littering in public areas.  By the end of 2021, 52 just transition fund projects had entered into grant agreements and were commencing the roll-out of their projects.  The total value of projects in the delivery phase is &euro;28 million, with &euro;19 million in grant funding.  These projects will bring &euro;12 million in additional funding to the midlands and support approximately 150 direct jobs in the grantee organisations and approximately 890 indirect jobs, as self-reported by the project.<\/p> <p>  The year 2021 was significant for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC.  Following completion of a capacity review early in the year, the Government accepted the capacity review's recommendations and agreed a number of actions, including the sanction of an additional 20 staff to be appointed by the end of 2022.  In addition, in May 2021, the HSE was subjected to a serious criminal cyberattack through the infiltration of IT systems using Conti ransomware.  The NCSC provided support to the HSE in identifying the systems affected by the cyberattack and to bring all systems back online.  The Comptroller and Auditor General covered this comprehensively in the appropriation accounts this year.<\/p><p>The Department is tasked with delivering significant policy programmes to achieve a climate neutral, sustainable and digitally connected Ireland.  The Appropriation Account 2021 sets out where the Department has invested its resources in 2021 to progress the achievement of this outcome in the context of significant challenges.<\/p><p> I look forward to assisting committee members with their questions today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665649800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Griffin.

At this stage we have moved from 25 to 37.  There was quite a lot of interest, from both the public and private sectors, in the jobs that were advertised and the process is under way to recruit the additional staff.  We are satisfied that the target of 45 will be achieved by the end of the year.  We have also made provision in the Vote in 2023 that will allow us to bring forward some of the recruitment that we had intended for years four and five of the recruitment programme.  When the Government made its decision in mid-2021, it would have been mid-2026 when we expected to hit the target of 70 staff but we now expect to achieve that by the end of 2024.  It is encouraging to see the quality and calibre of people who are applying for these jobs, both from the public and private sectors.

We will have a permanent headquarters soon.  We are moving out of our building on Adelaide Road at the end of 2023 because the lease is up.  We are repurposing the Department's offices in Beggars Bush, the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, offices, as the headquarters of the Department and that is where the NCSC will ultimately reside.  That building will be fully fitted out to make sure it complies with the international standards required.  We had to make sure in the interim period that the premises that the NCSC operates from will comply with those international standards and that is why the fit-out had to be such.  It had to comply with the relevant international standards.  Those standards are set out in regulations so a significant investment had to be made in the temporary facility.  As I understand it, parts of that can be lifted and shifted to the final premises in Beggar's Bush.

So far there is a total of &euro;150,000, of which &euro;135,000 is related to the build.  Next week we will impose more sanctions, as we will in the following weeks as there are delays.  We have notified the company of a further &euro;100,000 that will be sanctioned in the coming weeks.

With regard to blackspots, we focus a lot on rural Ireland but there are obviously blackspots in urban Ireland also.  There are some glaring ones where there is fibre in the ground but houses cannot connect to it.  I know the Department is aware of certain situations.  I brought some to its attention.  It is galling for people in an estate of 700 houses where it would seem financially lucrative for them to be able to connect but service providers are not willing to take up the mantle.  This is a real problem for us.  It goes beyond the national broadband plan because the fibre is there.  How do we get around this problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#D00500","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665649800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>This issue is being brought to our attention regularly.  Part of it is because people are aware that, under the national broadband plan, the level of connectivity is well in excess of what was flagged in the plan.  The plan was based on a 30 Mb download target.  This was the bar in the mapping exercise to determine what areas were covered by commercial operators.  The minimum service now is 500 Mb.  People sitting in the middle of Dublin city wondering whether they are 30 Mb are quite envious of this.  There are two answers to this.  The first is a difficult answer that takes quite a lot of time.  We have spent a lot of time working with operators flagging issues and working through them.  It may be down to their own network and work they have to do.  Sometimes it is down to a piece of infrastructure that is needed and the operators might need to engage with local authorities on it.<\/p> <p>  I will give an overview of the broader picture of the three big providers of fixed networks outside the national broadband plan.  Eir has said it will build its full fibre network to 1.9 million premises.  Virgin Media has said it will reach 1 million premises.  SIRO has said it will reach 750,000 premises.  Obviously, there is overlap in these but they will deal with many of the problems.  The problem is that fibre brings broadband to a cabinet from which people may be a long distance on a copper line.  The build out will bring the fibre the whole way to the premises and it will resolve the vast majority of these issues.<\/p> <p>  Last week when the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, spoke on Second Stage of the Communications Regulation Bill, he made a very strong statement on the build of such infrastructure.  There is an expectation that, as commercial operators roll out and design the deployments, they do not leave small pockets of premises behind and they do not leave households and businesses stranded.  The critical point is users can connect.  This is the core point we have seen in some of the instances mentioned by Deputy Devlin.  The network is there but users cannot connect.  The commercial operators really need to look at the deployments.  It is the case in the national broadband plan that people will always be able to connect.  This is the messaging we are getting back on the connections to date.  The message the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, conveyed to the commercial operators is that they need to design their networks so they do not leave pockets behind and people are able to connect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1665649800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in.

If they do not comply with that by the delivery of the works, a compensatory financial amount can be paid and allocated to the fund.

In the context of the NBP, there is still an openness to taking an action if it can ensure a community can access high-speed broadband sooner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1665649800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I ask that this aspect be reviewed.

I refer to the frustration in those areas which are borderline amber and blue.  The blue areas are those where commercial entities are doing the connections.  I have been told about several such situations in the last week alone.  There is one area where the box that Eir has put in place is at the end of an avenue leading to a farm.  That farmer is milking more than 350 cows.  It is a major commercial operation.  This farmer will not get connected because he is in the amber area.  The likely connection date is the end of 2025.  Likewise, a great many people have said similar things to me.  One was a case where the pole where the box is based is halfway up an avenue to a farmyard, but because the farmyard itself is in the amber area it will not be connected, despite the pole sitting in the blue area.  It does not make sense that there has not been engagement with the commercial companies in these instances where places are borderline.   Can we do something to fast-track connections in those areas on the borderline between the amber and blue areas and where a premises might not be connected because it is on the wrong side of the road?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#K00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665649800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>In some instances, the Deputy is talking about a situation where a network simply ends.

The other instance, then, is one where a home is trapped within an area where there is a network.  NBI has gone to and engaged with the market, and it is running a process that is due to conclude before the end of this year.

It missed its original targets, reaching half, at best, by the end of this year.  It has negotiated remedial targets, which it has also missed.  Mr. Mulligan says it will meet its negotiated remedial targets, but there is a question about that.  It got the Department to review 39 performance indicators that were signed in 2019.  We are less than three years into this, which is a short time.  All the Department has done is impose a sanction of &euro;134,000, which NBI might get back, in the context of a contract where the taxpayer will potentially stump up &euro;2.7 billion.  I am looking at this in the round.  Mr. Mulligan confirmed that another &euro;100,000 will be levied.  I understand he cannot look into the future.

It is addressed to the competent authority for gas networks.  The Department was notified about this programme on 8 March.  The email was sent on 1 April, with a notification that a reply would be required by 5 April.  It asked if there was a national plan to boost the deployment and connection to gas networks of biomethane.  It goes on to specify that the extra volumes can be delivered by October 2022 or March 2023.  This was to get a quick turnaround to replace gas that is no longer available from Russia because of the war.  The email I am looking at dealt with that specifically.  Mr. Cleary said in response that it would require legislation.

What we have to ensure in that regard, however, is that nobody in the intervention area is left without a high-speed broadband service.  A critical point is that where other operators build and encroach on the area, they have given no commitment in that regard, whereas in the case of the 300,000 premises that were taken off the map, the operators had to commit to passing and connecting all of those addresses.<\/p><p>One could find infrastructure in an area where the majority of people - 100 out of 130 - in a hinterland could get access to it.

Where will it come from?  Is there potential to use more gas?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Griffin knows my line with regard to biogas.  We have an agricultural waste problem.  We are playing catch-up with this.  We should have been doing it ten years ago.  I was told up to a few years ago that it was too expensive.  Now, it can be produced more cheaply.  Obviously, because electricity has gone up in price, it can be produced cost-effectively, which would solve our agricultural waste problem and also generate money for farmers.  In short, can Mr. Griffin tell me where this extra demand will come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#T00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665649800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>The gas generation capacity will be procured through capacity auctions that are run by the regulator.

The key part from our perspective is that the gas generation that will be brought onto the system over the next number of years should, ideally, be methane and hydrogen-ready so that when we get the biomethane on the system, it will be more economic.  The Chairman is right about the costs of this.  When we look at biomethane in terms of the climate action plan, and when we consider the way the price of natural gas, which is very expensive, has gone over the last year or two and what the expectations are for the future, we see that it has become far more economic.  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy raised anaerobic digestion as potentially a big-income generator for the farming community.

The first category is correspondence from Accounting Officers and  Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.<\/p> <p>  No. 1487B is correspondence from Mr. Maurice Buckley, the cathaoirleach of the Office of Public Works, OPW, dated 30 September 2022.  It is a quarterly update requested by the committee regarding Miesian Plaza, Baggot Street, Dublin 2.  In 2017, the OPW entered into a 25-year lease at Miesian Plaza, which houses the Department of Health and staff of some other Departments.  The OPW&rsquo;s mismeasurement of the floor space for the building gave rise to a forecasted overpayment of about &euro;10 million during the lifetime of the lease.  In October 2018, the OPW stated that it was negotiating with the owner of the premises in an attempt to have the floor space measurements upon which the lease is based recalibrated.  The issue was highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the 2017 report on the accounts of the public services and examined by the previous Committee of Public Accounts in October 2018.  This committee also reported on the matter in May 2021.<\/p> <p>  This correspondence details an agreement in principle between the landlord and the OPW that will go some way towards limiting taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to the loss of about &euro;10 million.  The chairman states, \"it has been agreed between the parties to extend the lease on Miesian Plaza by a period of 9 months at a nominal rent of &euro;10 per annum\".  The lease was entered into at a contracted rate of &euro;10 million per annum, subject to review every five years.  The agreement would potentially claw back about &euro;7.5 million of the expected overpayment.  While that is welcome, it appears that the taxpayer will still be out of pocket by &euro;2 million or thereabouts.  It would be interesting to know if the rent review took place before the agreement and, if so, what the current rate is.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  As agreed last week, we intend to schedule a meeting with the OPW before the end of the year.

However, the Accounting Officer of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth took the view that, while they were competitive, they did &ldquo;not comply with national and EU procurement directives and guidelines, irrespective of whether the procurement was &lsquo;competitive&rsquo; in the everyday understanding of the term\".  The contracts, with a combined value of over &euro;91 million, were therefore included in the Department&rsquo;s Circular 40 of 2002 return, which details procurement that, for exceptional reasons, did not to involve a competitive tender.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will come before us in two weeks' time, on 27 October.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has flagged this for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#EE00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1665649800,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I particularly picked out a specific area.

To add to the Deputy's points, there are a lot of outstanding questions in this area but, with regard to the analysis of the approximately 1,300 additional beds, I would like to get a better sense from the Department of how the contracts were awarded to different operators.  We have seen substantial growth in the acquisition of hotels that have now been turned into de facto direct provision accommodation.  The lack of information on the awarding of those contracts is quite worrying.  There has not really been any proper in-depth analysis of this within the Oireachtas.  There is a very significant amount of public money involved and it is important that we delve into this.  It is so lucrative that hotels and former nursing homes are being purchased by private operators that are making exceptionally high profits.<\/p> <p>  The Committee of Public Accounts needs to have a look at this and some analysis from the Department is needed to get further information.  The demand is increasing as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and changes to the rules for obtaining refugee status in the United Kingdom and the additional investment and budget for the acquisition of properties under State-funded contracts for emergency accommodation to provide for people coming into the country under the existing mechanism is going unchecked.  There is an urgent need for the Committee of Public Accounts to look at this issue.

For larger section 38s and section 39s, one would expect them, as a matter of good governance, to have their own internal audit systems to examine any issues where there were concerns or, on a cyclical basis, to look at the controls that are in operation in the organisation and report to the relevant board in that case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022101300002#FF03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1665649800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>There are two things to be done.

It is a process and a means by which a local authority takes in charge all of the infrastructure of an estate that has been constructed by a private individual or company.<\/p><p>This is done after all the roads, footpaths, open spaces, foul and surface water sewers, water mains and public lighting are completed by the individual in accordance with the approved plans.  It is a big undertaking as one is taking a greenfield site and handing back to the local authority a completed housing estate at no cost to the council.  This is done in addition to paying the development fees.  The council sends out an application form on request and a list of the criteria that must be complied with.  Most of this work has to be done by a professional engineer, who has to sign off on it.<\/p><p> My story begins well, with the council making a request, sending me correspondence and, indeed, threatening enforcement letters for it to take Rocksprings in charge.  I was not at that stage in a position to fully comply with its order due to the economic downturn as some items were unfinished in the estate.  However, this was navigated successfully and all the houses and other works were finished.  I set about complying with the council's request for taking in charge.  With the works completed, I was in contact with Tipperary County Council.   The council sent me the form and a document about the taking in charge process, and what they needed in that regard.  After reading the document, I was left in no doubt that this was possible and would be completed forthwith following my lodgement of the necessary documentation to the council.  How wrong I was.  I was entering a nightmare scenario with the offices of the State through no fault of my own.<\/p><p> Who is Terence Coskeran?  I am Terence Coskeran.  I went to London in 1962, aged eight, and returned to Ireland permanently in 1985.  The reason I returned home was primarily because I wanted to give my two children the opportunity to experience growing up in a rural environment.  This was an opportunity I felt I was deprived of myself due to the economic situation in Ireland in 1962.  We have enjoyed a good and fulfilling life since returning, working and experiencing all that is good about life in Ireland.  I have no regrets.<\/p><p> Rocksprings is a five-house development in the rural village of Kilross, west of Tipperary town.  When I received the planning permission for five houses in Rocksprings, Kilross, one of the planning conditions was that the council would take in charge the estate following a written request to do so, with reference to planning condition No. 36.  I entered the agreement in good faith and agreed to abide by the conditions as per planning.  When all of the works were completed, I applied to the local authority for an application form for the taking in charge process.  I duly filled it out and submitted it to the council.  I received back a letter from the council saying that my application was received in the office on 11 July 2016 and that it would be processed in due course.<\/p><p> After some time had elapsed, I received a letter on 15 March 2017 from the council confirming that my application had been submitted and that it was currently processing same.  I received a further letter from the council on 3 August 2017 regarding the taking in charge process with the same message.  On 22 August 2018, I received a letter from the council stating that it was unable to progress the taking in charge of Rocksprings due to the presence of a wastewater treatment plant on the site.  The reason given was a memorandum of understanding agreed on 8 December 2015 between Irish Water and Tipperary County Council, which excluded taking in charge residential developments served by stand-alone infrastructure.  The only agreement I have is with Tipperary County Council, which, as part of planning condition No. 21, requested that a wastewater treatment plant be installed on site.  My engineer&rsquo;s original plan, suggested to the council, was for the five houses in Rocksprings to connect to the Hillview public wastewater treatment plant in the village, rather than have two wastewater treatment plants side by side.  Furthermore, planning condition No. 36 states that when all works are completed and subject to inspection, the council would take in charge the estate.<\/p><p> I dispute the validity of the council&rsquo;s argument on the memorandum of understanding agreement.  I had never received any correspondence from Irish Water whatsoever and had never engaged with the company on any matter at this stage.  I endeavoured to explore the new situation in which I found myself. I contacted the council and was constantly informed that I was ultimately responsible for all services until matters in respect of the wastewater treatment plant had been finalised by Irish Water and local government.  I dispute this, and cannot see its validity.  A letter of 25\/1\/22 from D&aacute;ire McGrath of Tipperary County Council to Deputy Mattie McGrath, an email to me from Evelyn Harty, Tipperary County Council, dated 30\/4\/2020, and a further email to me from Claire Hennessy of Irish Water, dated 11\/3\/2021, clearly show the issue to be a matter between local government and Irish Water, an agency of the State created in 2014, subsequent to the arrangements in place at the time I commenced the development.  I met all of the obligations required of me in that agreement. I feel I have been a pawn in this while two arms of the State battle it out over who has responsibility.  Tipperary County Council should honour its part in solving the issue and take in charge Rocksprings estate.<\/p><p> I continued to try and find a way to resolve this impasse.  I contacted public representatives about the problem up to and including the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The council informed me that the solution lay with the Government.  The Minister's office informed me that the decision as to whether any particular estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the local authority.  At that stage, I felt confused and dismayed at the contradictory nature of the responses.  I then wrote to Irish Water.  Its correspondence, dated 11 March 2021, confirms that the taking in charge is currently the responsibility of the local authority and that Irish Water is only involved with local authorities in accessing the taking in charge of certain types of residential estates and the transfer of water services assets to Irish Water for ongoing operation and maintenance.  It further points out that Rocksprings estate is not included in the terms of reference of the memorandum of understanding for these discussions, thereby confirming the taking in charge of Rocksprings is solely a matter for Tipperary County Council and is not part of the discussion on the memorandum of understanding agreement.  I was surprised, however, that when water charges were going to be implemented, Irish Water installed meters in our estate and removed the ones I had put in.  This was done without any notification to me that it was going to happen or that they were being installed.  Who authorised this work to be carried out in Rocksprings?  If not me, I assume in all probability that it must have been Tipperary County Council.<\/p><p> The other four residents and I have to pay for the upkeep of the estate.  This is done through a management company for which I am responsible.  I have had to meet the inevitable shortfall in funding as a result of the expenses incurred by the company.  The estate has been maintained to a high standard at all times over the past 18 years.  We all have to pay our property tax as well.  I also must maintain and pay for a bond with the council at a cost of &euro;525 per year.  This I have been paying for the past 18 years with no end in sight.  I have asked the council to release this bond on several occasions but have always received a negative response.  I have requested help with the upgrading of the public lighting to LED fittings but also received a negative reply.   Any assistance I have asked for has been refused.  No help whatsoever has been received from the local authority regarding Rocksprings estate, which came as a surprise to me.  When the local authority was widening the main road, I was asked for a portion of my land at the front of the estate to accommodate it.  I gave willingly without hesitation and did not seek a monetary reward.<\/p><p> There is one other very important issue at stake here for me to worry about and which causes endless sleepless nights.  When all the infrastructure was completed, I paid for the cost of this as per planning.  What is to happen in the future when upgrades or repairs are required?  Who will bear the cost?  Surely not me.  I have already fulfilled my obligation in that regard.<\/p><p> I continue to explore all avenues. This matter is having an adverse effect on me.  I commenced this project when I was 50 years of age.  This issue arose when I was 62.  I am now in my 69th year.  It has consumed a considerable amount of my energy and time in my retirement years.  I am disturbed that the agreement into which I entered in good faith has not been honoured and I greatly fear it will not be honoured in the near future.  I would like the estate to be taken in charge forthwith.  I am now a senior citizen of the State and do not want this legacy to impact the lives of those I leave behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022101300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence Coskeran","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1665615600,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.

Local authority CEOs should meet people like Mr. Coskeran.  We, as public representatives, regularly deal with estates where developers have walked away and left things up in a heap - ghost estates, call them what you like.  Here is a development that has been finished to a high standard.  I know the estate and I know Hillview beside it.  To my mind there is a very simple solution.  The engineer at the time said the best way to go about dealing with the wastewater was to connect the water treatment plant to Hillview just beside Mr. Coskeran's estate.  The council turned that down at the time because it claimed the system was not capable of taking the other five houses.  Subsequently, it agreed that it is.

The Minister's office has stated the decision to take any particular estate into charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the local authority.  Local authorities in Tipperary and around the country need to take this on board.  This is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage stating it has responsibility.

I can hear a number of mixed emotions in his statement.  My background before politics was in construction and I was involved in roads, sewerage, the whole lot.  I know exactly where he is coming from.  I cannot understand that he has struggled for so many years.  It is not that it is a 200-house estate; it is five homes.  Mr. Coskeran has done as he said in the memorandum of understanding and has ticked all his boxes.  Is the treatment plant submersible pumps or does it need to be pumped out at a cost?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Coskeran ticked all his boxes and brought his estate up to where it should be.  I cannot understand why the council is using Irish Water as an excuse because basically Irish Water and the council are the one entity anyway, but probably with too many people in top management.  Mr. Coskeran mentioned water meters.  Is the estate private still because it is not taken in charge or have they just accepted willy-nilly that they can do what they want?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Coskeran is right.  This committee is probably one of the last committees in this House that shows that there should be and there is a proper democracy here that helps its citizens.  I could hear from his tone that he is saying he has done his part of the bargain and he wants the local authority to do its part and take the estate in charge.  Why is it so difficult for the local authority to give a straightforward answer?  As he said, even if it was capacity issues, capacity issues change over years.  I accept that.  However, the capacity issues in Mr. Coskeran's five houses should not be their stumbling block for the estate to be connected either to the additional sewer, a new line or wherever it is going.<\/p> <p>  I hear his frustration.  I hope that by his coming here today to the committee it can be resolved.  I have no questions to ask Mr. Coskeran.  I wish I could tell him that everything will be fine after today.  If we need to ask someone from Tipperary County Council to come in and explain why it has not been taken in charge and try to get answers, we will do it.  I thank Mr. Coskeran for his honesty and patience.  I can hear considerable anger and bitterness from him.

It needs to be pumped out every year.  It also needs to be serviced every year at a cost to the residents.  When the other four residents bought their houses, they did so on the understanding that when all works were done, the management fees would go and they could live their lives.  When the property tax was introduced, that was an additional cost for those people.  It is so frustrating that we never get anywhere.<\/p> <p> To my way of thinking, right is always right and wrong is always wrong.  However, in this case right for me is right but wrong for the other side does not appear to be wrong.  If I have an agreement with anyone, I will abide by it.  How can the council just shuffle it around and send me from pillar to post and then when I get to it again, send me around on another trip?  It is so frustrating.  I am now in my 69th year.

It is fine for council officials to go home and they will leave their office on Friday night.  I am there on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  Council officials will leave their roles in the council and they will go some place else.  They will go off and retire but I do not have that luxury.  This is with me.  This is like a noose around my neck that will not go away.  Why is this the case?  It is because somebody who has an agreement will not honour it and they keep using other excuses.  <\/p><p> Like I said, Irish Water came in ten years after I had the agreement.  How can they do this to a normal person, to an ordinary Joe Soap who has gone around and done his best for his life on this earth, of which there is not much left?

I do not want anybody to go jail or to be hanged or anything like that over this.  All I want is fair play and for somebody else to take charge of their responsibilities and not to keep telling me about mine.  I have done mine.  Why do they keep telling me about my responsibilities?  I have a stack of letters here that I could show to members that are telling me about my responsibility.

The big problem here is that in this common-sense approach, those two words, &ldquo;common&rdquo; and &ldquo;sense&rdquo;, do not seem to be anywhere in it.  Mr. Coskeran speaks with his heart and soul because he put everything into it and he still seems to be very badly treated on this issue.

I would go further and would look for the Department and the Minister himself to come before the committee, as well as the county council.  I know it is easy for us to say but Mr. Coskeran has done everything he can.  It is a damning indictment of the council, the Department and Irish Water that they have an individual getting so upset about something that should be easily fixed.  It is a problem of their making, not of Mr. Coskeran&rsquo;s.  I hope the media picks up on this and tries to ask questions of the Department, the Minister, the county council and Irish Water.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions as well and I am looking at the council&rsquo;s submission to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  In September 2019, the council made a submission to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, under the multi-annual developer-provided water services infrastructure resolution programme.  Rocksprings was ranked fourth priority of 11.  The council went on to state that the resolution of this impasse is not within the control of Tipperary County Council but is a national issue of legacy matters to be resolved and it will continue to follow that up with Irish Water and the Department.  That goes back to what I was saying earlier.  It seems to be going around in circles.  The council is saying it is the Department but the Department is saying it is the elected members of Tipperary County Council who should make the decision.<\/p> <p>  If nothing else comes from today&rsquo;s committee meeting, as Deputy Buckley said, we will ask the county council and the Minister to come before the committee because I am also looking at the letter from Claire Hennessy, which was an email from Irish Water on 2 November 2021.  Irish Water informed Mr. Coskeran that the memorandum of understanding between Irish Water and the local authorities specifically excludes estates with their own wastewater treatment plants provided by the developer.  They go on to note that Irish Water does not have the existing network and wastewater treatment plants which could cover Rocksprings.  It also notes that the neighbouring Hillview estate had not at the time transferred from the local authority to Irish Water and therefore it was not an Irish Water asset.  As such, Irish Water could not advise on connecting Rocksprings to Hillview.  That seems to confirm that Irish Water itself is saying it had no responsibility.  Why then is it even in the picture if it is saying that it has no responsibility for it?  It should be the Department and the county council. <\/p> <p>  It comes back then to the fact that councillors have always looked for lights to be fixed in estates such as Mr. Coskeran&rsquo;s.  He would have heard that the council cannot go in and fix a light because if they fix one light, it is then deemed to have taken charge of that estate and the developer can walk away.  It has refused Mr. Coskeran lights there.  However, someone has made a decision to allow Irish Water, which says it has no responsibility for that estate, to go in and change meters.  Who gave Irish Water the go-ahead to enter a private, unfinished estate, as the council has said, to change water meters?  Did anybody ever explain to Mr. Coskeran who gave them permission to go in and change the water meters?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022101300002#D00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":623,"content":"<p>No.  As I said in my submission, the water meters were changed but I had put in water meters initially.  The next thing is that when water charges were about to be introduced, all the water meters were changed.  It astounds me.  I did not give permission, so obviously somebody must have given it.  I assume in all probability that it was the council.  What amazes me about this is that they have no problem with taking responsibility for the water that is coming in but there is an awful problem with the water that is going out.  I had a pub for years and this reminds of how if somebody came in and paid for their drink, we would tell them that they could drink away.  If they asked where the toilet was, we would not say, &ldquo;We do not have one, you will have to take that with you&rdquo;.  That is the way I felt when the water meters were put in.  Surely, as they allowed people to come in and put in water meters, was that not assuming responsibility for the estate?  Is it private only when they deem it to be private?  Is it public then when something like this, like when the water charges were about to be implemented, comes into force?  Again, my sole intention in coming here today, as it has been for the last 2,285 days, is to get this resolved and for the council to do what it is right in taking charge of Rocksprings.  That is all I want.  I want nothing else.

He stuck to the terms of that contract but somewhere along the way, something changed.  Irish Water got involved in 2018.  I cannot understand why an engineer was not sent out.  Why was an engineer from Irish Water not sent out?  Mr. Coskeran still has to pay for the maintenance because technically, it has not been taken in charge.<\/p> <p>  There is also another issue.  Mr. Coskeran should have been exempt from property tax because the site was not finished.  There was a pardon granted but I cannot remember the exact year.  I lived in the back of an estate that was unfinished and there was one year when we did not have to pay property tax.  I cannot believe that Mr. Coskeran has had to come in here to this committee.  It is an indictment of our local authorities that they cannot work with local people to resolve simple issues.  I cannot understand it.  This has gone on for 2,285 days.  That is absolute torture.

They will be brought in here and asked to explain why this has gone on for so long.  Mr. Coskeran, his family and other families have been mistreated.  There is no evidence of a commonsense approach here.  There is nothing but red tape.  Mr. Coskeran writes to the them, they write back to him but surely someone in a council van, an engineer, can visit the site.  I am not an engineer but if I go into an estate, I know if the sewerage lines are done.  Cameras can be used to check.  The council can check footpaths, lighting and everything else.  Irish Water is responsible for the water going in and out.  The council is responsible for footpaths, electricity and so on.  That is it and yet Mr. Coskeran has been fighting with the council for years and years.  Now he is in here and we are listening to his account.  I am as frustrated as he is now.  Hopefully, the press will pick up on this but, unfortunately, Mr. Coskeran's battle is not finished yet.  We will get representatives of the council and others who are responsible in here to provide answers.  This has been going on for so long that an apology should also be on the way to Mr. Coskeran.  This is an awful way to treat any person, regardless of the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Having listened to Mr. Coskeran, it is clear that somebody somewhere along the line within the ranks of the council has made a mistake and it was buried.

I wish I could say to Mr. Coskeran that this will be sorted within a week but I cannot.  What I will say is that we have to get answers on this.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of identifiable persons or entities, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.

I am the national manager of the National Advocacy Service, NAS, for people with disabilities.  We provide independent, professional and free advocacy services to adults with disabilities.  We ensure their will and preferences are heard in decisions that affect their lives.  Last year, we provided more than 3,800 advocacy interventions.  Demand for our services has grown dramatically in the past year.  Our waiting list figures have increased from 161 people in January to 251 people currently.  This increase can be attributed to being under-resourced to manage the increased demand brought onto our service due to Covid-19 related issues and, in more recent times, the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on the people we support.  In particular, almost 40% of cases this year have been related to housing issues.  We also host the patient advocacy service, which was commissioned by the Department of Health.  It provides free, independent and confidential advocacy for people who wish to make complaints about patient safety incidents in HSE-funded public acute hospitals or nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  Advocacy is vital to disability service provision.  Advocacy ensures a person&rsquo;s will and preferences are heard.  It acknowledges the lived experiences of people with disabilities and upholds people&rsquo;s rights.  Mental health is a constant factor in our work.  A total of 25% of our cases involved some form of mental health issue in 2021.  We project that this will be sustained in 2022.  We welcome the reforms to the Mental Health Act , but we would like to underline the importance of completing and implementing those reforms as soon as possible to ensure it fully protects people with mental health issues.  We work with many people who have both intellectual disabilities and-or autism, who are inappropriately placed in acute mental health facilities and have no agreed arrangement for support in the community.  In these cases, there is often disagreement between HSE mental health services and HSE disability services about whose responsibility it is to provide these supports.  We also meet people living in acute units despite being medically fit for discharge because they have nowhere to go.  I will give the committee some examples.<\/p> <p>  Anne - not her real name - was involuntarily detained in an acute mental health unit.  She had received treatment and was assessed by her psychiatrist as being able to leave the unit, but she had nowhere to go.  She presented at her local authority as homeless.  The local authority had no available hostel accommodation or social housing available, so it could only offer vouchers for Anne to access bed and breakfast accommodation.  The voucher value was &euro;65 per night but the cheapest accommodation was &euro;85 per night, so therefore, in those circumstances, Anne remained in the acute unit.  This is not an unusual example from our casework.  We also regularly experience cases where the interaction between community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and mental health services can impact the quality of life and increase rights restrictions placed on people in the community.<\/p> <p>  Another is example is Bill - again, not his real name.  Bill was living at home with his family while waiting for a funded residential placement.  Bill has a moderate intellectual disability and mental health issues.  He was previously discharged from an acute mental health hospital and was supported by a community mental health team pending other arrangements, including his own residential placement.  There was a long history of discussions for residential support but no agreement had been reached between the CHO and mental health community services for funding.  The CHO disability side argued he was not disabled enough for its criteria, but the mental health team reassessed him as having a moderate intellectual disability.  Bill was unable to cope living at home and his family eventually had to obtain a safety order due to difficulties in supporting him.  Unfortunately, Bill breached the order and was arrested and spent time in prison as a result.  If Bill had had appropriate support, this situation may not have occurred.<\/p> <p>  We also work with many people with dual diagnoses who face other issues like addiction or homelessness.  Many of these people require additional support to move on from emergency accommodation, yet there is no specific agreement to fund these supports.  Many disability service providers state that people in these situations are outside their remit.  The criteria for accessing disability services should be expanded, as currently they are frequently cited as a reason not to provide support.  We welcomed this committee&rsquo;s 2023 pre-budget submission on aligning disability funding with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, budget.<\/p><p>We were empowered by the call for adequate funding for our service so we can fulfil our role under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 when it comes into force.  We welcome the Government's recent amendments to the Act but we believe it can still be strengthened further.<\/p><p> The Act is part of Ireland&rsquo;s response to meet its obligations on legal capacity within the UNCRPD.  Article 12 of the convention states that some people will need support to fully avail of their right to legal capacity.  One such support is advocacy.  The Decision Support Service, DSS, demand forecast predicts 22,000 people will require some level of decisionmaking support.  Some of these people will require independent advocacy.  As the Act has not yet commenced, we still do not know what the impact on our service will be, but we know there will be a further increase in demand.<\/p><p> Despite the clear role of advocates in the implementation of this Act, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act lacks any reference to the role of independent advocacy.  We believe the Act should place the provision of advocacy on a statutory footing.  The Act should contain a definition of an independent advocate.  Without this, other stakeholders who might have a conflict of interest may take on the role of advocate.  The definition should focus on the advocate being independent, professional and attached to an organisation.  The DSS draft code of conduct for advocates contains a strong definition that could be replicated in the Act.  &ldquo;Independent advocate&rdquo; should be inserted into the list of recognised interveners under the Act and &ldquo;independent advocate attached to an organisation&rdquo; should be included as a person in the list of persons whose views are to be considered by interveners when they are intervening.  These additions to the Act should ensure advocates are protected in situations where a decisionmaking representative objects to the involvement of advocacy as no avenue for the advocate to pursue this currently exists other than a complaint to the DSS.  Advocates should be given the right to attend court and to access documents, data and other information regarding people they support.  This would ensure the voice of the person is central to the process, especially the voice of people with nobody to speak up for them and those with psychosocial and dual diagnoses.  These issues are all hugely important to our work and to the people we work with.  I thank the members of the committee for their continued commitment to support the work of the committee on psychosocial disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I am a committee member of the National Platform of Self Advocates, NPSA.  The platform is an organisation for people with intellectual disabilities run by people with intellectual disabilities.  We work to make sure the rights of people with intellectual disabilities are respected.  I thank the committee for inviting me to speak about a rights-based approach to disability in mental health.<\/p> <p>  People with intellectual disabilities are more likely to experience difficulties with our mental health because of the discrimination we face so this issue is very important to us.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, sets out how to take a rights-based approach to mental health.  I will give a few examples of how the Government can do this for people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p> <p>  We should have the same choice as everyone else about where and with whom we live.  The UNCRPD states that we have the right to live independently and be included in our community.  The State should support us to do this.  Even though the Government promised over ten years ago that it would make this happen, people with intellectual disabilities are still living in group homes where their choices are limited.  People might think these smaller homes do not impact on our mental health because they seem a bit better than the big institutions we had before, but simply using a different name for an institution does not change how it feels to live there.<\/p> <p>  People with intellectual disabilities should have the same access to jobs and training as everyone else.  My job helped me with my mental health during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is developing mental health and intellectual disability teams and it is important these teams be based and offer care in the community.  Information about the mental healthcare these teams offer should be available in accessible formats like \"easy to read\" so people with intellectual disabilities can make choices about what treatment they want and do not want.  Teams should talk to people with intellectual disabilities so they can tell them what services they want and need for their mental health.<\/p> <p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 states that a \"mental disorder\" includes a \"significant intellectual disability\".  I feel strongly that having an intellectual disability should never be a reason for me or anyone else to be detained and treated against our will.  The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has said the same thing.<\/p> <p>  I ask the members of the committee who are working on changing the Mental Health Act to ensure it does not treat people with intellectual disabilities unequally.  It also should not allow anyone with a disability to be treated differently for their mental health than they would be for their physical health.  If the Government keeps the promises it made when it signed up to the UNCRPD, many issues which impact on the mental health of people with intellectual disabilities will be improved.  It will also mean mental health services will be accessible to us.  The Government needs to talk to us and take on board what we tell them.  A rights-based approach to disability in mental health means respecting and listening to what people with intellectual disabilities have to say and what we need to support and improve our mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe McGrath"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I would like to say good morning to Mr. McGrath.

I will highlight three key issues in my opening statement.  <\/p><p> I will discuss the rights of people with mental health difficulties first.  People who have long-term mental health difficulties have rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  The term used by the UN to describe people living with enduring mental health difficulties is &ldquo;psychosocial disabilities&rdquo;.  This is not a medical diagnosis.  It is about the interaction between people with mental health difficulties and their social environment.  Psychosocial disability refers to the functional impact or barriers that those living with enduring mental health difficulties experience every day.  For example, under the convention people living with psychosocial disabilities should not be discriminated against based on their mental health experiences.  This is true also of Ireland&rsquo;s equality legislation.  People may choose not to identify as disabled or with a diagnosis but the fact remains that they have rights.<\/p><p> People with psychosocial disabilities face high levels of stigma and discrimination, have higher costs of living and are at risk of living in consistent poverty.  In fact, the Cost of Disability in Ireland report shows that the average cost of having a mental health difficulty amounts to &euro;13,251 per year, which is a significant financial burden to bear.<\/p><p> People with psychosocial disabilities are not a homogenous group and we must always keep individuality and intersectionality in mind.  It is important to note that a person with psychosocial disabilities may also be a Traveller, a person with intellectual disability or an LGBTQI+ person.  These groups of people already experience marginalisation and stigma and, therefore, the stigma of having a mental health difficulty can be compounded in these instances.  That is the reason these groups are listed as priority groups in Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.  Priority groups also include people experiencing homelessness, people in prison, ethnic minorities and others.  This priority focus must extend beyond policy into tangible action.<\/p><p> As the committee will be well aware, the UNCRPD sets out a series of obligations on states to ensure that persons with psychosocial disabilities have full protection of human rights.  Article 4.3 states that disabled people and disabled persons' organisations, DPOs, should be consulted in legal and policy developments relating to their rights.  Psychosocial disabilities can be invisible disabilities and, therefore, it is important to inform people they have rights under the UNCRPD, equality legislation and other human rights instruments.  It is very welcome that the committee is examining this matter today and raising awareness of this.  All of the articles of the UNCRPD extend rights to people with enduring mental health difficulties.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, Ireland is one of only three EU member states that has not ratified the optional protocol to the UNCRPD.  This is the mechanism that allows disabled people to take complaints to the UN.  We respectfully request the committee urgently progress this matter.  The State must ratify the optional protocol without delay.  The State must also remove its reservations on Articles 12 and 14.  This leads me to my final point, the relevant legislative changes in mental health.<\/p><p> The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is finally set to be commenced and implemented from 21 November 2022.  This historic and long-awaited legislation is interlinked with the reform of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Article 12 of the UNCRPD states that state parties shall recognise that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life.  Article 14.1(b) states that people should not be deprived of their liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily and that the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty.  Regrettably, Ireland has reservations on both of these articles which means it will not fully realise these rights for people with psychosocial disabilities.  People with psychosocial disabilities are the only group of people who are excluded from their rights in this way.  We urge the committee to address this discrimination with the Government.<\/p><p> We acknowledge the significant work done by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, their officials and others on bringing forward the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 on involuntary detention but more must be done for full equality to be enshrined in this legislation.  The Bill to reform the Mental Health Act must be brought to the Houses by January 2023 at the latest.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Ms Weedle and I look forward to discussing these matters with the committee.  The committee is in a unique position to hold the Government to account on its obligations under the UNCRPD.  We ask members to ensure that people with psychosocial disabilities are not forgotten in this important task.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Before I invite members to put their questions, I ask them when called to identify the person or persons they wish to answer your question.

I felt that this was too important to miss and because I was scheduled to speak first, I decided that I could put aside my personal matter.<\/p> <p>  My points are mainly for MHR because I want to focus on the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022, which is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  In the context of preparing for Committee Stage, I have had numerous conversations with people with psychosocial disabilities, whether or not they accept that, and I am disturbed by their life experiences.  Consequently, I am anxious about the fact that the Bill will further perpetuate the suspension of the advance healthcare directive, AHD, for people who come within that category of disability.  When queried, the Minister aligns it to a necessity for reform of the Mental Health Act with it.  While that is laudable and much-needed, MHR mentioned a deadline of 2023 and that is the first I have heard of a date being given.  Can I clarify in the first instance whether that is the date that MHR is proposing or has it some reason to believe that otherwise?  I have not been given any sort of a deadline when I have inquired about it.  That is an important feature.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the experiences of people with psychosocial disabilities finding themselves in a situation of either voluntary or involuntary detention and suggestions are made to them that in any other context I would consider coercive control where women are reminded of their duties to their children and the potential for a medical practitioner to contact Tusla and raise child protection issues.  No matter how harmlessly that is being said, there is no way to experience that other than as a dangerous threat. Such issues are within this sphere and do not get enough attention.  I am mindful of the audience listening to this and feel a huge responsibility to be as careful as I can in my choice of words, but we need to expose what is potentially happening.<\/p> <p>  A number of weeks ago a \"Panorama\" programme was aired that featured secret filming in the UK.  Coincidentally, in the same week the Mental Health Commission issued a statement about restrictive practices that included disturbing figures for the time people spent in isolation with one instance of more than a year.  We are not exploring or exposing issues like that.   We are not speaking enough about the fact that a psychosocial disability does not remove a person's human rights.<\/p><p>When the Act is commencement, it would be a real risk we have.  As it is not stitched in and not embriodered fully into the Act, that could happen.  We have been looking for that legislative amendment but unfortunately it has not yet been incorporated.  psychosocial disability does not remove one's human rights so I applaud the work, especially by Mental Health Reform, in speaking up.  What more can politicians do?  I am aware of the time so I will stop speaking there, apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#C00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":679,"content":"<p>We watched Senator Seery Kearney debating with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on Committee Stage amendments and I sent an email afterwards to thank her for how strongly she spoke on human rights and about people with psychosocial disabilities.  It was very welcome and people with lived experience who we link in with watch these debates and listen in and pay attention to legislation that makes a difference to their lives.  It is really appreciated to hear the Senator make those arguments on the floor of the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  First, regarding January 2023 - that is me throwing out my wishful thinking - we have been waiting for a long time for reform of the Mental Health Act, 2001.  The expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 reported back in 2016 but yesterday the Sub-committee on Mental Health published the pre-legislative scrutiny report into the heads of Bill with 19 recommendations.   One of those recommendations is on the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the alignment and linkages between the two.  That is really welcome and is something we know the Attorney General is working on at the moment; we also know it is a priority piece for the Minister of State in the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Butler.  We are asking really nicely that while this side of Christmas is probably not realistic, the final Bill would be drafted by the Attorney General by January.  We could all put that date out there for when priority legislation would be decided on next year.<\/p> <p>   On the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, the Senator is absolutely right.  For years since the 2015 Act was enacted Mental Health Reform has been highlighting the discriminatory exclusion of people involuntarily detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act and under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2010.  We did a human rights analysis on the heads of Bill to reform the Mental Health Act last year.  That highlighted again the need for the linkages between the two so that is when we started to write to all of the relevant Ministers.  The advanced health care directive is an amendment that relates to health, the assisted decision-making relates to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Mental Health Act was being looked at by the Sub-committee on Mental Health.  This is something that we have been asking about and bringing up in different committees; there are a lot of moving parts and we want you guys to talk to each other as we have been asking for the same things from everyone. <\/p> <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, were mentioned in the Senator's speech and it agrees that the exclusion is discriminatory, as do the Mental Health Commission and the decision support service.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and everyone we have spoken to about it this year agrees the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 is discriminatory.  If the only solution is that we have to wait for reform of the Mental Health Act, that is why that needs to happen right now.  The longer the delay, the longer the omission so anything that we can do to support your calls we will absolutely do.<\/p> <p>  On coercive practices, the Mental Health Commission publishes an annual report on the number of restrictive practices.  In Sharing the Vision, our national mental health policy, we have an aim to work towards a zero-seclusion, zero-restraint method of practice.   It is something that is being looked at more internationally around coercive control and restrictive practices.  The exclusion and prohibition of certain practices, particularly for under-18s, is something we would advocate for.  Again that is linked to what is happening with the reform of the Mental Health Act so it is really about fitting the jigsaw pieces together and we are really glad the Senator has mentioned them here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":680,"content":"<p>In summary, I support the point that reform of the Mental Health Act is beyond urgent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#D00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>As a committee and as individual Members of the Oireachtas we need to keep raising this and pressing the point home.

My next questions are for the National Advocacy Service.  It discussed how the interaction between community health organisations, CHOs, and mental health services increases rights restrictions placed on disabled people in the community and cited the case of 'Bill'.  Could they elaborate on that point?  We often encounter this issue whereby poor communication and engagements between State services, in this case with the HSE itself, have really negative impacts on individuals and families.<\/p> <p>  The National Advocacy Service also articulated the importance of giving statutory recognition to the role of independent advocacy in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, to enable such advocates to participate in decision-making and to have the right to access information and ensure the voice of the person affected is protected.  To my reading of their statement there is a very real danger that the service it provides could easily be disregarded under the Act.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#D00900","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Cairns's second question first.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, even with the amending legislation, still does not make any specific legislative provision for advocacy.  There is no definition of advocacy in the Act.  As I mentioned in my opening statement there is one in the draft code of practice.  In effect all the other players involved, individuals themselves as relevant persons, the different tiers of decision-making supporters, as well as recognition of other State players, are all defined and all have clear functions and responsibilities under the Act.  There is no reference to advocacy.  However when one reads the code of practice and looks at the at the decision support service's, DSS's, own prediction in terms of demand it is quite clear there will be a substantial increase in demand for advocacy services.  The specific point we made was that because the only recourse we would then have, should there be an issue about access to advocacy, would be to make a complaint to the DSS, say about the activities of a decision-making representative.  They could disregard advocacy services.  We have had the experience over a long number of years that many actors who have statutory or regulatory functions can disregard what an advocate is saying because of our non-statutory basis.  The importance of that is not about the advocacy service <i>per se<\/i>.  It is important because the advocate is the only independent person providing that support to the individual.  The individual may have very strong family support but that does not mean family members are not without their own interests.  They may have strong informal advocacy from their service provider, such as the HSE, but there can be a perception of, or a real conflict of interest there.  The advocate is the only one, by the nature of how the organisation is established, funded and how the service is provided, that is a truly independent service.<\/p><p>It is a real risk we would have when the Act is commenced.  As it is not stitched in and embroidered fully into the Act, that could happen.  We have been looking for that legislative amendment but unfortunately it has not yet been incorporated.<\/p><p> On Deputy Cairn's first question about the interaction between State services, it is absolutely true and it has long been our experience of people who have both mental health issues or psychosocial disabilities and another disability type falling between the stools and not being able to access appropriate supports.  It is particularly the case for people with intellectual disabilities and mental health issues that there is often a disinterest by the HSE to provide those services.  It often comes down to how the HSE's funding is structured.  It will have a mental health budget and a disability budget.  It is trying to contain that budget and if it sees that another side of the HSE, another division, could provide that funding, that will be the position it would take.  It is part of the bigger picture discussed by Ms Grogan in the earlier questions and in her responses to Senator Seery Kearney's questions about the overarching structure and how it is all integrated but also in a very practical way in how services are delivered and how they are operated.  It is really critical that we try to get out of those silos and say that one has to look at individuals and packaging for them as opposed to packages out of budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Could I ask one quick question to Mental Health Reform, Chair?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#E00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#E00300","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

One of the things the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will do is make advanced healthcare directives legally binding for everyone whether in terms of physical health or if one is receiving voluntary mental healthcare treatment.  People will have sat down with their supports or advocates and made a plan for the type of treatment they want or do not want.  For example, people might say electroconvulsive therapy is not something they want or that certain medications do not work for them.  Everybody will have their rights and their will and preferences respected unless they are detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act or the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2010.  Every other person will have the right to have their advanced healthcare directives followed in healthcare settings, except people who are involuntarily detained.  In the work we have done around it, people are more likely to make advanced planning for their care if they have been through a mental health crisis before.  People do not necessarily sit around on a Saturday night thinking what they will do in case something happens next year.  People are making informed choices about their treatment and body when they are well.  A lot of mental health admissions are readmissions.  If we are to be trauma-informed and recovery-oriented in our approach to mental healthcare and to people with intellectual disabilities and psychosocial disabilities, then, as Ms Loughlin said, it is about listening to them and to their voices.  At the moment, there is going to be a cohort of people excluded from that right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I have a final comment.  When we were going through the process of the assisted decision-making stuff, it was unacceptable in many ways and it was very rushed.  It is very complex legislation that I found difficult to get my head around in such a short period of time.  There was no plain English version of the legislation which people could understand more easily.  It turned out that all of that rush was for nothing, so it is good to have a further discussion about it.  Ms Grogan explained things like the advanced healthcare directive really well.  People often make them during times where they might have early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease or dementia and their decisions are respected.  In considering that somebody's decisions would not be respected, that example made it easier for me to understand, not to mention the issues around the codes of practice and absence of engagement with disabled persons organisations, DPOs.

My first question is for the National Advocacy Service.  It mentioned housing and that something like 40% of the cases it deals with are to do with housing.  People living with intellectual disabilities are still living in group homes and so on.  They do not have many choices.  How does the National Advocacy Service see that rolling out over the next number of years to try to change that, so that people are able to live independently and are included in the community?  Article 19 of the UNCRPD outlines that.<\/p> <p>  In some cases people with intellectual disabilities get jobs but they are not greatly paid, so we need to address that.  The committee issued a report, Enhancing Participation of People with Disabilities, recently and a lot of this was included in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#E00700","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Deputy Ellis is correct on housing.  Some 40% of our casework involves housing in some shape or fashion.  When we talk about housing, we include people living community group homes or who are quite often stuck in group settings, whether mental health settings or a more general hospital ward; people living with family members, even though they want to live independently; and people who are waiting allocation of housing because they may have acquired a disability, so it might be very difficult for them to find appropriate housing, and that can extend to younger people under 65 living in nursing homes, of whom we have a large cohort in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  An issue that come up for us is that people may be offered social housing but it often does not meet their needs in terms of accessibility in that it has not actually been designed properly.  It might be standard local authority-type housing.  The cost and the necessity of making it fit for their needs is not always met.  With the huge pressure on housing at the moment, that is exacerbated further.<\/p> <p>  The other piece Deputy Ellis mentioned was the number of people still living in group homes and that is absolutely true.  We have a very good Government policy, Transforming Lives, which I think must be ten years old and yet the delivery of that is still very slow.  There are still several thousand people living in community group homes and, as the Deputy said, they were not given an option or were not involved in the decision-making as to how they ended up living there in the first instance or whether or not they wish to continue living there.  There are huge issues around Ireland's compliance with the UNCRPD around autonomy and decision-making.  Even when we have the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and when we have the reform of the Mental Health Act, it is unlikely that will be addressed because it is about the delivery rather than the legislation itself.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ellis also mentioned employment.  To secure a job and feel good about getting up and going to work in the morning, one has to feel safe, secure and happy in one's environment.  It is very difficult to do that.  When one joins the dots between people living in the types of settings we just described or still living in homelessness, being able to secure employment is really challenging.  The other thing to note is the levels of discrimination that people still face.  A lot of surveys have been done on people's attitudes towards disability and about having someone with a mental health working alongside them.  There is still a lot of stigma associated with it.<\/p> <p>  We have more to do.  We have a lot of talk about mental health but it can be a bit fluffy at times in society at large.  We talk about mental health but when one really gets down to people with enduring psychosocial mental health conditions and the supports they need, that is where I would like to see the focus.  If we really put the structures in place both in terms of policy and legislation but also in how we design services, we would see more people able to take up employment.<\/p><p>Another point is that many people with multiple diagnoses can also end up in addiction because they are not getting the requisite supports.  They can often also fall into homelessness.  Particularly in Dublin, we know our homelessness services are not designed to support people with those additional issues.  They are just not set up for the complexity of having, for example, an intellectual disability, an enduring mental health condition and an addiction issue.  They are under too much pressure.  There is a lot of work to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. McGrath.

If everyone else in the able-bodied community can go out and get a job, there are organisations like Enable Ireland and EmployAbility Clare out there to help people; they help not just people with disabilities but people with other difficulties as well.  There are organisations out there that can help people to get jobs and get things working right for them and their mental health.  It is very important that all of the Departments involved in this legislation and the UNCRPD start talking to each other or European authorities will start fining the Government for not implementing provisions of the capacity legislation.  I have been a co-trainer on that capacity legislation for nearly four years now.  I am disappointed that very little has moved on since I did it and it is only now that it has gone through the Seanad.  We are still debating about people with disabilities.  At the end of the day, the Government needs to be more proactive.  If something needs fixing it should be fixed.

Something we are really good at in Ireland is developing a theoretical pipeline, but we are less good at following through on the plans.  Sharing the Vision as a national mental health policy is really good.  What we are doing differently this time, to give credit where credit is due, is that there is a national implementation monitoring committee.  There are action plans and deadlines.  The first implementation plan for 2022-2024 has been published with specific short-term, medium-term and long-term goals.  If you were to look at all of the plans, you would say it is absolutely brilliant and that it is going to work really well.  Specifically on Sharing the Vision, recommendation Nos. 48, 50, 51 and 57 all relate to mental health and intellectual disability, dual diagnosis and speech and language therapists.  The commitments are there, but it is the follow-up that is the issue.<\/p> <p>  Dual diagnosis is interesting.  We did a piece earlier this year around mental health and addiction, such as alcohol and substance addiction.  Dual diagnosis is also used if people have a mental health issue and an intellectual disability or a number of different disabilities or health issues affecting them.  It comes back to that piece about looking at the person and their scenario, such as whether they are in insecure housing; have grown up in poverty; have an intellectual disability; and are living in poverty.  It is similar to what was said about the funding streams - people will not fit nicely and neatly into these boxes.  If we start to look at people in terms of the whole person - I see Mr. McGrath smiling, I hope that is a good smile - and all of the social aspects that affect their lives, that will make a difference.  There is the national clinical programme around dual diagnosis as well.  Anita White in the HSE is doing great work on a model of care for dual diagnosis.  There are a lot of good national clinical programmes around early intervention in psychosis, eating disorders and ADHD.  There are lots of good things happening in different community health organisation areas and different silos.  That is one of the reasons we have been calling for the reappointment of the national lead in mental health in the HSE, so that you have someone who has strategic oversight pulling all of those pieces together.<\/p> <p>  If I may, Chair, on Article 14, to answer Deputy Ellis, when Ireland ratified the UNCRPD in 2018, we said we would do all of these things, except maybe not Articles 12 or 14 and only relating to people with mental health difficulties.  We are either ratifying and implementing the UNCRPD or we are not.  It is like Mr. McGrath's point about consulting with people with disabilities, we are either listening to disabled people and their organisations or we are not.  It also highlights the importance and need for the fully-funded independent advocacy service.  If people do not have anyone or if they are coming up against the notion that, \"You have rights, but there is a reservation on that article, so you might not have those rights\", where can they go?  As was said, people are trying to get by with housing or work and if you have a fully-funded independent advocacy service that is fully resourced, they have somewhere they can go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Canney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#F00600","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Thank you Chair.  I thank Senator McGreehan for letting me in.  I have tabled a question on the optional protocol ratification, which is due to be taken in five minutes in the D&aacute;il.  I do not need any responses back at this stage, but I thank the witnesses.<\/p><p>I have been listening to them all morning.  What keeps coming up is that it is about rights.  What has also come up is that we have a lot of rules and regulations, but the implementation or the pipeline gets clogged or someone sends it down a different avenue.  It all comes down to different sections within the Department of Health, whether mental health, disabilities or others, competing for funding.  That is why my colleague, Deputy Verona Murphy, tabled a question in the D&aacute;il.  I will be taking that question for her later today.  We are asking for a procedure for people who are not receiving services or whose rights are not being vindicated by means of which they can challenge the State to ensure that there is delivery in this regard.  I will work with the witnesses to ensure we have a system whereby people are treated equally and their rights are upheld.<\/p><p> I saw the examples Mr. McGrath or someone else gave someone being in a bed and breakfast and another person who could not live at home or whatever.  Sadly, until we get the accommodation right, we will still have people in congregated settings and long-term homes where they should not be.  At the moment ,1,300 people under 65 years of age are in homes.  A major body of work needs to be done, and money will be required to do it.  Mental health and disabilities should be removed from the Department of Health and the funding relating to them should also be removed in order that we know exactly what is being allocated.  Someone described the current situation as a percentage of the overall budget being allocated.  That is all they are, a percentage.  We do not know what is in them.  The committee has work to do to highlight that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#F00700","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for attending.  This is a important meeting.  Every week, we hold important meetings.  However, it is important to discuss this issue and learn about it.  I have been learning this morning from listening to the witnesses.  Much of this has been misunderstood or permitted to be misunderstood and ignored.  People will be prescribed too much medication, sent off in a box or told they are not fit.  It is a circle, and people do not get out of it because we are failing to understand or being allowed to pretend that we do not see what is happening.  We see constantly that people with disabilities are not given the space to be heard or, exactly as was stated a moment ago, to have what is suitable to them.  We are failing to support them across the board.  We look at healthcare, housing, education and employment, and then we go back into that circle again whereby we fail to provide support services.  People have mental health issues, and how could they not?  I am surprised that the figure is only four in ten people who have been sidelined and have mental health issues.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for MHR.  Thankfully, a lot of community and voluntary services are available to support people in the context of mental health services and moving to a social prescribing model.  I am a big advocate of social prescribing.  It is a fantastic model when it is best suited to the person involved.  We are funding many of these groups.  MHR provided massive grants last year, which was extremely important.  Where is the oversight in respect of these organisations?  They are delivering an important service to people who are either vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.  Are their results being audited?  Are they delivering mental health services?  They are calling them mental health services, but are they delivering them in a way that is suitable for the people to whom they are delivering?  We need to ensure they are able to signpost, because, as we all know, the social prescribing model is part of a package.  It might not be the entire package.  Where is the oversight and potential auditing in this regard?  The State is spending a lot of money and we need to ensure it is being used properly.  That is not to belittle any of the organisations involved.  I just want to ensure that they have the arm around their shoulders in order to bring them to where they want to be.<\/p> <p>  I also have a question for the National Advocacy Service.  Local government is a centre point for many things.  It is a major cog in the wheel of creating safe and supportive communities.  Are local government staff trained, equipped or in any way effectively supported to help individuals with disabilities who come to their offices?  Are they equipped to direct people to where they need to go?  Is a social worker who might be in a local government office able to do this?  Is the separation between the HSE and local government so big that we are losing a lot of people from the system?  The HSE delivers housing in some cases, or not as the stories we have heard quite rightly indicate.  Local government also provides housing.  There is a gap in the middle.  Are a lot of people being lost between those two stools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#G00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>On the governance piece relating to organisations providing services in the community and voluntary sector, if they in receipt of any State funding, whether from the HSE or the Pobal scheme to support national organisations, - many, though not enough, funding streams are available to the community and voluntary sector - strict reporting guidelines must be adhered to.   The Charities Act 2009 must also be adhered to.  There is a great deal of oversight and governance of any organisation in receipt of State funding.<\/p> <p>  MHR distributed the smaller grants.  We had a robust process in that regard.  Our 81 member organisations include large entities such as the Samaritans, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Barnardos and Pieta House, as well as smaller local organisations such as the Finglas Addiction Support Team.  All of these organisations have their own boards and governance structures.  That is not a concern.<\/p> <p>  The community and voluntary sector fills many of the spaces in which the State does not or cannot provide direct services.  A report was done by our innovation team called Brave New Connections, which I can send to the Senator later if she likes.  It showed how overnight, when the Covid happened, many groups like Jigsaw and My Mind had to switch to an online service delivery model and that the demand for helplines in particular increased dramatically.  Both what we have seen and what we have heard from our members is that there is demand for services.  Some of their services have had to be redirected to the crisis front-line helplines.<\/p> <p>  I understand what the Senator says about funding.  The recommended amount internationally is that approximately 10% to 12% of the overall health budget should be spent on mental health.  Even though the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Butler, managed to secure an additional &euro;72.8 million this year, which is a record amount of investment and which brought us up to an investment of more than &euro;1.2 billion in mental health, it still only equates to 5.1% of the overall health budget.  We are far behind when we look at specific mental health budgets.<\/p> <p>  On the other community supports, some of the things we mentioned that are positive are initiative such as that relating to the community caf&eacute;s.  There have also been pilots of well-being caf&eacute;s and recovery colleges.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that I have been speaking a lot.

It was a nationally representative study.  It is important to bear in mind that it only monitored 12 conditions, to use the term that was used in the study.  That is 12 particular conditions.  It is very likely that it is a much wider.  One has to bear in mind that in any study, it is about the people who cannot participate in the study.  Who is not being reached?  I refer to the digital divide and those who cannot access these kinds of things.  It is possible that the rates are much higher but that is the most recent nationally representative study that is available.<\/p> <p>  Regarding delivering the correct supports to the cohort that is appropriate, I know a lot of our members have particular thresholds for what is appropriate for their service and when they need to refer on.  For example, Jigsaw operates a referral pathway where it will support people if they need to go on to access child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  If they need to go back to their GP, they will support them in writing a referral letter.  The Jigsaw offices are much more approachable, friendly and warm environments that are far less daunting than going directly to clinical environments.  It would support them in that way.  People will not be turned away.  Even if Jigsaw cannot meet their needs, it will support them through a referral pathway.  The issue that some people face is that sometimes they are not necessarily being given that direct access to CAMHS and it is piecemeal.  That is a challenge in that area.<\/p> <p>  It is really important to recognise the lack of employment supports for mental health difficulties.  If we consider the reasonable accommodation fund, which is designed specifically to support people with disabilities in a work environment, there are zero provisions in that for mental health.  We have flagged that.  We did a submission back in May 2019, which is on our website, on the lack of supports for mental health in the workplace and what can be put in place.  Some &euro;1 million is being allocated to reasonable accommodation fund in this year's budget and we would hope that some of that is directed towards mental health supports in the workplace.<\/p> <p>  On the individual placement and support, IPS, model and service, we have 40 IPS workers who support people with psychosocial disabilities to secure and, very importantly, sustain work.  They do not simply withdraw supports once the person is in place.  They are integrated into clinical teams.  We have received fantastic feedback on how successful this programme has been.  The concern is that it is not nationally available.  It is a postcode lottery.  You might have an IPS worker on your mental health team and have that support with work but it is geographically based.  We have 40 IPS workers but nationally we have 112 general adult mental health teams, to put that into perspective.  We do not know yet whether there will be any funding allocated to that from the mental health budget but we would hope that will be progressed as well.<\/p> <p>  The term \"dual diagnosis\" can be confusing because it can be used in two ways - one with mental health and intellectual disability and one with addiction and mental health.  On the mental health and disability teams, back in 2002, the National Disability Authority flagged what Ms Loughlin talked about, that is, this difficulty of access as to whether you belong with disability services or with mental health services.  What is happening is that people are being thrown back and forward.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that is quite difficult with intellectual disability is that there is a lot of overshadowing, of attributing distress to somebody's disability when it is mental health related and they are not getting the adequate supports for that.  In order to address that, chapter 14 of A Vision for Change in 2006 referred to mental health intellectual disability teams.  What was advised and recommended was to have two teams per 300,000 of the population.  At the time, that would have equated to 29 teams.  If you look at our population now, we should have 32 teams nationally.  We have 12 partial teams.  There is a model of care for this.  The HSE released a model of care in 2020 around these teams.  We made a submission to the review of a Vision for Change, which we sent to this committee, with a specific section on intellectual disability and mental health and the needs around these teams.  Sharing the Vision carries forward the recognition of that gap and the fact this needs to be addressed.  There are 12 partial teams and what we have heard in our engagements with people who work directly with people with intellectual disability and mental health or their families and supporters is that a place could be deemed to have a team, which might be not fully staffed.  There might be one psychiatrist, which is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a multidisciplinary team or there might be a team in place but it is inaccessible.  We would like to see more clarity around the mental health and intellectual disability teams, where we are at with the staffing of them and where we are at with progressing that to become nationally available.<\/p> <p>   One other point was around the seclusion and restraint issue.  There are huge concerns in mental health services around seclusion and restraint and we are grateful to the Mental Health Commission for having such fantastic oversight of that.  However, it is important to recognise that there is no guidance on seclusion and restraint in education settings.  They are currently working on guidelines.  The process beginning in 2019.  We still do not have guidelines formalised.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to look at what is going on in Northern Ireland around this at the moment in a campaign called Harry's Law.  This is a campaign run by a mother from County Tyrone as a result of her experiences of having her son restrained in school.  What they are trying to do in Northern Ireland is to have this legislation enshrined in law.  What we are working on are guidelines, which are really important and should be progressed, but these are not enshrined in law.  There is currently no requirement to report and from what we have heard this disproportionately affects people with disabilities in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanna Weedle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>To go back to the question on local government and, in particular, whether local authority staff are equipped, trained and supported to provide the requisite services to people with disabilities, I cannot really answer that.  They would really need to be asked.  We would know of pockets of good practice but our experience would be that it depends on individuals.  That is something that local authorities themselves would need to answer.  They are under so much pressure in terms of the demand for housing at the moment and our experience would be that the issues around the accessibility of housing that is appropriate for people with disabilities is really problematic.  That is an issue of supply.  Obviously, I know the whole policy around housing is to increase supply both in the private sector and in the public and social housing sector.  I know the Minister has made a number of commitments around universal design of new homes.  This is really fantastic and should have been done a long time ago.  However, that is going to take time to come on stream.  It is this coming on stream of the housing which is the major issue.  It is exacerbated if you are living in housing where you cannot get upstairs to your bathroom.  The conditions some people are living in are absolutely appalling.  That can lead to spirals of further decline in terms of your disability and your mental health.<\/p> <p>  I cannot answer the question about whether those staff are equipped.  More could be done but I would say they are probably under huge pressure with regard to that.<\/p> <p>  On the separation between the HSE and local authorities, I know from my experience in Scotland that they have moved over to social care partnerships, between health and social care partnerships, and there is a history there of combining those services.  If you live in a local authority area, your occupational therapy and speech and language services are all delivered through the local authority.  There is probably a question mark over how successful that is in terms of stitching that in with an overall package.  It is a relatively new in that they have stitched it all together.  I am speaking from my own experience here.  There are models there that could be considered.  There are definitely issues with the complete separation of health from housing.  If you are not living in good quality accommodation, your health is going to suffer, whatever your personal circumstances are.  There is definitely something to be done there.<\/p> <p>  On that overall piece about stitching it together, there is a national housing strategy there and it includes an increased role for tenancy sustainment officers.  I am not sure about the implementation of that.  Again, that would be something that would be really welcome.  If there was a link between a tenancy sustainment officer and what was going on with someone's healthcare package or their disability support package in a proper multidisciplinary manner, which included the person at the centre of that and directing it, we probably would get a lot further, more quickly.  Sometimes these things sound a bit highfalutin or things we will never be able to do but we must remember those types of services are actually a lot cheaper to deliver than it is to have people living in campus-style or congregated settings or stuck in an acute hospital or an acute mental health facility.  Someone who is having an acute mental health crisis might really need access to that facility.<\/p><p>Someone may be well enough to go home but cannot do so because there is nothing there for them.  We have to step back and look at it more coherently and structure it in a better way.  There is a lot of good stuff there.  The policies are there.

It is about making sure people are aware of what services are available and that they are free or affordable.  That would also be important.  I know Save Our Sons &amp;amp; Daughters, SOSAD, for example, does some brilliant work in my community offering counselling services to people.  The family resource centres also offer counselling but they are inundated with people and the HSE refers people to them, which is ridiculous in this day and age.<\/p> <p>  Staying on the over-prescription model, it is something I hear a lot about.  I hear it from parents of children who are attending child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and there have been different scandals around CAMHS and what is happening in the different teams.   It is continuing into adult treatment as well.  There is also a huge issue with parents of autistic children who are with the children's disability network teams but have developed a mental health issue, often because of the lack of supports within the community.  Then CAMHS is refusing to address their issue because they are autistic.  When I say that to somebody in CAMHS, they say they are not getting support from the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, and the CDNTs say that CAMHS is refusing point blank to deal with the children.   We need a lot more collaboration between different organisations.  As was noted, many people are falling between two stools where they are supposed to be pigeon-boxed into one or the other and then they are saying that they do not fit the criteria for mental health or they do not fit the criteria for disability, where they actually have both issues.   <\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the over-reliance on prescription, both in the community and in residential settings, and about the continued use of detention orders in certain cases and even wards of court.  When we are coming up to the implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act that should not be continuing in this day and age.  Witnesses talked about how investment is needed but we also need to look at an overhaul of services and how they are delivered because over the years, we have had an over-reliance on disabled people, especially those with intellectual disabilities or those with mental health issues being institutionalised, locked away and forgotten about and in many cases mistreated.  Thankfully we are a long way from that but we still have an awfully long way to go.  Do our guests have any comments to make on medication or the over-reliance on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#J00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I would see the medication piece as part of the overarching continued unregulated detention.  That is how I think of it and those are my own words, not a recognised term.  Whether it is a younger person under 65 living in a nursing home because he or she has an acquired disability or a person with an intellectual disability who was placed by his or her family in a large campus-style setting, maybe decades ago at this point, we still have an excessive number of people living like that.  Even then, some people may have been supported to move to live more independently but that model is still not really there because it could actually just be another group home albeit in a slightly different setting.  When we talk about that, to me they are all still variations of deprivation of liberty because the person has not really meaningfully consented to living there.  I refer to someone who is under 65 and in a nursing home.  We have many cases and we made a big contribution to the Ombudsman's report, Wasted Lives:Time for a better future for younger people in Nursing Homes.  We had provided advocacy to many of the people featured in that report and we had to escalate them to the Office of the Ombudsman because we had no other avenue to support them.  You are talking about people who were literally breaking down crying out for help and still could not get out.  They are deprived of their liberty.  They were not choosing to live there.<br\/><br\/>There is still an over-reliance on medication, <i>pro re nata<\/i>, PRN prescribing in residential settings.  It still goes on and I know there has been some activity on it in recent years but it is still there and it still happens.  Until we get to a point where people are actually living lives of their own choosing, that is something that will still happen because it is done in response to what is described as challenging behaviour.  That is actually just a person in extreme distress who is not being listened to and whose rights are not being supported and they end up, like we would all do if in that situation, acting out their distress and that can be the response to that.  It is not in all cases and there is movement on it and that is great.  However it is important to call out bad practice as well.  It still exists.  We still come across those types of situations.  <br\/><br\/>We have also had situations quite recently of younger people on the autism spectrum who are out of child and adolescent services and are now in adult services but cannot get the appropriate supports.  They have ended up in an acute mental health setting and they cannot get out because they cannot access the supports.  I am talking about people at the start of their lives who are having those experiences.  There is not necessarily a mental health condition there at all but it is because they have autism and because of how it has manifested itself.  We have supported them to get out and their families have had to be really active in supporting them to access supports.  Where that often ends up is that the HSE would have an emergency placement fund at the start of the year which they have tried to cap in recent years.  I have been involved in some work with the HSE to try to move away from that model but it is really slow work to get away from a dependence on emergency placements.  When they use up those emergency placements, that money is taken away from the delivery of another service.  The reason people end up in emergency placements, and it can often be autism-related, is because they have ended up in such a situation that they have had to be placed in really dire and very expensive emergency-type placements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Loughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#J00700","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>Mr. McGrath raised a really important point on equality of access to counselling and psychotherapy and more generally, there are difficulties with funding and access to talk therapies in mental health care.  There is an organisation called Disability Psychotherapy Ireland which is a very small organisation, an interest group of psychotherapists who provide psychotherapy services to people with a disability.  For anybody listening or counsellors or people providing those free services, if they are interested in supervision in that area they do provide those supports.  That is important because as Mr. McGrath said one needs to know that a service is accessible and that they are able to provide the accommodations one might need to access therapy and that it will be a welcoming and safe environment to go into.  I wanted to say that organisation is there.  In terms of autism and CAMHS what we have heard is that because CAMHS is so under-resourced, it has massive waiting lists and that there can be, understandably, a defence of the resources it does have because it is trying to meet the need.  That comes back to the drastic underfunding of services, particularly in CAMHS.<\/p><p>There is a defence of expanding the remit when they cannot meet needs at the moment based on the resources they have been given, for the waiting lists they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanna Weedle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I want to ask the advocacy groups what their view is on supported housing.

Have we got the right approach?  There are very few housing bodies, in fact, I think HAIL is about the only one in this country doing it, and it is very limited.  What is the opinion on that?

It is not without issues but it is a far more successful model than the traditional one-size-fits-all local authority-type housing.  In Ireland we also have quite a bit of practice of disability service providers still being actively involved in the provision of housing.  There was an example in the news last week of a mother who ended up transferring the title of her house over to a disability service provider in order to secure the provision of that home for her adult son with an intellectual disability following her own passing.  They were happy that was the right solution for them as a family, which is fantastic, but it also speaks to the issues we have in that it was a family home and somehow or other it has ended up being transferred to a disability service provider.  That might be okay in a one-off situation but it probably points to a bigger issue about ensuring we have an adequate supply of housing for people with disabilities that meets their own needs.  One thing we have also come across on the housing piece is that sometimes when people are offered either housing from the local authority or when they are stepping down, to use that term, from a large institution, it can be very far away from their home place.  It could be an out-of-county placement.  That is quite acute in County Dublin and it goes out beyond there, so people who might have a work placement or a whole community or a day service they attend, but what they are being offered is housing.  It is unsustainable for them.  We would not ask anyone else to live so far away from their home supports.  That is part of the bigger picture of the housing crisis we are in.  There is more to be done under the national housing strategy in terms of enhancing the role of those approved housing bodies with those specific remits.  They can deliver more bespoke services for people with their own particular needs.<br\/><br\/>On prisons, there is no open door <i>per se<\/i>to advocacy.  Our role with regard to prisons is more when people come out.  Another perennial problem is prisoners leaving prisons and not being able to access the appropriate supports, particularly around housing.  We often see people going through the criminal justice process and support them to help them understand the advocacy process.  That can be a person appearing as a witness or an accused person, particularly in the complex situation of someone with multiple health disability-type issues as it can be really challenging for them to understand what is going on.  The legal profession and the courts are not necessarily equipped to provide those supports so that is another area we provide.<br\/><br\/>Another area of our work is with parents with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, and their interactions with the State in terms of housing.  I think Senator Seery-Kearney mentioned this morning, for example, when they are in acute mental health settings and perhaps having interactions with TUSLA.  About 15% of our work is supporting parents with disabilities who are going through childcare processes under the Child Care Act 1991.  This can often involve care orders brought by TUSLA seeking to bring a child into care.  That is a whole other session that I would urge the committee to have a look at.  It is an area of massive complexity.  These things are all interlinked.  If you do not have the right housing or supports around you, you are more likely to struggle with your parenting.  Many of the people who come into that system are people who might have gone to mainstream school or people with quite a mild intellectual disability who have been quite successful in their own terms.  They have gone to mainstream school and may have secured employment and housing but when they become parents, that is when they start to struggle with their parenting skills perhaps because they have not been adequately supported.  Everything then starts to crumble around them.  I know that is not exactly on-topic this morning, but these matters are interconnected.  There is more work to be done on prisoners and there is definitely a role for advocacy for prisoners in terms of getting ready for life outside of prison, how they are accessing supports, their interactions, maintaining family relationships and all of those things..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Loughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>HAIL housing is one of our members.  They do great work.  Before our pre-budget submission launch we had a public survey and we also went out to our member organisations to get feedback from them.  Martine Ferland, the CEO of HAIL, said to us that a challenge HAIL encounters is the ongoing under-funding of tenancy sustainment support services for people with mental health difficulties.  Government funding has not increased in over seven years for tenancy support services and the funding currently does not match the full staff and management costs.  The discussion around tenancy sustainment and approved housing bodies links in with what we are talking about.  Some people have families, supporters, carers and communities around them, but what about people who do not?  A person's network could be the tenancy sustainment officer or supported housing like in HAIL; the people who are going to link you up with other advocacy services or talk to you about the decision support service and your rights.  We always have to come back and remember the voices that are not at the table as well, who are not getting the information and do not have those wider support networks around them.<\/p> <p>  The prison piece we are working on was given ethical approval in 2019 and then this little thing called Covid-19 happened.  It put a bit of a stop to things.  It is a mapping of the mental health services in prisons across the country for which we already have the HSE funding.  Recently, we were waiting for the justice report from the high level task force, which looked at mental health and addiction in prisons.  We have restarted those conversations with the Prison Service.  Everyone agrees it is something that needs to be looked at in more detail.  If you have a quick glance at the literature, you know that people with mental health difficulties and intellectual disabilities - those marginalised groups - are overrepresented in prison populations.  It is something we are looking at and we are glad to see that there is an appetite to find out what the research is behind it and to try to get some evidence-based pieces.  That is coming down the line.  We have found with the director of the Prison Service that there is definitely an appetite for the research to take place, so I hope that goes ahead unhindered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022101300002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I think that is all of our speakers for today.

Since our foundation in 2012 as a national and non-partisan organisation, we have been providing direct supports, training and interventions to inspire, equip and support a diversity of women from communities across Ireland to enter and succeed in politics.  We strongly advocate for systemic changes to make politics more accessible, inclusive and safer for women, along with driving dynamic collaborations to help achieve our vision of full and equal representation of a diversity of women in Irish politics.  We are driven by an ambition to help Ireland realise 50:50 representation by 2030.  To this end, we want to see 1,000 women supported to run for local election in 2024 and 250 women running in the next general election.<br\/><br\/>Equality for women in Ireland is a critical driver of social and economic development.  The achievement of full and equal representation of a diversity of women in public life is key to achieving and realising gender equality in Ireland.  Not only do the continued low levels of women in public life result in a weaker democracy, but the absence of women from the centres of power and decision-making in public life can reinforce harmful norms and behaviours in wider society, which can manifest in some of the worst forms of discrimination and abuse of women.<br\/><br\/>As we will hear in more detail from Dr. Buckley shortly, the data paint a stark picture.  Ireland is ranked 100th in the world for the percentage of women in Parliament, with men occupying 77% of D&aacute;il seats and 74% of local council seats.  In 2022, only four women represent the whole province of Munster in the D&aacute;il.  There are 11 constituencies and 23 local electoral areas with no women elected to represent them.  A Traveller woman has never been elected locally or nationally.  We are still waiting for our first female Taoiseach and the first female Minister for Finance, to name a few positions.  Despite our pioneering start for gender equality in politics when Countess Markievicz was elected as Europe's first female minister, we have floundered and lagged when it comes to equal and fair representation since that first D&aacute;il.  Considering we have had 100 years of women in political life in Ireland, it is fair to say that our political institutions and systems have deliberately worked against women becoming active citizens in our own country.  The absence of a critical mass of women from the D&aacute;il and the majority of local councils hurts everyone.  The lack of diversity in decision-making is severely limiting the potential for effective governance and a healthy democracy.  This <i>status quo<\/i>is also damaging Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation as a progressive country.<br\/><br\/>If we are serious about tackling gender inequality in Ireland, we have to radically address a key driver, that is, the distribution of power in politics.  Put clearly, radical and practical solutions to accelerate to 50:50 representation are imminently needed.  A priority focus must be the extension of 40% gender quotas, with nested ethnic quotas to take effect for the 2024 local elections.  The solutions need to include non-compliance penalties and an initial package of financial incentives for political parties that meet the 40% minimum target.<\/p><p> We welcome and encourage the fully resourced implementation of proposed legislation on hate crime, online abuse and other measures aimed at increasing security and tackling the high prevalence of targeted abuse, particularly towards women in public life.  <\/p><p> Explicit maternity and paternity leave provisions in the Oireachtas and local government are already 100 years past their due date.  We welcome the recent introduction by the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, of the general scheme of a Bill to introduce maternity protection and other measures for local authority elected members.  However, we encourage a greater urgency to pass and implement this Bill as there are sitting councillors who are currently negatively impacted by the absence of maternity leave provision.<\/p><p> We understand the constitutional changes needed to allow for a modern Oireachtas.  We strongly advocate that such a referendum is packaged with other proposed referendums that this committee is considering.  We welcome in particular Deputy MacNeill's Bill on the thirty-ninth amendment of the Constitution to facilitate remote parliamentary voting.  We believe it is critical that the Oireachtas is modernised and enables modern and hybrid vote-working for Deputies and Senators, in particular to attract women from rural areas and politicians who have caring responsibilities.<\/p><p> We also welcome the Ceann Comhairle's commitment to the full implementation of the Oireachtas forum on a family-friendly and inclusive Parliament.  We recently worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland to advise the development of a family-friendly toolkit for local government and we strongly urge local councils to apply this resource and further develop a suite of measures to make local politics more inclusive and family-friendly.<\/p><p> We welcome the assembly's recognition of the positive impact of the programmes Women for Election has been delivering for the last decade.  However, to truly maximise our impact and the impact of other groups we need to see both a significant scaling up of resources and the introduction of a coherent national government strategy, with clear targets, actions and resources to ensure that Ireland rapidly accelerates to 50:50 by 2030.<\/p><p> The prevalence of last minute ticket additions or unsupported female candidates needs a more radical approach.  Fundamentally, political parties need to select and support women and men equally in the next elections.  While very necessary, quotas should be the minimum target and 50:50 should be the established standard.  This requires a radical shift.  There is no shortage of practical and systemic solutions, including those I have outlined above.  What is needed now is the political will from across the leadership of all political parties to implement them.<\/p><p> We strongly advocate for the full and imminent implementation of the assembly's recommendations Nos. 20, 23 and 24 and we commend the assembly members and this committee on the careful consideration of these solutions.  If we are serious about tackling one of the main roots of gender inequality in Ireland, the need and time for a comprehensive, radical solution towards 50:50 is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gleeson for that succinct and clear outline.

I thank the committee for allowing us to participate remotely today.  In doing so, the committee recognises that innovation is required to facilitate women in rural Ireland to contribute to politics.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 local election results made stark reading for women in rural Ireland.  Overall, 24% of county councillors elected were women.  This figure is, of course, skewed by the high number of women elected to councils in Dublin and surrounding counties where at least 30% of those elected were women.  This picture changes dramatically the further from Dublin you go.  Of the 37 county councillors in Donegal, just four are women.  In 2019, three women and 15 men were elected to each of Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon County Councils.  In Longford just one woman was elected in 2019.<\/p> <p>  For ourselves, the arrival of Covid meant moving SHE fully online, meaning women beyond our originally envisaged north-west and midlands region could participate.  We are now nationwide with women from all over Ireland joining us.  We are joined by women from Mayo, where just two of the 30 county councillors are women, from Monaghan, where there two women in a council of 18 members, and from Kerry, where four out of 33 councillors are women.<\/p> <p>  SHE supports the citizens&rsquo; assembly&rsquo;s recommendation to extend gender quotas for party candidates at general elections to local elections.  As the purpose of SHE is to support women into local politics in rural Ireland, we will limit our contribution today to our area of expertise of local elections and rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Our support for this recommendation is because it complements two areas of our work in rural Ireland, namely, SHESchool and the Women&rsquo;s Regional Caucus.  We do not support quotas only as a method of strengthening a pipeline from local to national politics, although we recognise that many national politicians start their political careers in county councils.  We believe that making the pipeline a focus depreciates the valuable work of local government.<\/p> <p>  The first of our reasons for supporting quotas comes from our free online SHESchool, providing political and election education to women.  See Her Elected has written Ireland&rsquo;s first guidebook to running in the local elections, which is available for free in English and Polish.  The guidebook is supported by free online practical workshops.  The innovative success of SHE and SHESchool has been recognised at a European level as SHE won the Democracy Innovation in Politics Awards in December 2021.  This is the first time this prestigious European award has been won by a project from Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Our SHESchool workshops are for potential candidates and the women who will support them as part of campaign teams.  In November 2021, we had 108 women register for our first foundation workshops.  Those who completed the series have now started our practical strategy workshops to put together the nuts and bolts of their campaign strategy.  Another 135 women have just commenced our second foundation workshops and are working on getting the groundwork for a local election campaign right.<\/p> <p>  The second area of the work of SHE that speaks to the citizens&rsquo; assembly recommendation is that we are joint secretariat to the Women's Regional Caucus in collaboration with the Association of Irish Local Government.  The caucus is a network of 42 women councillors from 13 neighbouring local authorities who have voted by a large majority to support the citizens&rsquo; assembly&rsquo;s recommendation for quotas at local elections.<\/p> <p>  In an ideal world, gender quotas would not be necessary but in SHE we are dealing with a reality in rural Ireland that requires a sharp acceleration.  This is an entrenched reality.  Since the formation of the State, only 11 women in total have been elected to Donegal County Council, nine to Clare County Council and six to Leitrim County Council.  These statistics are typical across rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Both the SHE programme and the Women&rsquo;s Regional Caucus are supported by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under the stewardship of the Minister of State, Deputy Burke.  From our strong vantage point at SHE we can see how a policy that supports women in rural Ireland into local politics with SHE&rsquo;s guidebook and SHESchool workshops and supports a robust network of rural women county councillors in a caucus can be solidly underpinned by the introduction of gender quotas for local elections, and hence our support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Thank you so much Ms Farrell and Dr. Maher for a very succinct and clear overview.

In my submission and comments, I focus on recommendations Nos. 20, 23 and 24 of the citizens&rsquo; assembly report as they relate to political leadership and participation.  The proposals laid out in my written submission last March, some of which are highlighted in this opening statement, are intended to generate a conversation about advancing gender equality in political life in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To begin, I wish to highlight some research on decision-making.<\/p><p>In US-based business research, led by Erik Larson in 2017, it was found that &quot;inclusive teams make better business decisions&quot;.  In that study it was found that &ldquo;all-male teams make better business decisions 58% of the time, while gender diverse teams do so 73% of the time&rdquo;.  While this research was conducted in a business setting, its findings are instructive for other decision-making fora, including politics.  <br\/><br\/>The under-representation of women&rsquo;s presence, voices, perspectives and lived experiences at decision-making tables in Ireland is well documented.  In 2009, the Women&rsquo;s Participation in Politics report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights described Ireland as an &ldquo;unfinished democracy&rdquo; due to the under-representation of women in politics.  Thirteen years on from that report, women remain under-represented in political life.  Some of the statistics have been discussed already but it is worth repeating that four of 15 cabinet Ministers are women, five of 20 Ministers of State are women, only 37 of 160 Deputies are women, and 23 of 60 Senators are women.  Women account for less than 26% of the members of local authorities and five of 13 MEPs are women.  Ireland ranks 21st among the EU 27 for women&rsquo;s political representation in the Lower House of Parliament and in an international ranking for women&rsquo;s representation in parliament, Ireland rests in the 100th position. <br\/><br\/>While the positive effect of legislative gender quotas for general elections is clear - since the law&rsquo;s adoption, women&rsquo;s representation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has increased by 48% - as Ireland was coming from such a low base prior to the implementation of gender quotas, gender parity in political representation is still some distance away.  Across all levels of political decision-making in Ireland, local, national and European, there is plenty of scope for improving gender balance, inclusion and diversity.<br\/><br\/>One of the measures which the committee may like to give consideration to is extending legislative gender quotas to all elections.  One way to operationalise this is through a financial incentive mechanism whereby supplemental funding is made available to parties that select 40% or more women to contest local, D&aacute;il, Seanad and European Parliament elections.  Another measure is improving family-friendly practices, including the provision of maternity and parental leave entitlements and supports for public representatives<i>.<\/i>The announcement in June 2022 of Government approval for a maternity leave scheme for local councillors is very welcome.  At the national level, the recommendations of the report of the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament may be useful to the committee&rsquo;s work in this regard.  This report sets out progress on legislative and constitutional fronts on matters such as maternity leave and remote meetings and voting. <br\/><br\/>The consequences of online abuse directed at those in public life is underlined in research by Professor Josefina Erikson and colleagues in their research of Swedish Members of Parliament.  They found that &quot;men exposed to high levels of online abuse seem slightly more inclined to leave politics whereas women report that they feel that their personal agency is circumscribed to a greater extent&quot;.  The National Women&rsquo;s Council&rsquo;s Toolkit on Social Media Policies for Political Parties, co-authored by Ms Claire McGing and Dr. Valesca Lima, may be useful to the committee&rsquo;s work on putting in place supports for those subjected to harassment and intimidation, including counselling supports, party codes of conduct and technical supports such as an online anonymous reporting tool.<br\/><br\/>There is also a need to enhance inclusion and diversity in political participation through diversity measures such as nested quotas, whereby targets for ethnic minority women are set within political parties&rsquo; gender quotas.  Recent research published by Dr. Pauline Cullen and Mr. Shane Gough, entitled Different Paths, Shared Experiences: Ethnic Minority Women and Local Politics in Ireland, sets out 40 recommendations for change which may be useful to the committee&rsquo;s work in this regard. <br\/><br\/>Consideration should be given to targeted funded measures such as those recommended by the Independent Living Movement Ireland in its policy document launched in March of this year<b>. <\/b>The movement called for a specific fund to level the playing field for disabled people contesting election who face &ldquo;additional costs due to impairment related barriers, that non-disabled people do not need to consider&rdquo;.  In the UK, an EnAble Fund for Elected Office was established between 2018 and 2020, with funding provided by the Government Equalities Office. <br\/><br\/>There is also room for addressing gender biases and stereotypes from an early age.  The work of Mr. Cormac Harris and Mr. Alan O&rsquo;Sullivan, winners of the 2020 BT Young Scientist of the Year, may be instructive in this regard.  They examined gender bias and stereotypes about science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects and professions among girls and boys aged 57, and have gathered resources to be used by teachers and parents that explicitly target gender bias. <br\/><br\/>Finally, there could be a role for the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, or the new Electoral Commission in publishing annual gender equality, diversity and inclusion  audits of political parties.  I am happy to discuss these and other measures in the conversation that will follow. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Thank you for being so concise and for giving us such a wide array of different measures in this and your previous submission.

I was listening remotely to the contributions and I thank everyone for them.  It can often be difficult when everyone is online but at the same time, there are lots of advantages to that as well, particularly when it comes to women in politics.  Our guests hit the nail on the head when they said that we need to have more flexible arrangements but that probably applies to an awful lot of work.  We often find ourselves in a difficult position because it sounds like we are advocating for ourselves when we are talking about politics but what we are really saying is that we need to open it up so that more women and more people from diverse backgrounds can participate.<\/p> <p>  I have said previously that this is not just about gender but also about one's family circumstances.  When I was elected to Galway City Council there had been no mothers on the previous council.  There were women on the council but there were none who had children.  We need to remember that in the conversations that we have.  What the Green Party has found is that we have lost women councillors who were elected.  The issue is not just about being elected but also about sustaining that over one's lifetime and through the changes that happen.  I would love to hear our guests' thoughts on that.  We have discussed maternity leave but I also think that having a full-time job or a part-time job while also having caring responsibilities is probably too much for anyone.  I would welcome our guests' thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Seanad in which, as a Senator, I am deeply interested, 40% of the current Seanad are women but that is because of what one could call a manipulation of the system.  It is the case that not many women were elected but the Taoiseach's nominees were predominantly women and that made up the deficit.  The Green Party only ran women in order to try to redress the imbalance in the D&aacute;il, even from our own party.  Are there creative ways to redress the imbalances within politics?  One suggestion made previously was to emulate Malta which, as I understand it, has a panel of women and if not enough women are elected, women from the panel are added in order to make sure that politics looks like normal society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#E00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Senator O'Reilly has raised a number of issues and I invite Ms Gleeson to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#E00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":743,"content":"<p>In terms of caring responsibilities, I would refer the committee to the National Women's Council toolkit.  We need a radical culture shift, particularly in local government but also within the Oireachtas.  The Ceann Comhairle has assured us that the implementation of some changes to the running of the D&aacute;il are imminent.  Sessions will be run in parallel so that working hours can be shortened.  The current situation is not helping anybody with caring responsibilities at all.  It is also not helpful in terms of quality of life and is not good for decision-making.<\/p><p>These are practical things that could happen quite quickly if there was a will to do so.  In terms of care responsibilities, which brings in the committee's other work on the Constitution, we must get at the disproportionate responsibility of care that is held predominantly by women and the attitudes within society that maintain that.  In a previous role I oversaw research that examined attitudes towards decision-making in the home, roles within the home and leadership.  Some 30% of young men and older men still believe that women should be the main carers and men should be the main managers of the finances.  It is worrying that men aged between 18 and 25 still hold these attitudes.  The wider constitutional work on valuing care and also looking at the equal distribution of care is critical.  We would support that article.<\/p><p> In terms of family-friendly locally, I worked in a partnership company in 2001 and at that point there was farm relief expenses for board members to be able to attend committees but there was no childcare relief or care relief expenses.  If we can accommodate the animals being taken care of we can accommodate children being taken cared of.  That should be built in to the expense mechanism within local government.<\/p><p> I welcome very much the proposals from the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  I am aware that the working group on the non-pay measures in the Moorhead report has put forward a number of measures.  The Moorhead report is strong but it is did not go far enough on the role of the councillor and the remuneration of councillors.  The role is not as attractive as it could be and it does not have as much support as it should have in terms of basic administrative support for councillors, akin to what Oireachtas Members have.  That would be welcome, and would make the role more attractive.  We must target women right across the spectrum, from very young, and even into schools, as we in SHE are doing to get young girls more engaged in politics.  The research shows that girls are likely to step away at the age of 12 and 13 from an ambition in politics whereas boys continue.  It is equivalent to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and to women in sport.  As we are celebrating some incredible successes this week, we must look at that in politics as well and our relationship with it.  We must make it an attractive role by focusing on the family-friendly piece and the inclusion piece.  If we think about families that are more marginalised in society, it is about making the D&aacute;il and the local chambers attractive to those families and how they are represented.<\/p><p> With regard to the Seanad, I do not have the technical solutions and, therefore, I will defer to others but we cannot rely on the will of the Taoiseach and the list system.  We welcome that in terms of the intervention because we were concerned when the numbers dropped so low following the Seanad elections.  There should be mechanisms in place to ensure there is a quota system on all of the panels.  We welcome parties being proactive in that regard, but we should not rely on the will; it should be a standard that we expect.  Ultimately, the Houses need to be reflective of society.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gleeson very much.

For example, we have been doing workshops for political parties and we believe that a lot of the work starts with them.  If we are talking about financial incentives, we must also see the results of that in the evidence of party support for candidates rather than just putting somebody on a ticket to make up a quota.  It is important that we have meaningful outcomes from those incentives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I would like to pick up on Senator O'Reilly's concern about the attrition rate among female county councillors because it is something that we share.  There is no point in us and our friends in Women for Election doing work to support women into politics if they are not then staying in politics.  That is why we extend what we are doing out into campaign teams.  We are not just trying to support women to become candidates; we also want well-equipped women to get behind them and to help them get support in rural Ireland.  It is one thing that we would like to be able to continue.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the electoral system itself, I welcome the setting up of an Electoral Commission.  The question is how political parties can be incentivised to not only reach quotas for women but also to place them into one of the seats.  It is not just a numbers game.  The women candidates need to be supported into seats where they have a chance of winning.  As part of its research budget, the Women's Regional Caucus has written to the chairperson of the Electoral Commission to look at how quotas could be introduced and how political parties could be incentivised.  Part of the programme within the Women's Regional Caucus is how to make the job more doable for themselves.  They are concerned that a lot of council meetings are beginning to slip back to being in person, and that makes it hard to balance for those who are students, and those who have caring responsibilities or another career.  Some members cite that local authorities say there are issues with equipment and facilities that must be addressed and supported centrally.  That came out strongly as well in the family friendly toolkit that the National Women's Council recently prepared.  From the perspective of an outsider looking in, it would seem that there are easy fixes to keep the hybrid method of working in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Farrell very much.

On the point about sustaining women in politics, the recent announcement on maternity leave for local councillors is a very positive step in that direction.  From the research, I see that when women do leave, often it is after a period of trying to balance the work of being a councillor, possibly full-time employment outside of that, and childcare.  A lot of that comes to a head when a councillor has a child for the first time.  The maternity leave provisions are quite positive in providing supports for women to take maternity leave.  The proposal outlined in the heads of the Bill is a facility to co-opt a substitute.  That is a positive first step in sustaining women in politics.  It goes without saying that something of that nature needs to be also extended to the national level.<\/p> <p>  In terms of encouraging greater numbers of women to come forward to the Seanad, and in the selection of women, there might need to be a body of work done on the nominating panels, both the inside and outside panels.  Perhaps as part of the process, there could be a rule or regulation on having 40% women on the list of candidates put forward by nominating bodies for election to the Seanad.  That might go some way towards addressing the under-representation of women in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to Malta, which introduced an electoral law and amended its constitution in 2021, whereby if in the course of a general election fewer than 40% women are elected there is now a capacity to add up to 12 extra seats to the parliament to bring up the proportion of women.  I looked at some of the figures yesterday.  Malta has jumped from being somewhere around 12% or 13% to 27% as a result of the mechanism introduced last year, which was rolled out for the first time in the recent election in March and April.  I do not know how that would work in an Irish context or whether it would be constitutionally possible.<\/p><p> The other issue I would keep an eye on, one which Ms Farrell and I spoke about, is the need to select women to winnable seats.  Following the recent census in April, there will obviously be a review of the constituency boundaries, and I understand there is talk of an extra 11 Teachta Dala&iacute; being added.  There have been suggestions that we might see an increase in the number of three-seat constituencies.  Again, the research shows that a higher district magnitude within a constituency is more favourable to the election of under-represented groups in society.  I would be keeping an eye on that, although I would be somewhat cautious because if we see an increase in the number of three-seat constituencies, parties will probably select one candidate at most in some of those constituencies.  This will mean they will more than likely go with the tried and tested incumbent.  As we see from the figures, just 23% of seats in the D&aacute;il are held by women and 77% of the incumbents are men.  Will that be an issue going forward for the selection of women to winnable seats?  As I said, that is something to keep an eye out for when the review of the constituency boundaries comes up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I would have liked to have seen six-seat constituencies written into the Electoral Act in order that we could examine whether we could have six-seat constituencies.

As far as I am aware, and I will point to the constitutional expert on this, while a minimum district magnitude level of three is mentioned in the Constitution, I do not think we have a higher upper limit.  Back in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, it would have been regular to have had constituency sizes of more than five, six, seven or eight seats.  It is only since the late 1940s, and certainly since the 1980s, that the commission reviewing constituencies directed a maximum of five seats.<\/p> <p>  As far as I am aware, we have the space within the Constitution to go further.  Certainly, the research on electoral systems and women's representation tells us that a proportional representation-based electoral system with a district magnitude of at least seven is probably the most conducive form of electoral system.  Then, obviously, the electoral system will change.  According to the research, the ideal electoral system is a district magnitude of seven and a proportional representation list system.  However, we have the proportional representation-single transferable vote, PR-STV, system here.  It is a matter of having gender quotas within that proportional representation list system but with placement mandates built into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>That would also be conducive to electing people from diverse backgrounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#G00600","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":755,"content":"<p>That is very interesting.

I thank everyone again for the clear outlines and proposals they have put forward.  I have a long-standing interest in this area.  I also read the 2009 report that we produced in the then Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, and to which Dr. Buckley referred, in which Ireland is described as an \"unfinished democracy\".  At that point, 16% of Teachta Dala&iacute; were women.  It was an appallingly low percentage and much lower than what it is currently.  Of course, one of the recommendations in our report was the introduction of a gender quota, which later transpired in 2012.<\/p> <p>  Helped by the work of Dr. Buckley, Professor Yvonne Galligan and others, we also came up with the four Cs phrase the Taoiseach used yesterday, which outlines the fact that based on the evidence, women face obstacles in progression in politics due to a lack of cash, lack of childcare, the old boys' culture and a lack of confidence.  We then identified the fifth C of candidate selection procedure, which quotas were designed to target and address.  It is really useful to hear the point that quotas did have a positive effect, despite starting from such a low base and with progress apparently having stalled in 2020 with no further increase.  The number of women Deputies increased from 16% to 23% but it is still far too low.  I thank all the witnesses for outlining that and making the link with local politics which, as they said, is not just a pipeline but also a very important form of democratic representation in itself where, again, women are represented in far too small numbers.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a few specific questions about how we change this.  The witnesses put forward great proposals in different ways.  We also discussed this yesterday with the Taoiseach when he appeared before the committee.

I think we all agree with that.  Some of the barriers we ended up discussing at length were low pay and, as the witnesses outlined, the difficulty of juggling a full-time job in the case of many councillors, the supposedly part-time role of a councillor and family or caring responsibilities, which fall disproportionately on women.  These are impeding women from entering local politics but also from staying in local politics.  That has been an interesting exchange.<\/p> <p>  How do we change this?  See Her Elected, in focusing on the rural divide, put those figures very clearly.  Outside of Dublin, the figures are very low and in some counties, they are extremely low.  How should that be tackled?  Quotas are one method and the Citizens' Assembly recommended that we extend quotas to local elections.  There is a difficulty with the sanction.  At national level, we were able to impose the very severe sanction of loss of half of political funding for parties that do not meet the general election quota because, as we know, political funding is tied to general election performance.  Dr. Buckley pointed out the incentivised approach taken at local level whereby parties gain more funds if they meet the quota for local elections.<\/p><p>That is a really sensible proposal and there already are soft measures in this regard.  Will the witnesses expand on that and how we can address the scarcity of women candidates at local level?  When we looked at this issue in 2009, the evidence showed that when women stand for election, they have as much chance as men of being elected.  The barrier is not at the electorate level; the barrier is getting onto the ticket and the support needed in bringing women onto the ticket.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that and the specific measures for both local and general elections.  How would a quota work for local government and what are the other key measures that need to be taken to address the issue?<\/p><p> At local election level, there is not the same commute issue, which is a huge concern in D&aacute;il elections for those with caring responsibilities.  It is not as big an issue at local elections.  At one seminar we held here, a view was expressed that local elections should be great for people with caring responsibilities because local government hours can facilitate, or could be made to facilitate, those responsibilities because the role is supposed to be part-time.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p> What timelines do the witnesses see as necessary to achieve the action plan to get to 50:50 representation by 2030?  The citizens' assembly has given us some timelines.  We have already missed the timeline given in recommendation of No. 20 of expanding the gender quota by the end of 2022.  Are there any other key timelines that should be identified?<\/p><p> On the referendum issue, we in this committee have said it should be held in 2023.  Are there any comments on that?  The Taoiseach told us yesterday the Government is committed to holding a referendum and doing so as soon as possible.  The T&aacute;naiste told us last week a year's lead-in would be needed to run a successful referendum from the date of the decision being made by the Cabinet.<\/p><p> I have covered a lot of issues.  The key question is how we bring forward more women.  What are the key measures needed to address the still shockingly low levels of women's representation, particularly at local level?  I will go in reverse order this time and ask Dr. Buckley to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#G01800","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":767,"content":"<p>On the commute issue, it depends on where a person is located.  It can still be a big issue for local candidates.  In my county, the Cork County Council building is on the outskirts of the city but somebody might be coming up from, say, Castletownbere.  That can still pose an issue.<\/p> <p>  Women are coming forward to stand for election.  We have seen a contagion effect arising from the gender quota at national level.  If we look at the number for women's candidacy at local elections, it has risen from the 314 who ran in 2009 to 560 in 2019, which was something like a 78% increase.  However, that varies across different political parties.  At the 2019 local elections, all parties bar Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael met the minimum 30% threshold.  There is still a need for consistent increases across the board and some incentive measure to encourage the political parties to support women's candidacy and put women forward for election.  There is a need for the extension of the gender quota at local level.<\/p> <p>  Many of the issues we are talking about today have only come to light as a result of women's presence in political institutions.  One of the main reasons for that is the gender quota legislation that was brought in ten years ago, in 2012.  Gender quotas are one part of a suite of packages but they must be there.  If they are not, as we saw prior to their introduction, the rate of increase is very slow.  It is only with women's presence in political institutions and increasing numbers of women in politics that we are beginning to see a lot of the issues we are discussing today coming to light.  Many of the ways, practices and processes of how politics did its business for so long were done under an assumption that politicians were free of caring responsibilities and would not get pregnant.  Many of those practices were in place 100 years ago.  That is why I am still very strong on the need for quotas.<\/p> <p>  The Chair is right that the electorate does not have any bias against women.  The research on this is quite strong and the work of Dr. Lisa Keenan, Dr. Mary Brennan and Professor Gail McElroy on the recent elections confirms it.  It has been a trend for the past ten, 15, 20 or even 30 years.  If the electorate does not have a bias against women and is not discriminating against them but women are still not coming forward, then the key focus should be on the parties as gatekeepers.  We keep having to come back to that.<\/p> <p>  Going back to Senator Pauline O'Reilly's point, and touching on what the Taoiseach has said around the need for wider levels of support, the question arises as to whether there is space within local government for extra administrative supports for the work of councillors.  In research I did with Women for Election and other research I have done with my colleague, Dr. Aodh Quinlivan, in UCC, working with the women's caucus of Cork City Council, this is something that features in the information coming back to us.  If there were more supports on the administration side of the work, that might, as Senator O'Reilly said, assist with the situation whereby most of our councillors are trying to balance their councillor role with employment elsewhere.  In the eyes of the State, the role of a councillor is still very much seen as a part-time one, whereas recent research indicates councillors spend an average of approximately 32 hours per week on council work.  There may be space to treat it more as a full-time role.  I did not hear what the Taoiseach said yesterday but the question of making levels of support available might be something that could be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I have a few brief points to make, one of which follows on from Dr. Buckley's input.  Since 2009, we in the women's manifesto group in Longford have been calling for things like job descriptions for councillors and for it to be seen as a legitimate career path as opposed to something, as Dr. Buckley noted, that is seen as part-time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the change that is needed, as I said earlier, there are a lot of models of good practice.  It is really important to look at the roles of civil society and organisations like ours and Women for Election.  From our perspective in See Her Elected, we are very much a grassroots organisation and very focused on rural constituencies.  We can reach women in rural Ireland, which is really important.  Political education is what will bring about a lot of the change that is needed.  We know women are very enthusiastic and hungry for political education.  We have seen more than 700 women taking part in our online SHE school, particularly during the Covid period.  That appetite is out there and it is really important that organisations like ours continue to be resourced and supported to ensure women have all the information they need through, for example, the guidebook, the associated workshops and so on.  Having that information enables them to make informed decisions about running for office.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the commute for local government candidates may not be the same as it is for the D&aacute;il but, as Dr. Buckley pointed out, in counties like Cork and Galway, it is a long way, say, from east Galway to the Aran Islands.  There are very remote and rural areas in this country we are able to reach by virtue of being a grassroots organisation.  It is really important to bear in mind the role civil society plays in this change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":769,"content":"<p>On the question of the commute, my county of Donegal comes to mind as well.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Chair's reference to the Taoiseach's comment about whether quotas would help to overcome some of the other barriers, I would argue very strongly that they will.  We have research that tells us women wait to be asked to run for election.  When that request comes, it often comes quite late in the day, which means women do not have time to prepare.  Sometimes, the whole election experience can be quite an adverse one for them.<\/p><p>One of the things that now exists, which the Chair asked about, is an action plan from our own perspective in rural Ireland.  We were being asked by women in SHESchool is where do you start if you are not from a political party or if you are not from one of these political families where the council chair has been passed down from grandfather to father to son, which is sometimes what it seems like.  If you are not in one of those families, where do you start?  For the first time in Ireland, there is a starting point and a guidebook that is available to every woman in the country for free to show where to start.  That speaks to the action plan.  To complement that guidebook, there is a strong action plan, which started in November 2021 with ourselves.  We started so early because we wanted to start asking women in 2021, which was years out from the local elections, to start thinking about running or about being part of a campaign team, to get behind a woman who may be an existing councillor or somebody who is new to politics and to start working on those foundations and on that groundwork for their election campaign.  This is crucial in rural Ireland because who you are and your profile need to be established years out, not just from the election but from the selection conventions within the parties, which will be starting as early as next summer.  Women did not know that they needed to be a member of a party to be able to have a vote for themselves.  Of course, they do not need to be a member to be a candidate for it but they do in order to vote for themselves and to bring their own supporters into a party.  That kind of information all feeds into the action plan whereby people put that foundation together and they then can start to build their campaign and canvassing strategies on a rock-solid foundation.<\/p><p> Dr. Buckley spoke about the balancing of the existing councillors.  In the Women&rsquo;s Regional Caucus, there is almost a political experiment going on.  This is because for the first time, we have 42 female councillors across 13 largely rural local authorities.  They were creating for themselves a new political institution within the structures of local government.  They themselves had to slot into existing ways of doing business in county councils.  These are ways of doing business that were established when a woman in there was as rare as hen&rsquo;s teeth.  They did not want to fall into a trap of just replicating the way councils do business.  They were not afraid to experiment either and to see what worked.  For example, plenary meetings are held online where possible and for women who cannot attend because of work outside of their council work commitments, there are summary catch-up meetings.  Any voting is done electronically, with the period of voting being left open for eight or ten hours to allow everybody to participate.  Where I am going with all of that is that things do not always have to be done the way they have been done.  The family-friendly toolkit that was prepared by the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland by Sin&eacute;ad Doody sets out much of that in detail with recommendations for local authorities.  We would like those recommendations implemented.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Maher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":771,"content":"<p>That is great.

In Women for Election's formative years, there was a response to providing training in advance of elections.  This was in response to the need that had been identified when the Lisbon treaty referendum was taking place.  Our founders identified the need because women said they did not know how to access politics.  For ten years, Women for Election have been tailoring programmes to meet the emerging needs.  From approximately 2019, post the local elections, what became more possible was to be able to resource the advanced training programmes, such as our campaign schools like the INSPIRE campaign school and our new EQUIP campaign school, as well as all of the taster programmes and master classes, which have been working to equip women way out.  It is one of the first messages in our campaign schools.  That, along with the work that SHE is doing is quite critical, in order that women can unlock politics far in advance.<br\/><br\/>To address the initial questions, in response to the issue of the deflection by the Taoiseach yesterday on the issue of the quotas, this is not the first time I have heard it and I am disappointed to see that deflection again.  I echo both the previous speakers&rsquo; points on the missed opportunity in 2014 to not to have had quotas in for local elections.  That is what we are feeling now on the ground.  Local politics is suffering because we do not have women right across the country.  At the end of this year, Women for Election is due to launch a new data hub, which is a national mapped dynamic programme.  We are working on it with a number of academics, namely, the All-Island Research Observatory and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is visually mapping the 23 local electoral areas, LEAs, where there are no women.  I happen to live in one in Sligo where there is no woman.  I come from another in Clare in Killaloe where there is no women elected.  To grow up with that and to see that you do not have a choice, it is not even around the policies, but you do not have a choice in 23 of the LEAs.<br\/><br\/>As for the critical piece around the quotas, Dr. Buckley has talked about the financial incentives.  We would go further, and I referred to this in my opening statement, to bring in the penalties as well.  The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly made as a recommendation that penalties would be included and it is important that this is maintained.  We have a package and certainly even an incentive to kick it off but the standard we need to be establishing in politics is not even a target for quotas.  It is that we get to a place where politics is seen as an equal place for our entire society and that the diversity of women and men is represented in our chambers.  It is a critical piece.<br\/><br\/>I am concerned that we will miss the 2024 opportunity.  The 40% D&aacute;il quotas, which will be from 2023 onwards, are putting more pressure on the parties to make sure that they get more women on the tickets but it will not sustain that.  We have no shortage of women who want to come forward and no shortage of women who want to get elected.  Ms Reilly will speak shortly about how those women need to be supported and not having those last-minute advertisements. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the action plan, when I came into the post, I was quite struck that there is no national strategy to get to 50:50.  There is, under the national strategy for women and girls, one action that is held under local government and is focused on local government.  We referred in our opening statement to what we see the need for, which is a stepped-out plan that includes getting the quotas in place before 2024.  It should have all of these.  We have ingredients on the table and we do not have to do an awful lot of soul searching.  I note that Ms Reilly and I are both wearing black and white today.  It is quite straightforward and it is distinctive.  However, what we have not had is a co-ordinated Government response on it.  There are opportunities within the wider recommendations of the assembly to slip that into the gender equality unit in order that there is an agency to hold that but it is a matter of resources.<br\/><br\/>At the moment, we are reliant on donations to continue our work.  It is not feasible for the likes of Women for Election or for SHE to be reliant on <i>ad hoc<\/i>funding when our roles are quite critical.  We look forward to the day that we become redundant and I mean that quite genuinely.  We think it is possible to achieve this work.  Ireland is suffering by not having diversity at the tables.  In terms of the local quotas and into the general quotas, the committee will have National Traveller Women's Forum Ireland before it next week.  Earlier, the work by Dr. Pauline Cullen and Dr. Shane Gough was referred to, and it is quite critical.  We have never elected a Traveller woman anywhere in Ireland to Government, which is a shocking indictment of our democracy.  It is our native ethnic minority population, and we have no representation for it, with the exception of Senator Flynn, who has brought such a contribution in that short time, being nominated to the Seanad.  Among all of the population groups there has been no elected ethnic minority woman locally or nationally to the D&aacute;il.  These are things that have to radically change. <br\/><br\/>On a co-ordinated strategy, I support the full-time role being recognised at local government.  The role is misrepresented in many ways.  There are practical things and I defer again to the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland's toolkit.  We worked closely with the council and with other groups to see things being developed, such as training for chairs and cathaoirligh locally and with even the hybrid meetings in order that meetings will run efficiently.  These long, never-ending meetings are not conducive to that, particularly for people who are time poor, who are predominantly women.  <br\/><br\/>I will speak on a final area, before I hand over to Ms Reilly.  She will speak about work we are doing in Offaly at present, where there is one woman out of 19 councillors and about the resistance we are meeting in doing that work that is focused on women only in Offaly itself.  There is also the area of abuse of women in public life, which we have not really touched on today.  Then there is the issue of security and safety for women in public life, which is disproportionate because while the issue affects men in public life, we have a greater issue in terms of women in public life.<\/p><p>We have legislation that is quite good and there is some coming in that can be strengthened but what we do not have are resourced and trained implementation mechanisms.  The committee will be familiar with my 20 years of previous work in the field of gender-based violence and my credentials.  We do not yet have a system that is effective for anyone who is experiencing gender-based abuse, particularly women.  What I have seen since coming into public life is that politicians are expected to come in wearing a thick skin.  That is not okay and not enough.  We should be able to enter into public spaces and exert a right to represent people without fear or threat for our own safety or our families' safety.  We should commend all politicians who have continued to endure and survived that with a very brave and upfront face.  It is not okay and we need to look at mechanisms around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I will touch on a few points that have been brought up in the discussion.  It is a multifaceted issue and we are trying to touch on all the points here.  Regarding political parties, many parties have their own internal structures to increase diversity and the number of women involved.  That is great but quite often we meet with a certain attitude.  Politics is by its nature competitive but there is almost a trade secrets approach to it.  That is something that women and other minority groups need to be let into.  All have echoed their support for the local quotas today.  They are a short, sharp shock against those decades of incumbency and will help us get over those structural and cultural barriers much faster.  It is a very positive thing for the parties as well because it helps increase the pipeline towards the likes of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  A lot of that starts locally.  We would definitely support that.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on one of the points Dr. Buckley made about the administrative functions and support for those.  We have sometimes come up against this issue.  Even when dealing with councils, there can be a lack of funding for secretariats for women's caucuses.  They are formed as semi-formal or informal structures but often once funding runs out there is no way for that to continue.  We all recognise women's caucuses and the parliamentary women's caucus is a great vehicle to support and maintain women's involvement in politics.<\/p> <p>  Ms Gleeson referred to the Offaly programme we are doing at the moment.  It is fair to say there has been resistance in certain sectors.  It is definitely a reminder of the old attitudes that are out there that we need to counteract.  We need education and information around this, about why we have quotas in place and why there are going to be quotas in place.  I imagine that will meet with resistance as well, unless there is a conversation.  We are definitely leading a conversation on that at the moment but we need to continue that conversation.  We have found, and hopefully it will pay off, that concentrated work is best.  That involves going into a county and doing concentrated work around developing a pipeline of candidates across the various parties supporting women.  That goes back to the party aspect, whereby women need to be supported right from the moment of joining a party up until the moment of candidacy.  It also relates to the issue of not putting women into unwinnable seats and being very clear with candidates.  Oftentimes when people run, they will not win the first time.  That is okay but there need to be honest conversations around that so that women are not met with rejection and are well aware that sometimes it is a long game they are playing.<\/p> <p>  The role of the councillor needs examination.  It is more friendly towards certain professions that allow people to go into council seats.  On the responsibilities of care, we have had discussions with councillors who have said remote meetings are a positive but I worry that it is falling to women on individual councils to have to lobby in order to get remote voting and hybrid meetings in place.  That is a real benefit and we have heard from women with caring responsibilities that it is a real benefit for them as well.  I touched on many points there but hopefully covered it all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Megan Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for those full responses.

That is how long it has taken us to catch up but it is also a sign of how slow we have been with regard to the challenge on our hands and how important this conversation is in terms of what the Parliament of our country looks and feels like.  I have a question about the mechanism for the incentives for political parties.  Last year the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage allocated &euro;150,000 to political parties to increase female participation in the next local elections.  It is expected to provide that funding again in 2022 and 2023.  In order to access those funds, political parties have to set out strategic timelines over the next three years as to how they will support and prepare female candidates in the run-up to the local elections in 2024.  Should the Government consider providing a regular funding stream but attach a condition of local election quotas in order to access those moneys?  Is that the incentive piece or is that the mechanism that could be the incentive piece?  I hear the witnesses loud and clear about the importance of introducing penalties.  Ms Gleeson mentioned the deflection by the Taoiseach yesterday but we have also heard that stalling from the Department around penalties and how we will do this.  I personally would not be that optimistic about the quota being introduced by 2024.  That is hard to acknowledge because the witnesses have outlined the missed opportunity the 2019 elections were.  It seems parties are still trying to come to terms with the idea that we need a quota at local level.

We have the same faces going back 20 years and longer, people who have either inherited seats or are there with an expectation that these are their seats.  I am not mincing my words when I say that.  The resistance we meet when we go into counties, particularly the female deficit counties, is huge.  There is a resistance to our work and there is a resistance to quotas.  These are the people who are voting for the leaders of parties and who will continue to drive political parties.  We see great engagement.  I particularly welcome that incentive scheme from the Government for funding diversity officers and funding roles within the parties.  We are seeing that make a difference at a national party level.

The previous incentive scheme was referred to informally as the headage scheme as it was per head.  The money that is going in is quite small.  It is coming out of the same fund that is funding the initiatives Women for Election, She and other NGOs are running, as well as local councils.  There is a very small pot there.

One of suggestions Women for Election is putting forward - and I have also heard politicians suggest this - is a straightforward fines mechanism based on the turnover of a party on a percentage basis.

We have not been living with 100 years of a male quota; it is a standard.  We have to lift our thinking on this and look at penalising parties when they do not meet a standard.  We are speaking about the core institutions of the State where power affects everybody's lives.  I will not mince words on this.  This is how we have to come at it.  We have been very polite and moving around the edges.<\/p> <p>  I have great regard for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has done tremendous work since he took office.  The officials have also done great work, but they are not involved in overall government.  They are involved in local government and they are not invested in the overall picture.  It is not for civil servants to determine how to change government.  That is not their role.  They are not employed to do this.  This committee has an opportunity to make strong recommendations to drive this forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":782,"content":"<p>It is great to get this clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#L00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":783,"content":"<p>Now that we will have a permanent electoral commission, is Ms Gleeson optimistic about everything that can flow from it?

If we want an incentive measure and if it is not financial, perhaps it could be a list rejection system or something of that nature.  If the nominating bodies do not have a certain proportion of women, in this case we suggest 40%, we could go back and say the list will be rejected and to go away for a number of days or a week and come back with a gender balanced list.  Perhaps this is a way of working around it.<\/p> <p>  I will follow up on what Ms Gleeson said about local elections.  She mentioned that many people have been working on and speaking about local government and how we could operationalise the gender quota.  As Ms Gleeson said we do not have the legal expertise or the constitutional expertise.  We know that State funding of political parties is connected to their D&aacute;il election performance.  This is where finding a mechanism to work towards an incentive measure is coming from.  It is also about tightening up.  The 2019 arrangement was based on 30% or showing improvement in the direction of 30%.  Certainly, we must be very clear if we go down the road of financial incentives that it is tied to 40% and that there is no question about it.<\/p> <p>  Where we do not have legal advice - and I do not know whether it is even possible, but I am throwing it into the mix - is on whether there is a mechanism to change how State funding of political parties is calculated.  Could it be partly based on D&aacute;il performance and partly on performance in local elections?  I do not know.  I am not quite sure.  I do not have the legal expertise.  This is thinking outside the box.  Is this something that could be looked at?  I have heard other suggestions about tying funding to the membership rate of women in political parties.  Is this something that could be looked at?<\/p> <p>  It is quite interesting that there are no legislative gender quotas in the Scandinavian region.  There are voluntary party quotas.  Parties of the left originally introduced them and there was a contagion effect across the party system.  Keeping this in mind, earlier we spoke about a possible role for SIPO or the electoral commission in publishing annual gender and diversity audits of political parties.  If they must concede that they are not performing well, would having available this publicly declared information be an incentive in some respects for parties to attract a diverse base to party membership?  Could funding be linked to women's party membership rates?  Again, this would need more legal and perhaps constitutional research.  I am afraid I am not able to comment any further.  These are some suggestions I have seen or heard being spoken about to try to operationalise a form of quota for all elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Buckley.

When we talk about introducing them in local elections, the question that invariably comes up is about the mechanism by which the quotas are brought in.  It was very clearcut for the general elections because it was tied to political party funding but because that does not exist for local elections, how the parties do local elections does not affect their funding.  <\/p><p> The establishment of an electoral commission is in the programme for Government and there is a research capacity in the terms of reference for that electoral commission.  The Senator has heard the other witness speak about organisations such as ourselves not having that legal expertise.  However, a research capacity within the electoral commission would cede the place to answer the Senator's question.<\/p><p> We were talking about resistance to quotas.  We have done a lot of work with the women's networks within the political parties.  I do not get a sense that there is a resistance to quota for local elections in rural Ireland.  The political parties will talk about supply and demand.  Women who are in SHESchool express a concern that the motivation for the valuable work they are doing in the communities - we all know that if one wants to find women acting politically with a small \"p\" where one finds it is the trojan work they are doing in communities - will be questioned if they declare themselves as candidates.  Thus, they are getting the groundwork in place and waiting for the selection conventions to understand the lie of the land better.  I do not feel in rural Ireland that there is as strong a resistance as perhaps we might think.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Maher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":793,"content":"<p>That is a more optimistic note.  The parties' views being different from the views of individual councillors might be an issue.  Tying funding of political parties to performance in local elections could be done through legislative change.  We looked at it back in 2012 when bringing in the original gender quota and we will examine this again because the citizens' assembly has been very clear.  The resistance was more to do with the whole framework of party funding it that would have been more difficult to unpick the link mechanism than simply to impose what is, in fact, is a very serious sanction of losing half of State funding if they not meet the gender quota for national elections.  That was seen as the simpler way of doing it.  However, there is certainly a gathering momentum about bringing in a quota for locals.  We are committed to implementing recommendations of the citizens' assembly which are very clear that a quota is wanted at every level, including local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#M00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":794,"content":"<p>Many excellent suggestions have been made which will inform the report and it has been a very valuable discussion.  The first of my questions will be about the issue of commuting and rural local electoral areas, LEAs.  What people forget is that it is not just about the meetings of the council.  A considerable amount of the work of a councillor is meeting with people and there is considerable travel involved.  I know there is considerable travel involved in my own constituency.  In the run-up to an election one could be going to three public meetings a night just to try to reach everybody and to hear what people's concerns are.  I am not sure how to address that.<\/p> <p>  When we are looking to get people to run, we have to be honest with people that is what the job entails and that it is not just about the monthly meeting.  Whether that is online or not online is important but it is not the be all and end all.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions around that?  Although it has been helpful that much more of those public meetings are online.<\/p> <p>  What strikes me is the importance of the political parties in this of which we are all aware.  Dr. Maher spoke about the competitive nature of politics which we cannot forget that.  Parties want people to be re-elected in constituencies.  This is why I brought up the issue of winnable seats with the Taoiseach yesterday and, again, did not get a response.  We have not really got a mechanism to ensure that political parties put women in winnable seats, especially the larger parties, because they have many incumbents and they are battling it out against other large parties in those constituencies.  They feel that an unknown person who may not have been elected previously might not stand the best chance.  I am reading between the lines having spoken to an awful lot of politicians, who are men and feel that they have been put at a disadvantage.  However, we have to start somewhere and quotas cannot deal with that.  What else can we do to deal with it?  The solution may be around culture.<\/p> <p>  Volunteers or what some parties will call political activists within their own parties do not fully understand the importance of asking women to run which I know Ms Farrell and Dr. Maher touched on.  I see that more and more.  Most people know that men do not need to be asked and women need to be asked.  That is what all of the research shows.<\/p> <p>  Is there an opportunity for some of the witnesses' organisations to do training for group chairs across political parties in order that it is not just about candidates or campaign managers, but also about informing those who run selection conventions throughout the country at a grassroots level?<\/p> <p>  We have not really touched on social media but it is the number 1 problem women tell me about.  Their biggest concern with entering politics is social media and that kind of exposure.  One is never off.  One is always on.  I get quite disgusting private messages that nobody ever hears about.   I think that women get more of that than men and that is what the research shows.  We cannot leave the committee without having addressed that this fundamental point is putting women off running.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#M00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":795,"content":"<p>It is important to say that the citizens' assembly has highlighted that in recommendation 24 and some of the witnesses touched on it earlier.

There are ways this can be changed with regard to the responsibility and accountability for the platforms that facilitate it and do not manage reporting in an effective way.  There is the tick-box management of reporting and then there is the effective management of it.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to use the word \"training\" but the mechanisms should be there to support women in public life to be able to boundary what it is their are exposed to.  I am on the advisory committee for Meta for women's safety and I am witnessing how there is potential for algorithms to stop the abuse coming.  It should not be there but one of the problems is that we are dealing with a very racist, misogynistic and homophobic world and this is escalated most with bots, trolls and real people doing this online.<\/p> <p>  People should be sanctioned with prosecutions through the legislation we have in place already, of which there is more coming in.  We are trying to change the behaviour.  The platforms can do more but it is the behaviour we are trying to change.  Sanctions are quite critical and their public profiling is also important.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the culture change, in the year and a half since I have come in, I am hearing great commitment from national party levels.  I am seeing great work being done across all the parties and commend that.  I wish to put that on record.  However, I am also seeing resistance.  From 20 years of working on responding to gender inequality in Ireland, I know the subtle resistance.  I know the smile.<\/p><p>What we actually need to do is to address 100 years of the male quota and to call on all our male colleagues, both within the party structures and outside them, to look at male privilege.  Unfortunately, this is going to require men who may have aspirations to run or to run again to see if they really want to have a changed democracy.  Can we start to see men put their hands up and say they will stand aside and create the space for an equally competent woman to be supported to run in a winnable seat?  That is the sort of shift that we will need.  Some 44 incumbents in the D&aacute;il will need to vacate their seats for us to get to 50:50 representation.  That is what it amounts to.  It is that kind of real leadership that is needed from men who are incumbents but also from men within parties.<\/p><p> Asking women to run is really important.  We have the Count Her In campaign running on that basis and encouraging people to look around them.  Unfortunately, women still need to be asked.  Many of the programmes we are working on are looking at breaking down that syndrome of needing to be asked.  Some of the most successful female candidates had to be asked many times before they ran and we understand the reason.  The work and more awareness within parties and the funding coming in around incentivising that should drive that more.  We see some parties doing more than others.  The longer established parties have a bigger mountain to climb, particularly in terms of incumbency.<\/p><p> On the rural commute, as someone who lives in a rural part of Ireland and has the revolving door parenting role running as we speak, that balance of being able to fulfil one's duties as a public representative and one's responsibilities as an employee and as a parent or a carer is something that is challenging when one enters public life but there are ways and we have referred to them a few times.<\/p><p> In terms of hybrid meetings, this meeting is a great example.  They are not resourced as well around the country, so we need some more tech solutions around that.  Dr. Maher touched on that earlier in terms of councils that are doing that well and I think Ms Reilly referred to it.  At the moment women are having to advocate for these to be retained.  There is a pushback coming in from some of the councils.  Covid was a hard time for everybody but it showed us the potential to be more efficient, to be more effective with time and how to make it more accessible.  That is why we refer to the constitutional reform we think is needed, based on the legal advice that is there.  If those in the Parliament can be online and participate in meetings, there is no reason one cannot be online in Falcarragh, Belmullet, Killaloe or wherever one is outside Dublin and participate fully as a Member of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> These are the issues we can address that we did not have to think about 100 years ago when we were designing a Constitution.  They are within our grasp now.  We really urge that shift which could happen if put the whole suite of measures together quite quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":798,"content":"<p>On Senator O'Reilly's piece on the competition I mentioned, as Ms Gleeson said, I think mentorship is really important and individuals within parties understanding the role they can play in encouraging women to go forward.  Training for group chairs was mentioned.  That is something we would definitely be happy to do.  It is really important that we engage with men in this conversation and that we engage with people as early as possible.  That is why we have been trying to have the conversation with schools.  I cannot stress the education piece enough, around having the conversation so that people understand the need for more women in politics.  We are in the county with the lowest representation in local government, with one woman out of 19, and there is still a sense among some people of men being sidelined.  There is going to be an issue when we get to the quotas, which we absolutely need to.

It is correct that this conversation cannot be had without touching on social media.  The regional women's caucus consists of 42 councillors across 13 local authorities.  There is a cohort within that caucus that would express a lack of confidence in promoting their work within their communities because of a fear of saying something wrong or facing a backlash on social media.  However, it is the nature of our electoral system that localism is promoted, so being visible, especially in rural Ireland, is very important.<\/p> <p>  Within our programmes, we deal with the reality of this.  In rural Ireland, with the large distances involved, a canvass might mean getting to three or four houses in an hour given the time spent getting out of the car, opening the gate and going up the lane.  That would be replicated a few times.  It is different in a more urban areas.  Social media, therefore, has to form a key component of an overall campaign strategy for women running in the local elections in rural Ireland.  That is why we build digital self care and self defence into our programmes as part of preparing women for local elections. Outside of quotas, what are the other avenues to get more women involved?  We can have supporting programmes like ours and others and start on time.  It was very important for us to get our guidebook out in 2021.  That contains the importance of raising one's profile well in advance of an election.  As early as Easter 2022, we recommended that women start to do a soft canvass.  It might only be five doors in their local area but we recommended they start that soft canvass.  Perhaps they are not declaring themselves as potential candidates but they are finding out what issues are important to their members.<\/p> <p>  We put a lot of work into preparing for selection conventions.  This goes back to point that political parties are key in all for this.  The selection convention is really the first election and women should treat it as such.  For women who are interested in joining a party or who are in a party, we already have most of them putting their names forward to be local area representatives.  This gives a person some level of standing both within the party and within the community.  The people voting will get to know them and see that they are not voting for them because they are a woman.  Rather, they are voting for them because of what they will be able to do for the community as a county councillor.<\/p> <p>  In my opening statement, I spoke about the importance of quotas as underpinning programmes that are already in place in rural Ireland for the local elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Maher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I have two very quick points.  On the remote access, as Dr. Maher pointed and as others acknowledged, it has been really important for us to be able to access this meeting remotely, given where we are located.  However, it is happening across local councils at the moment.  For example, I have a local community development committee, LCDC, meeting in Longford this afternoon which is being held remotely.  There is a great sense of encouragement from the local authorities to be embracing this technology.  It is really important that is extended across the board.  As women with caring responsibilities, trying to fit in a million other things as well, and who, as Ms Gleeson pointed out, are very time poor, it is very important that the technology is embraced.  The technology is there in many areas.  I know we have an issue with broadband but that is for another day.<\/p> <p>  I will make a very quick point on the incentives and the penalties.  The financial incentives are very welcome.  We would all acknowledge that.  However, it depends on the level of incentive and whether that level is enough to encourage parties to really embrace this meaningfully.  The self regulation we have seen, in particular in terms of gender quotas on boards in other countries, does not work as effectively and the pace of change is too slow.  We are looking to 2024 and ahead to 2029.  We really need to see a lot more efficient action taken on this so that we can see the impact of those measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":801,"content":"<p>On social media, I was interested in a recent paper by the data analyst, Ian Richardson, where he analysed across a year, the tweets directed at public representatives in Ireland.  While he did not identify any significant difference in the level of abusive tweets that men and women in the D&aacute;il were receiving, there was a stark difference at local level and at Seanad level.<\/p><p>Women in local government were getting eight times more abusive tweets than men.  In the Seanad women were getting three times more abusive tweets than men.  It is a very real issue.  We know from UK and European research that the level of abuse that women of colour and LGBTQI+ women get is intensified even more.  What we need to stop doing or what may have been happening in the past was that people were expected to put up with it as there was a sense that this is the cut and thrust of politics.  That approach needs to stop.  Increasingly, we are seeing more people speak publicly about the abuse they are receiving.  That is a difficult thing for a person to do, but it is also very important because it is shining attention on this.  Ultimately, as the political scientist Mona Lena Krook asserts, much of this online abuse is deliberately designed to try to silence politicians and given that women are getting more than men, it is very much trying to silence women's voices and perspectives.<\/p><p> As Dr. Maher from See Her Elected mentioned, the self-care approach is very important, but equally the UN, the Council of Europe and the EU have all recommended that legislation on violence against women in politics be introduced.  If we wish to eliminate it, the penalty must be criminalisation and prosecution of online violence.  They are the mechanisms that need to be looked at to address this.<\/p><p> The other questions and points that were raised about political parties and political party activists asking women to run, that is vitally important.  Both Women for Election and See Her Elected elections will show that women need to be asked to run three to five times.<\/p><p> The other interesting issue that came out of the research we carried out for the More Women: Changing the Face of Politics report that we did for Women for Election, was that many women spoke about not getting any feedback after an election.  They may have contested an election and did not win.  They were then not given any guidance post election, such as a debrief or feedback and they were very much left to their own devices.  As Ms Reilly said, people need to be honest that at the outset a woman might not win and it is important to come back and work with that person to encourage, support and maintain her interest.<\/p><p> Strong political leadership is needed in respect of the selection of women to winnable seats and it has to come from the top.  The leadership simply has to come straight from the top and if there is dissent in political parties, it will need to be dealt with through strong leadership and support from the top level.  That is the key way.  In Ireland we do not have a proportional representation, PR, list system.  We cannot build placement mandates into the list.<\/p><p> It is a completely different issue, but if we were to perhaps start looking at randomising the list of candidates on the ballot paper - currently we list candidates alphabetically - perhaps there would be a mechanism to introduce a form of placement mandate where every second candidate listed is a woman, but legislation would be required to randomise the ballot paper.  I mentioned this 13 years ago at another committee meeting and people in the House with surnames beginning with A, B, and C were not very happy with me when I made that suggestion.

I was laughing when Dr. Buckley spoke about random selection because the witness is named Buckley, the Chair is named Bacik and I am named Boyhan.  We are Bs and I like being up at the top.  It is an advantage and incumbents also have an advantage.  That is an important point to make as according to all the statistics people who are elected and seek election again have an advantage and it has been shown in a lot of research.<\/p> <p>  I only have a few comments to make.  I sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we have dealt with many of the issues this committee has talked about, although perhaps not in as in-depth a manner as this committee has.  I support diverse people coming into politics, including women, men, young people and older people.  If I had my way people would vote and participate in elections at a younger age, but we have not come to that yet.<\/p> <p>  I will share a few thoughts with the witnesses.  I listened to their engagement with the committee on the monitor in my office and there was a recurring theme of political parties.  I am an Independent Senator.  I was elected as a party member.  The party, the Progressive Democrats, subsequently wound down.  I wanted to continue to engage in politics so I became an Independent candidate.  I had an advantage as I had been through the mill but many women who I work very closely with are Independents and were elected the first time out in the last local elections and they are hoping to run again.  That is brilliant.  It is a far tougher operation when candidates are on their own and they have to be self-starters.  I am reminded of a seasoned politician in the Oireachtas who told me not to forget that when we come into the Houses we are all sole traders.  Many politicians talk about being sole traders, which I do not necessarily believe.<\/p> <p>  I will say a few things.  Clearly we want local government and politics generally to reflect the people in society because that is positive.  Sufficient emphasis, money or resources have not been put into mentoring more women, particularly independent women, into politics.  I ask everyone to be mindful of that.  Many people are embedded in their communities in a whole range of community activities and advocacy groups and feel they cannot get into politics or it is not for them.  We need to be mindful that it is not all about the parties mopping up all of the talent locally.  Some people may wish to go the independent route and with that in mind, we have set up a funding mechanism to promote independent candidates entering politics and the Department is funding some of this.  I will be able to share more detail on it.  It is very important and I acknowledge the support from the Department.  It is important that I feed that into the committee's-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#O00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Is that an initiative of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#O00600","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":808,"content":"<p>Yes, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I will feed the information we have on that into the committee because it is important.<\/p> <p>  The local authorities already have a mandate to promote diversity and respect. That is an important point.  I wish all new people coming into politics well.  I will also mention ageism.  I spoke recently to a principal a year after she retired who was active and high up in the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO.  She was a principal of one of the biggest national schools in south County Dublin.  She was a fundraiser for the GAA and immersed in her community through the TidyTowns competition.  When she suggested she might go into politics, she was told she was past it.  She told me she was 66 and had no chance.  I told her she had all the qualities to make a wonderful local councillor.  She asked how to network in and whether she was past it.  Ageism is alive and well in politics, especially in local politics and we are hearing about people being asked to move on and make way.  We want to keep good people in politics and we want to make space for new people coming into politics and that needs to be as diverse as possible.  I come from a local authority, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, that has 40 members, half of them, 20, are women and 20 are men.  That is remarkable and I acknowledge how the councillors and the staff collaborate and work with one another.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely wish the witnesses well and ask them to continue with their good work.  I will offer one piece of advice.  Ms Gleeson was right when she stated earlier that people need to get out there.  It is initially a little bit about the brand and name recognition.  That is the reality.  People want to vote local.  They want contact with local people who are part of the community and are accessible.  I wish them well in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#O00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":809,"content":"<p>Each of the groups might want to comment on the specific point Senator Boyhan raised about support for Independents.

Yes, in Women For Election, as a non-partisan organisation, we work across all political parties and none in terms of encouraging women in.  Since I came in, we have seen nearly 2,500 participants over the past two years on our screens in Zoom meetings.  A number of those women are looking to run independently.  In that diversity we have seen, we are seeing women from all ends of the age spectrum.  We are also doing a lot of work to look at encouraging more women from the later years of life to enter into politics for the first time.  We have a gendered ageism.  In local politics, we have a good cohort of men in retirement who are participating, but we do not have that same career path or retirement plan for women.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of particular issues to raise regarding Independents.  If an Independent candidate wants to run, he or she has to use his or her home address.  Within political parties, there is the option of using party headquarters if there is a concern for safety.  That is something that could be picked up on.  The Senator touched on the issue of the fund.  I am interested in the EnAble fund in the UK as well.  Independents need to have access to cash resources as much as other people running, but they do not have the support of political parties.  It is important for democracy that we are not reliant solely on the party political system and that Independents are supported, particularly where parties do not match the values of people who want to be active.  I would support that.  We ran bespoke programmes this year.  We had sessions specifically on running an Independent campaign where we looked at bringing in expertise on running as an Independent.  That is built into our work and our mentioning programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":811,"content":"<p>Yes.  I heard what was being said about Independents.  We have a lot of women who are not in political parties and are not sure if they are going to join a political party who are contemplating the Independent route.  This is why it was so important that there was a guidebook for the first time with all of the practical information that was perhaps retained within political parties or political families and which is now available to everybody.  It opens up the ability for women to consider running as Independents because they have all of that information in one publication.<\/p> <p>  On ageism, we only need to look at Nancy Pelosi across the sea to see that older women are well able to be part of the cut and thrust of politics.  Something we would hear in our workshops was women saying they are a bit old for it.  That is why we put so much of an emphasis on campaign teams, because older women, whatever their reasons, may not feel that becoming a county councillor is for them right now.  What they do have is a wealth of experience and local knowledge going back over time that makes them valuable people to have on campaign teams to help women get elected.  Any older woman - I would probably include myself in that now - who has survived teenagers and the menopause is well able to survive being in a county council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Maher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I concur with the comments already made.  I thank Senator Boyhan.  When I did work on women Independents who ran in the 2016 general election, it was interesting to note that there was something like a 74% increase in the number of women running as Independents.  I can get the exact figure for the committee; I think it was 74%.  In talking about a knock-on impact of gender quotas, obviously, they do not apply to Independents, but the fact that there were gender quotas gave this impression of the feminising of the political system, if you wish, and a space that was more welcoming of women.  We saw more women coming forward as a result, given the conversation that was taking place around women in politics and the need for more women in politics.  Certainly, we saw a knock-on impact.  Whether it was all down to the quota, we have to dig deeper into that, but it was certainly interesting to observe that, in the first election with a gender quota, we also saw a significant increase in the number of women running as Independents.  There is something there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I was not on the premises so I could not speak until now.  We have covered so much, I am not going to get the witnesses to repeat things.  What was mentioned about Independents is interesting, speaking as an Independent Senator within an Independent Senator group who are all women.  There is something there around the signal it sends and the signal that gets sent.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question.  I bring it up all the time because I think it is important.  It is about support for people who are running.  When you run, you might not win.  We all know that when you run, you may have an unsuccessful first or second outing.  One of the things I have always highlighted is that one of the reasons teachers run is they have a period of paid leave to run for election, regardless of whether they are successful.  There is a set number of weeks - I think it is six; I am not sure - which they can take off to run.  There is a reason many of the people who run are solicitors or self-employed.  In many of the areas where women tend largely to be employed, they are more often likely to be employees.  In many cases they are in the civil society, NGO or caring sectors, for example.  In those situations, in terms of being able to say to your employer that you want to try this thing, to run, that you may or may not succeed but that you do not want to give up your job just to take that chance, will the witnesses comment on the importance of creating a culture where it is acceptable for people to run for public office and return to the role they may have had?  We really saw the roll-on impact in the Seanad.  The previous Seanad was nearly 30% women, but we had four or five group leaders who were women, including the Chair of this committee and me.  It certainly contributed to a dynamic whereby there were many women in very clear roles in the Seanad.  It did lead to a culture shift within the Seanad Chamber, which is now close to 40% women.  There is a positive loop that happens in that regard when you get to a certain threshold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#P00800","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I acknowledge, from previous advocacy roles, the benefit of having that critical mass in the Seanad and witnessing that culture shift.  We are looking to achieve that critical mass in other chambers.  On employment, I cannot recall - perhaps Dr. Buckley can - but I read something recently about that need for employers generally to change their attitudes towards politics.  It raises a question about the wider culture in Ireland around our attitudes towards politics.  For us in Women For Election, we would love to be in a country where politics is seen as a natural career or an actual active citizenship activity as much as participating in local sports or local support to the community or economy is.  That shift then spins into employment.  We can track it in those measures for teachers.  I remember the Senator raising that with us previously.<\/p> <p>  The association of having been in politics and then employment is a very negative one.  It can sometimes affect women and men when applying for jobs, that is, having had an association with politics.  It is a chicken-and-egg situation, but we somehow have to get at that culture shift.  The employment groups and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have a key role.  We raised it with the Minister responsible for higher education recently in terms of extending that teacher space over into the university space.  Again, that is a population where there would, technically, be more downtime available.  Some would argue differently.  Dr. Buckley might be one.  These are the ways in which we can look creatively at the situation.  The Civil Service is another area where there is a bar to participation in politics.  There would be a bar in many NGOs in terms of association with politics.  These are the things we have to look at.  It is a shift.  It is not like politics is a bad thing; it is a fantastic thing.  It is a critical thing for us all to be engaged with from the cradle, or maybe from preschool, right up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101300002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665615600,"counter":815,"content":"<p>One of the recommendations in, I believe, the Moorhead report on the role and remuneration of county councillors was to look at employers being compensated in some way to allow employees to leave and be absent from work to partake in their county council responsibilities.<\/p><p>This is another example of a lack of joined-up thinking.  We have very well researched and funded reports but the issue is to join them all up.  In terms of the recommendation that employers are compensated, there is no reason that the same proviso would not apply for candidates as well.  It is a reality and is one of the reasons programmes like ours prepare women years out from a local election.

We are seeing an increasing movement towards people who identify as left of centre whereas in the past, Ireland would traditionally have been seen as country where voting patters were right of centre.  One could ask whether there are many working-class people represented in our political institutions.

It is a valuable tool for everybody, including purchasers, analysts, policymakers and, I am sure, the Government.  The problem is that we do not have something similar for land transactions.  The market in land is probably one of the most opaque.  It is very difficult to know what land has been sold at what price.  Given land is such a central feature of residential development costs, and it can be one of the underlying speculative elements of rising costs of development, which then result in rising costs for house prices and rents, we need a register of land sales.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the Bill, the call for a register of this type could only happen if the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, was transferred over to Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  I will speak to this aspect separately, in keeping with the guidance of the Chair.  I am not going to press this amendment.  I am, however, interested in hearing the thinking of the Minister of State and the Department regarding the idea of having such a register and whether it would be something the Government will at least actively consider because it would be such a valuable tool for us all to have.  If we can do this for residential property prices, then I fail to see why we cannot do this for land transactions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022101300002#B00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":843,"content":"<p>This group of amendments relates to the information to be collected and made available by Tailte &Eacute;ireann under a new section 8.

I very much appreciate the objective of the Deputies' amendments, but there are several reasons I wish to put forward for my disposition not to accept them.<\/p><p>The intention of the Bill is to bring about the merger of Property Registration Authority, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Valuation Office, which includes the transfer of the current functions of these bodies, into Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  It is not envisaged that the current functions of the existing bodies will be expanded during the merger process.  Under section 23(6) of the legislation, &quot;Tailte &Eacute;ireann may, from time to time, prepare and submit to the Minister such other reports in relation to its activities as it considers appropriate&quot;.  In addition, under section 23(7), &quot;the Minister may give a direction, in writing, to Tailte &Eacute;ireann to prepare and submit to him or her a report, in writing, not later than such date as the Minister specifies in the direction, in relation to any particular matter relating to the functions of Tailte &Eacute;ireann as the Minister considers appropriate&quot;.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, to separately legislate for specific reports as is envisaged by the proposed amendment.<\/p><p>On the data currently available on residential property sales prices, the Property Registration Authority maintains, and Tailte &Eacute;ireann will take on this task on its establishment, the national land register, which is electronic, publicly accessible and searchable by anyone online at <i>www.landdirect.ie<\/i>.  A considerable volume of information is available in that database.  Search results give a description of the property, the date of registration, details of the owner and any burdens relating to the property, such as a mortgage or a right of way.  Associated spatial data are also available.  Under current land registration legislation and rules, however, the national land register does not record property prices.  The property price register, maintained by the PSRA currently under the remit of the Department of Justice, holds information on residential properties by description only and includes the price and date of sale.  There is no associated spatial aspect.<\/p><p>Furthermore, under Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s housing plan to 2030, the Department is committed to evidenced-based policy development and will continue to improve data availability and analysis.  This includes working with the local government sector to ensure planning and housing data are captured in a nationally-consistent structure to enable monitoring of national housing development and construction.<\/p><p>The Department is currently working with Ordnance Survey Ireland to develop a national zoned housing land register based on local authority development plans, including the potential housing yield-capacity, which can also form the basis for the associated calculation of land use values required for the land value sharing measures also currently being developed under action 12.1 of the Housing for All policy.Provision is made in the Registration of Deeds and Titles Act 2006 for the maintenance of a register of deeds and the information to be contained within it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022101300002#B00500","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister of State will depart a little from his script in his response to my second question, though I appreciate that he must give us the official position.

I hope he understands this aspect.  What I am really asking, because the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, made it clear earlier that the Government is not going to insert provision for this register into this legislation, is whether the Government thinks that such a register would be a good thing.  I think it is eminently sensible and would be a very valuable tool.  Notwithstanding that the Minister of State is not minded to support its inclusion here, is its introduction something the Government would actively consider?  I am asking this because all the other things mentioned by him which are all valid, do not do what such a register would do, which would be to give us real-time information on land transactions.  This would be valuable because it would provide the State, as it becomes more involved in active land management, which is something we all want to see more of, with information regarding where the pressure points are, where speculative investment is being made and where we would like to see active land management interventions, either by the Land Development Agency or other bodies.<\/p> <p>  The fact that we do not have this information, even if we do have a land register, means we do not have a real-time land transactions register and that we are operating blind.  I fully understand the position the Minister of State has outlined regarding the amendments, but I ask him to tell us if there is a discussion ongoing in the Department about this kind of initiative, if it is something the Department could consider and if the Department could discuss it with the Department of Justice, so long as the PSRA remains within the ambit of that Department?

The national land register is a legal register that operates under a non-conclusive boundary system and is subject to the rights of those in possession.  Where anomalies appear, the Property Registration Authority, PRA, can update the map under set protocols and in the absence of dispute.  There may be instances where a property was mapped many years ago, and the boundary on the ground now is not as it was at the time of registration.  Boundaries can change over time for a variety of reasons and procedures exist to rectify boundaries on consent.  Otherwise, disputes are a matter for resolution through the courts.  There is no intention to change the statutory legislation grounding the functions of the Property Registration Authority, Ordnance Survey Ireland or the Valuation Office.<\/p> <p>  Tailte &Eacute;ireann, when established, will be independent in the performance of its statutory functions, including the registration of title function.  The PRA registers in accordance solely with the deeds, documents of title and maps lodged on application.  Appeals arising from decisions made by it are a matter for court by way of appeal under section 19 of the Registration of Title Act 1964.  This will not change when the legislative functions of the PRA pass to Tailte &Eacute;ireann under the Act.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the argument made by the Deputies, it would be a very significant and difficult piece of work across the country given the number of pieces of land involved.

To be clear, in the first instance, what the amendments are asking, and what I am asking the Minister of State to informally raise within the Department, is a review of the digitisation process.  In the village in which I live, Clondalkin, there are large parts of the area where there are no title deeds at all and, for example, nobody owns the entire main street, most of the pathways and so on.  We have dealt with a number of anomalies where title deeds did not exist or were disputed.  In fact, when I went to my director of services for planning and development some years ago and asked them to do a review, they said it would take so much time and effort that they did not have the resources.  I am not asking for a review of all title deeds and the historic development of those because that would be too onerous.  However, a tight review of the digitisation process to examine even a small number of pilot areas or a small number of case studies to identify the extent to which that digitisation process was successful or not could be a helpful tool.<\/p> <p>  While I accept the argument around operational independence, I still think, because it is a State agency and under the remit of the Department, that some consideration of the proposal in front of the Minister of State would be merited.

However, as I have the opportunity, I want to make the case for the Department to reconsider this issue.  The Property Services Regulatory Authority, as the Minister of State knows, is a very weak body and it has a very weak statutory underpinning and a voluntary code of conduct.  The sectors under its aegis are very significant property service management companies, estate agents, auctioneers, valuers and so on.  We all know of many stories where individuals who are looking to purchase or sell homes find navigating that process and dealing with the concerns they have about how the process operates very difficult.<\/p><p>There is a strong argument for either the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of Justice to at some point revisit the legislative underpinnings of the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  I know that is not for us today.  The reason I tabled the amendment is because I have a strong view that so long as the Property Services Regulatory Authority sits within the Department of Justice, this will never happen and it will be very low down on its priorities given that, alongside the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it is one of the busiest Departments in terms of legislation.  This will never get on the radar of the Minister for Justice or the Secretary General or assistant secretary general in the Department of Justice.  Therefore, I have made the case for a number of years that the Property Services Regulatory Authority should be under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which makes much more sense.  Its functions have to do with the regulation of bodies that value houses and buy and sell houses or land, and property services management companies.  The logical place would be this Department.<\/p><p>I also think, and the pre-legislative scrutiny report of our committee recommended, that this agency would be a good place to have that.  Yes, it would be a significant expansion of its remit but one that is warranted.  I know the Minister of State is going to read out the statement and tell me why he is not accepting the amendment, which is perfectly fine, but I would have thought any reasonable person would have accepted the logic of at least active consideration of first transferring the Property Services Regulatory Authority into the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and then to consider whether it would sit within Tailte &Eacute;ireann, where I think it would sit quite nicely, or somewhere else.<\/p><p>In the previous D&aacute;il our committee wanted to have public hearings on the operations of the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  Many of us represent constituents who live in apartments and there are ongoing issues about the operation and regulation of property service management agents.  This committee cannot look at that issue because it does not fall within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Despite the fact we asked the Committee on Justice to consider it and invite us along, it never fitted within its programme and it had other work to do.<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State is not accepting it and that he is going to tell me this is the wrong legislation and that it broadens the scope of the Act too much, and that is all fine.  However, I ask that he would take it away and look at it and, again, maybe ask the Minister to come back to our committee to see if this is a conversation that can be had.  Today, we have many reports of allegations - they are only allegations - of fake auctions when people are bidding for homes.  Somebody puts down a deposit on a home and then they are told that somebody else is raising the price, and there is no visibility, accountability or transparency.  We know people who have put down deposits on homes only for the seller to withdraw and for the property to be back on the market several months down the line when the property price has increased further.  We get complaints about certain auctioneers and valuers who, again, are alleged to have questionable practices.  All a person can do today, if they feel they are not being served properly by that system, is make a complaint to the Property Services Regulatory Authority, which, with its voluntary code of conduct, can write an angrily-worded letter to the agency involved, but the system does not improve.  Other European jurisdictions have much more transparent and accountable systems for valuation, auctioneering and property transactions.  The fact we have not done it in this Bill is a missed opportunity but, nonetheless, it is one the Department should still actively consider with its counterparts in the Department of Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022101300002#C00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I note it was a cross-party recommendation from this committee in our urban regeneration report.<\/p><p>It is worthy of consideration, whether it fits within this Bill or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022101300002#C00900","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":860,"content":"<p>In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, he thanked this committee for its efforts in producing our pre-legislative scrutiny report, even though the Government did not accept either of our two eminently sensible recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022101300002#D00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":861,"content":"<p>It was included as a recommendation in our urban regeneration report too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022101300002#D00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1665615600,"counter":862,"content":"<p>This is beyond my role.
