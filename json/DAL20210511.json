This morning, a report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has highlighted again the crushing cost of housing, including extortionate rents, which far exceed their pre-crash heights, as well as a collapse in homeownership amongst this generation of young adults.<\/p>  <p>  It is not lost on these young people, their parents or their grandparents that the housing crisis was created by Fianna F&aacute;il, which left the housing market in hock to developers and deepened by Fine Gael, which could not wait to let the vulture funds loose.  The result of all of this is that those looking to put a secure and affordable roof over their heads do not stand a chance.<\/p>  <p>  At a time when the Government should be moving heaven and earth to do everything possible to make housing affordable again, what is the Government doing?  It is still enabling and encouraging wealthy investment funds to buy up family homes with cushy tax deals.  The Government claims that this is a new phenomenon or an unintended consequence but that is not true.  In 2019, six out of ten new homes in Dublin were taken off the market and the vast majority were sold to the investment funds.  In the past four weeks, 400 houses have been snapped up by these funds.  <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, they are not stopping with Dublin; their plan is now to spread their wings across the State.  These investment funds are now moving to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway, with leading developers saying that they will be selling more than 40% of their new homes to these funds in the years ahead.  It is a very daunting prospect for young people who scrimp and save and make enormous sacrifices to put themselves in the position, if they are lucky, to have a deposit to buy a home.  Yet, these investment funds not only rob people of the chance to buy their own homes but also push up house prices, in some cases by as much as &euro;80,000.  <\/p>  <p>  All of this happens against the backdrop of the publication of the utterly discredited Affordable Housing Bill 2021 by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the provision of an affordable housing plan that can make houses even more expensive.  Even by the Government's standards, that is some achievement.  Is it any wonder then, that the mood of a generation is one of exasperation?  The Government's sweetheart tax arrangements allow these investors to lock people out of homeownership and force them into the private rental market, where these same funds then charge extortionate levels of rent.  Heads, they win; tails, they win; it is a win-win for the investment funds.<\/p>  <p>  There are things the Government could do right now to make housing more affordable.  It could double the State's capital investment in affordable and social housing.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have called for that action to be taken and the ESRI has echoed that call.  The Government could cut the legs from the vulture funds by doing that.  It could cut rents and put a month's rent back into the pocket of every renter through a tax refund.<\/p> <p>It could legislate to prevent any further rent increases.  Above all, what it could do is legislate to end the sweetheart tax deals and remove the financial incentive and advantage accruing to these investment funds.  However, it has done none of those things.  The Cabinet met today.  People are waiting to hear from the Government about its plan is to stop these vulture funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620738300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>First, I have to say that the Government is ten months in office.  During those ten months, we have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic which has had a huge impact on the people and, indeed, on sectors of our economy.  It has also had an impact on the construction industry.  Notwithstanding that, the Government has committed to, and provided the funding for, the largest multi-annual social housing programme in the history of the State.  That is the core of the Government's policy programme.  A total of &euro;3.3 billion is allocated this year to new house construction.  We want to build 9,500 new social homes.  The State and Government are also getting involved in building, and supporting the building of, affordable homes through a variety of schemes.  The Government has initiated the first national cost-rental scheme, which will provide houses at rents 25% below the market price.<\/p>  <p>  I have said, and I have made it clear to my Government colleagues - along with the leaders of the other parties in government - that we are committed to ensuring that housing is our number one, collective responsibility as we emerge from Covid-19 in order to give young people an opportunity for home ownership.  That is something I am passionately committed to and that we provide enough social housing for those who need it.  In addition to the allocation and funding we are putting in for housing, we are making sure that unprecedented amounts of funding are going to infrastructure to make sure the houses can happen, in terms of the allocation of money to Irish Water to make sure we can get water services in place for these housing developments, and also wider infrastructural developments such as the docklands in Cork or the development in Galway and Limerick that will facilitate more residential units being built and more housing being built.<\/p>  <p>  That is the story of this Government's programme for housing and no amount of distortion will change those facts.  We remain committed to that but we have to do more.  Development finance for builders is problematic in this country.  It has been problematic for quite a number of years in terms of the cost of funding for builders to get going and build housing estates.  We need builders to build large housing estates and also to build smaller housing estates and smaller housing units.  The fundamental issue at stake in housing is supply, supply, supply.  That is it.  That is why there is an onus and responsibility on all politicians of all parties to do everything we possibly can to support the supply of housing.  That is why Deputy McDonald's party also has questions to answer in terms of the serial objections to quite substantial housing programmes and projects that have been voted down on too many occasions, whether it be in Tallaght, where her party voted down 500 houses that could have been built, or in Clondalkin, where 800 to 900 houses, again, were opposed.  That cannot go on.  Maybe it is in the Deputy's interest to frustrate the attempts to get housing built or to impede progress.  The biggest actor in housing right now, the biggest player, is this Government, through a whole range of vehicles and schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the investment funds that came into the country more than eight or nine years ago, we are very clear that we are opposed to investment funds taking over or buying estates that have already been built.  The original purpose and objective of them was to add to supply, not to take over existing supply and compete with first-time buyers or, indeed, approved housing bodies or councils for that matter.  Our priority remains the first-time buyer.  We want home ownership to increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1620738300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100004#B00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1620738600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in has opposed every single measure that this Government has taken to provide affordable housing to people and it did likewise in previous years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100005#C00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1620738600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The welcome mat was laid out for these investment funds long before Covid-19 was ever heard of.

The High Court yesterday quashed a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la yet again.  The board had granted permission for 123 apartments at a site on the Old Fort Road in Ballincollig.  That is place I know well and I am sure the Taoiseach also knows it well.  This is not an isolated judgment.  Month after month, the courts are striking down decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, particularly planning decisions taken under strategic housing provisions of the 2016 Act brought in by the Taoiseach's constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  Last December, the High Court quashed a permission that An Bord Plean&aacute;la had granted for more than 660 homes in Rathmullan in Donegal.  In other cases, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is simply holding up its hands.  In March of this year, it consented to a High Court order quashing its permission for 614 residential units on RT&Eacute; lands at Donnybrook.  In July 2019, permission for 221 housing units at Cross Avenue in Blackrock, County Dublin, was dismissed because An Bord Plean&aacute;la had not gone through enough public participation, a basic requirement of planning law.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, the Labour Party is very supportive of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, its structure and use, and the need for it.  I do not think any party in this State has a stronger history than the Labour Party when it comes to having independent planning regulatory processes in place.  We have paid the price and taken lawsuits for that down the years.<\/p> <p>There is an issue here, however.  In its annual report for 2019, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refers to 17 judgments in the courts.  The board was only successful in having its decisions upheld in nine cases.  Its decisions were overturned in eight cases, and in seven other cases, it accepted there was a legal deficit in its decision process.  That means 15 out of 24 cases were, therefore, lost.  How many units are lost because of that?  Given the crisis we are in, it is not good enough.<\/p> <p> In 2015, I established a review group, chaired by Mr. Gregory Jones QC, to undertake an independent organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which produced an excellent report comprising 101 recommendations over 257 pages. <\/p> <p> Does the Taoiseach accept that the frequency and regularity of successful court challenges to strategic housing developments demonstrate a fundamental problem with either the proper functioning of An Bord Plean&aacute;la or a serious deficit in the 2016 legislation or both and-or a lack of resources in the board, which the board stated is the case in its recent national development plan, NDP, submission?  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the implementation of all the recommendations of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la review group is prioritised, given that it is now five years since the report, which I dare say he supported, came in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100005#C01800","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620739200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a very important issue.  I take on board the points he has made.  It is a cause for concern that quite a high number of those judgments were overturned or that seven were voluntarily owned up to and deficits were acknowledged in terms of the decisions.  In the first instance, this means An Bord Plean&aacute;la must reflect on its process and due diligence regarding decisions that are taken, which subsequently do not stand up in the courts process.<\/p>  <p>  It also speaks to a wider issue in respect of the planning process more generally and whether we need to reform that process.  The idea of a planning court has been mooted with a view to making sure we can get decisions that give greater certainty to all concerned, both those who appeal and those who are appealed against.  That could mean a more streamlined, efficient and effective planning system.  These are projects that are being held back and houses or apartment blocks that could be built.  That is not optimal or acceptable either.  Many investment decisions have been held back for far too long now in the system.  Our system is not optimal in terms of the future of our economy and in facilitating good investment.  In some instances, it takes far too long and then, as the Deputy noted, deficiencies arise at the eleventh hour, which perhaps should have been spotted much earlier and should never have got to the stage of a High Court or Supreme Court case before they were highlighted.<\/p>  <p>  I have discussed this with the Attorney General and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we are examining proposals.

The area suffers from extremely high levels of long-term unemployment.  In 2016, 40% of men and 26% of women in the Tipperary east urban are were unemployed.  Some 40% of the households in the town are rented, half of which are socially rented from the local authority.  This points to income levels and a lack of employment opportunities.  Third level attainment is approximately half the national average, pointing to social deprivation issues in early childhood, 15% of the population identifies as non-Irish national and 36% of all families with children under the age of 15 are headed by lone parents.  The social deprivation index for the town is quite stark.  It is categorised as very disadvantaged.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, led by March4Tipp, 5,000 people took to the streets in a massive show of community resolve and determination.  This was a cry for help which resonated nationally.  I, along with community groups, called for the establishment of a multi-agency task force to address the massive problems facing the community.  I am glad the task force is working diligently and effectively with the co-operation and support of multiple local organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The most significant socioeconomic problem facing Tipperary town is the ever-increasing heavy traffic which travels through it on a daily basis.  Each week, more than 85,000 traffic movements occur through the centre of the town, stifling retail and other economic activity and choking the very life out of the town.  When one adds to the mix the massive post-Brexit increases in traffic in and out of Rosslare Europort, it is apparent that the town is at breaking point.  Shops and other businesses struggle to keep their doors open in an environment where shoppers cannot park or move about safely.  Many businesses have, unfortunately, succumbed to the pressure and closed their doors.  The commercial vacancy rate in Tipperary town, at 31%, is higher than that for towns in most other counties.  Traffic on the N24 is killing the town.<\/p>  <p>  The whole community rejoiced when the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, agreed with my proposal that the planned Cahir to Limerick Junction N24 project needs to be prioritised, with the section that will bypass Tipperary town being commenced and completed as a priority.  Prioritising the section around Tipperary town will deliver the best results for the long-suffering local community and in the context of the flow of goods throughout the wider region.  The opportunity to make a profound and lasting difference to the future of Tipperary town is within our grasp.  Will the Taoiseach deliver vital help to a very deserving town and community?

All Oireachtas Members from Tipperary are united in revitalising Tipperary town and addressing social disadvantage and deprivation there.  As the Deputy said, the entire community came together publicly to demonstrate its concerns but, above all, its objectives in terms of revitalising the town and its hinterland and providing for greater social inclusion.<\/p> <p>The task force has been created.  The recruitment of a dedicated project manager and the production of the collaborative town centre health check have taken place as part of the contributions by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I am interested in working with the task force and all involved in a multi-agency approach, which is key and essential.<\/p> <p> Traffic congestion in Tipperary town is very severe.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met all the local Deputies on 12 March.  He agreed that there were congestion issues in the town and that there was broad support for a bypass.  The Deputy is correct in identifying the Minister's preferences in terms of the review of the NDP.  In that context, the Minister is keen on the option for smaller bypasses which address immediate congestion in town centres and can be delivered on a shorter timescale to support the town centres first strategy.  It will need further development and consideration and it is under active consideration by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in consultation with the Cabinet economic committee in respect of those issues.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Lowry knows, the NDP includes the proposed N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction improvement scheme, which includes a bypass of Tipperary town.  I am aware that opinions have been expressed in Tipperary County Council that a short-term relief road should be built to the south of the town in an effort to immediately relieve the congestion that exists there, rather than wait for the completion of the major scheme.  These are issues we will actively consider.  We understand the urgency and importance of it but also the broader picture that, where we have communities that need additional help and assistance, we should, across all Departments, go the extra mile in facilitating and doing things rather than putting them on the long finger.

In many villages and towns where in there are little or no employment opportunities, we are fortunate enough to have these agricultural merchants.  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, we have many agricultural merchants who provide an important source of employment for a large number of people.  We are fortunate to have agricultural merchants such as John Grennan &amp;amp; Sons in Kilcormac and Rath and we have Midland Veterinary in areas like Tullamore, Edenderry and Portarlington.  These are towns that are badly affected by unemployment.  That has been the case for decades.  It is very important that our agricultural merchants sector is protected and that we do everything possible for it.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, a number of threats are posed to the agricultural merchants sector.  One of these is an EU requirement to come into force in January whereby all veterinary medicinal products, including antiparasitic drugs, will only be dispensed on foot of veterinary prescriptions.  In addition, an EU directive which allowed for the exemption and maintenance of non-prescription status in respect of some products is to be scrapped.  When I raised this matter eight months ago, the Taoiseach stated that he did not want a position to develop whereby people would be rendered unemployed as a result of the application of this EU requirement.  Unfortunately, we are eight months on from that commitment and the likelihood of job losses has gathered momentum.<\/p> <p> Agricultural merchants have engaged throughout the process constructively and in good faith by means of a multisectoral forum but they are increasingly of the view that the entire consultation process was never going to do anything but deliver a predetermined departmental outcome.  This is despite the fact the veterinary director of the Health Products Regulatory Authority has clearly stated that when it comes to the prescribing of antiparasitic drugs, agricultural merchants are \"not the root of the problem\" and that licensed merchants have made and continue to make a valuable contribution in this area.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department have made it clear, however, that they have no intention of changing their interpretation of the regulations for prescribing antiparasitic medicines.  This is despite widespread condemnation from farmers, farming organisations, horse owners, pharmacists, licensed merchants, co-operatives, MEPs and the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine.<\/p> <p> The new regime, if allowed to be introduced, will effectively eliminate the category of \"responsible person\" from the list of those allowed to prescribe these medicines.  This is completely unjustified.  What is the Taoiseach going to do?  This is going to have a serious impact on employment and on the 140,000 beef and sheep farmers who will be disproportionately affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100008#F00400","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620740400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>As I have said, this relates matter to the transposition of an EU directive, which is an obligation on all member states of the Union.

There are safety and animal health protection dimensions to this as well.  For example, Ireland is still the only country in Europe that does not require prescriptions for antiparasitic treatments.  That is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  We want to get a solution that will enable the sector to continue to provide its valuable services to farmers the length and breadth of the country.

We will do what has to be done in order to ensure a level playing field across this country and put in place a framework that will fulfil our obligations under the directive without imposing additional undue burdens on the businesses concerned, the sector or the farming community.

I have a simpler question concerning the potential to bring a motion to the UN Security Council demanding that Israel halt settlement expansion in the Occupied Territories.  I believe that could be a real sign of leadership.  New Zealand, a country of similar size to ours, did it in 2016.

I believe the only way we can work on this island is for all politicians from all persuasions to engage in the democratic process and dialogue, as well as to seek to reach understandings on common ideas and projects.  The shared island initiative that we have undertaken is designed to be a constructive dialogue and engagement with all sectors on the island of Ireland.  This includes research projects, industrial joint projects, education and infrastructural and amenity projects like the Ulster Canal and the greenways projects and much more.  We have provided half a billion euro in funding to enable us to do that.  We are working on a whole range of projects in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We will do everything we possibly can to allay the fears of certain sectors of society in the North.  However, we also need to move strongly in respect of working with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive on educational disadvantage, school completion and supporting young people in communities that do not have a tradition of school completion or progression to further and third level education.  We must take the initiatives to alter that once and for all and create a new paradigm for young people born into certain communities within Northern Ireland who have not had that experience or tradition.  That needs to change in terms of the future of Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On legacy issues, I believe that the framework is there in terms of the Stormont House Agreement of 2014.  There can be no unilateral changing of what has been agreed between two Governments and all of the political parties in the North.  In my view, the victims and those killed by state security forces, the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries need justice and there must be accountability.  We have always been conscious of the needs of victims and the need to prioritise their needs in dealing with legacy issues.  The legacy issues have dragged on for far too long.  Too many families are without closure or the satisfactory provision of information and transparency around the death of their loved ones, often in very brutal and savage circumstances.<\/p> <p>In my view, that is something we have to continue to keep in mind.

There have been lots of comprehensive inquiries under way in regard to collusion.  Operation Kenova - or Project Kenova, or whatever title it has - is going on at the moment.  It is a very widespread investigation in terms of Stakeknife and all that and the engagement between elements within the paramilitaries and state security services.  We need the truth to all of this.  We need to understand what happened and the victims and families, in particular, need to understand.

We are close to a resolution on this now at European Council level and I anticipate, at the next Council meeting perhaps, that we should have agreement on it.  It is important funding, particularly for sectors that have been affected and impacted most by Brexit, in the regions and rural Ireland in particular.<\/p>  <p>  On the shared island funding, we have allocated moneys.  At the last North-South Ministerial Council plenary before Christmas, we indicated a number of areas for funding, particularly the Ulster Canal.

A total of &euro;12 million is for phase 2 and &euro;1 million is to get the design ready for phase 3.  We want to complete the Ulster Canal project in its entirety, utilising the funding in the shared island fund and the regeneration funding.  That is a very good project in itself.  We are also looking at a joint industrial project, partnering with City Deal in Derry, to provide an industrial complex on the Derry side and on the Donegal side.  That is in partnership with the North West Regional Development Group.<\/p>  <p>  We have already funded some minor research projects under the shared island funding itself.  People can bid for up to &euro;20,000 in funding for research projects.  There is also a more substantive research piece being developed in partnership with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and his Department in respect of collaboration between third level institutions on the island of Ireland on issues of mutual benefit to the island.  That could be cybersecurity, for example, or it could be climate.  There will be competition for that funding and it is intended that the universities or institutes of technology would bid for it.  We have also committed to the A5 and to Narrow Water Bridge and we have some work to do to get them going.  These are the projects that have been committed to already under the fund.  We have also invited community groups and so on to put forward ideas for further funding.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy McDonald, I have met all the North-South bodies and gone through the fund with them.  We stand in support of the bodies in respect of any particular projects they may have under their aegis, to get those projects going, from Ulster Scots to the Irish language to a range of other projects on the tourism side, for example, which could give a very interesting North-South dimension for people travelling North and South and tourism coming in from overseas.  There is a good list of healthy projects and I can arrange that some briefing be made available to the Deputy in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the North-South Ministerial Council, my understanding is that the next meeting is due in June, which is important.  As I said earlier, with the situation within the DUP and the election of a new First Minister, we obviously must await the outcome of that election.  The outgoing First Minister has made it clear and articulated publicly that they are not boycotting the North-South Ministerial Council.  My view is that there is a very clear obligation on all signatories to the Good Friday Agreement to honour the agreement and participate in these North-South meetings, which are important in terms of the wider issues.<\/p>  <p>  On PEACE PLUS, it has been a very successful round.  We secured &euro;120 million in an initial allocation from the European Union.  That, of course, gets matched by the Government, the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  It is now estimated that up to &euro;1 billion, through all the matched funding, will be available for PEACE PLUS.  There has to be some work done between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the other relevant stakeholders in terms of the operationalisation and allocation of that fund.  It is an exciting project in itself.<\/p> <p>There is a substantial amount of money there, which illustrates the continued benefits of European Union membership and also reflects the Union's interest in peace on the island of Ireland.  The EU has made a long-standing commitment to that peace.<\/p> <p> I recall when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs many years ago, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in had difficulties and we were in Downing Street.  It was just after we had lost the first Lisbon treaty referendum, which was about the only subject at that time that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in agreed on.  Both parties were happy that we had lost the first referendum, though, thankfully, the second referendum was won.  I make the point that the European Union's interest in the North has been positive and constructive.  The EU sees it as one of the success stories in terms of peace processes across Europe.  <\/p> <p> Europe is sensitive to the current issues and Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic and Mr. David Frost are now engaged in a process that I hope will facilitate a working through of some of the issues that have arisen in respect of the protocol.  I hope we can have a constructive engagement on that front because it is important.  We must all work collectively to reduce tensions on an ongoing basis.  We will have ongoing interactions with the British Government in respect of the need to ensure that whatever we do, we do it with a view to maintaining stability and peace, defusing tensions, and enabling the workings of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement as effectively, efficiently and peacefully as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100018#Q00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","time":1620744900,"counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R00200"},{"type":"question","time":1620744900,"counter":183,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[21617\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the public service, justice and police reform division of his Department.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1620744900,"counter":184,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[21776\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the social policy and public service reform division of his Department.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1620744900,"counter":185,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[21778\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the social policy and public service reform division of his Department.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1620744900,"counter":186,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[22858\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the public service, justice and police reform division of his Department.","asker":"1489","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1620744900,"counter":187,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[24140\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the social policy and public service reform division of his Department.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1620744900,"counter":188,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[24141\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the justice and police reform division of his Department.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1620744900,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, 43 and 44 together.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the social and public service reform division is to assist me, as Taoiseach, and the Government in delivering programme for Government objectives on public policies and services which help create a socially inclusive and fair society.

That commitment has not been fulfilled and I urge him to act swiftly to rectify that.  In order to access legal advice, the families must apply for legal aid for the inquest into the deaths of their loved ones.  The process is intrusive for all families due to the volume and breadth of documentation and personal information they are required to submit.  A number of families have been refused access to legal aid as they own their own homes.  It is unimaginable, having had to battle the State for four decades to secure this inquest, for the State to now block their access to legal advice.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice could resolve this matter quickly.  Section 29(2) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides for a discretion to waive the requirement of the financial eligibility test.  Section 37 of the same Act states that the Minister may make such regulations.  The Legal Aid Board has confirmed that, in the absence of the Minister's regulations, it cannot and will not waive the financial eligibility test.  When my colleague, Deputy Doherty, raised this matter with him in committee two weeks ago, the Taoiseach committed to pursuing the matter on behalf of the families.

One particularly unjust example of a school that has missed out is Knockmore Junior School in Killinarden, a DEIS - Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools - school with 149 young pupils.  The situation is particularly unjust because many of the other schools in the area have access to hot school meals, which is great, but means that the brothers and sisters of some Knockmore pupils will be getting the hot school meals they need while their younger brothers and sisters will not be getting that access.

We have unacceptable waiting lists in this country for mental health services.  Thousands of children, teenagers and adults are on waiting lists for mental health services and they are often urgently in need of counselling and psychological treatment.  I have met three times with psychology students, most of whom are young but some of whom are older and have gone into psychology later in life.  The most extraordinary barriers are being put in front of those students attempting to get doctorates in psychology.  They must work as assistant psychologists without pay.  Posts have been advertised recently to that effect and those are not isolated examples because the practice is going on all the time.  People are paying extortionate fees for an education and counselling psychology doctorate and receive no funding whatsoever.  There are a tiny number of places available.  Students are working on placement without pay.  There are extraordinary barriers that mean large numbers of people cannot get through the system.  When we have all these waiting lists and a mental health crisis that needs to be addressed, why is the Government not making it easy and supporting people who want to become psychologists in order to address the mental health crisis and waiting lists in this area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100019#R01200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1620745500,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I wish to deal with the issue of the policing reform implementation and whether it is the role of the Garda Commissioner to allocate the necessary resources.  One cannot have policing reform without some changes.  Obviously, the previous Government endorsed the report, A Policing Service for the Future, and an implementation group, which is chaired by Ms Helen Ryan, is dedicated to the implementation of the programme.  Associated with the report are ideas such as the sixth principle, which states, \"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be structured and managed to support front line policing.\"  Much of that is community policing.  I previously published a report on policing resource across the State, which I have updated for 2021.  There is no real evidence that there has been a change in the allocation of resources.  There are very big differences between some parts of the country.  Areas which are growing rapidly in population tend to be left behind, for example.  It is a big bone of contention for certain areas where many new developments are only a disadvantage in terms of public services.  Will the Taoiseach look at this issue and talk the Garda Commissioner?  To be honest, there will not be reform unless the resource allocations are also reformed.  I, too, speak in support of the Stardust families and the assistance they require for the inquests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100020#S00100","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1620745500,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I had intended to ask the Taoiseach about the fact that more than 50% of Covid-19 fines have been handed out to people between the ages of 18 and 24.

I will ask the Taoiseach about that matter another day, however,<\/p>  <p>  Last night, or more correctly, in the early hours of this morning, we saw workers lifted off picket lines outside the Debenhams store in Waterford.  They were physically removed from sitting positions by garda&iacute; in order to clear the way for trucks driven by non-union labour to remove disputed stock from the store.  The intervention of those garda&iacute; came after a five-hour stand-off between midnight and 5 a.m.  Members of the public order unit from Waterfront were there in big numbers, the area around the store was sealed off by garda&iacute; and traffic was diverted.  Some 40 garda&iacute; were involved in this operation.  In other words, more garda&iacute; were present than there were Debenhams workers and their supporters.  Those officers were backed up by six big police vans.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue here for the media to get its teeth into.

In fact, the role of garda&iacute; should be connected to dealing with crime and antisocial behaviour.  They should not be involved in industrial disputes full stop.  I will end this contribution with a statement.  As part of the policing reform being considered, the removal of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from involvement of the kind we saw last night in respect of industrial disputes should be on the agenda.

The Stardust fire was a most traumatic national tragedy that has left a terrible and particular legacy of pain for many people in north Dublin.  I greatly sympathise with all the families of the 48 young people who were tragically killed in that fire 40 years ago for the awful loss they suffered.  I also recognise the terrible impact it had on everyone who attended the Stardust that night.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice is absolutely committed to ensuring that all the families of the victims of the Stardust fire tragedy receive the supports they need in terms of legal aid at the new inquests.  Extensive work has already been undertaken towards this end.  Government funding of up to &euro;8 million has been allocated for the new inquests to cover a number of areas, including legal aid for the families.  The last remaining issue regarding legal aid for the families was the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, which made a set of amendments to the Coroners Act 1962 and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 that enabled legal aid at inquests in certain conditions.  Officials working for the Minister for Justice reviewed alternative arrangements for funding legal professionals, which were not considered to be the best option in terms of meeting the needs of the families compared to the facility provided by the Legal Aid Board.  Section 60 of the Coroners Act 1962, as amended, provides a procedure whereby a family member of the deceased may apply to the coroner for a request to be submitted to the board with regard to the granting of legal aid.  Applications for legal aid have been certified by the coroner and these applications are with the Legal Aid Board.<\/p>  <p>  Ordinarily, applicants through the legal aid system would pay an initial fee and support would be provided on the basis of a means test.  This is how the legal aid scheme works for all the individuals who seek its help and it is a widely respected system.  All of the Stardust families who meet the criteria of the Legal Aid Board, including the means test, will receive support.  The usual fee for legal aid applications has been waived and the legal professionals will receive refunds of their costs one month in arrears instead of after the inquests.  This goes beyond the provisions of the legislation in order to try to allay any concerns people may have.<\/p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board notified the Department of Justice that a very small number of the Stardust victims&rsquo; families would not qualify for legal aid because they exceed the income limits currently enforced by the Legal Aid Board, as required under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  The Minister for Justice has assured me that she is actively investigating the position and engaging with the Attorney General's office to explore possible mechanisms to provide for legal aid to those families who do not meet the financial eligibility requirements under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  This will require new arrangements to be put in place, such as new regulations.  This matter has been actively worked on since the issue was identified to ensure that an appropriate solution is found.  The Minister for Justice intends that the families and their legal professionals will have a response shortly and that the Stardust inquest should commence a few weeks after that.  I will engage with the Minister again after today's session to make sure that can be expedited.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in respect of policing reform and A Policing Service for the Future.  The Government's plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is a living document, which is reviewed and updated as required to maintain ambitious but realistic commitments, timeframes and milestones.  The policing reform implementation office, which is based in the Department of the Taoiseach, monitors progress and supports the work of the implementation group as well as keeping the high level steering board of policing reform and Government apprised of progress being made.<\/p>  <p>  The first two phases of A Policing Service for the Future, that is, the building-block phase of six months' duration and the launching phase of four to six months, have been completed and much has already been achieved, for example, the roll-out of a new operating model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na designed to streamline administration and provide a more visible response from localised policing service to communities nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a human rights unit and re-established the strategic human rights advisory committee.  The National Security Analysis Centre, NSAC, has been established and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2019 has been enacted, which gives garda&iacute; access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, for the first time and provides for a modern industrial relations framework within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  There has also been progress on legislative reform.  As Deputies will be aware, the Government recently published a general scheme of the landmark policing, security and community safety Bill.  I am not aware of the issues raised by Deputy Barry in terms of Waterford but I will have that checked out.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise Deputy Paul Murphy's issue of hot meals for the specific school in Killinarden with the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p> <p>Deputy Boyd Barrett raised, as he did last week, the issue of postgraduate psychological programmes and the costs associated.

Europe Day is a celebration of peace and unity in Europe.  It marks the birthday of what is today the European Union, the direct enabler of historic progress on this island and throughout Europe.  In the face of constant opposition from the extremes of the right and the left, the European Union has prevailed.  It has led to a dramatic improvement in living standards for every community.  It has protected democracy and spoken up for solidarity.  It has opposed the many extremist voices which continue to promote ideologies which offer nothing more than angry words and an ignorance of history.<\/p><p>It is a Union which Ireland joined freely 50 years ago with hopes and aspirations which have been met and exceeded time and again.  In a world where the arrogant, defensive and inward-looking nationalism of the past has tried to reassert itself, the European Union has stood for a positive vision.  It is a vision where sovereignty is enhanced by confident nations working together constructively and with strong rules to ensure fairness.<\/p><p>Like any entity built by people, it has its flaws and some of these are serious.  In any honest debate, however, we have to make time to acknowledge its overwhelmingly positive contributions.  We need to reaffirm our commitment to the core spirit of co-operation at its heart.  The idea of working to replace conflict with co-operation is as old as Europe itself.<\/p><p>History records many visionaries who looked at a Continent defined by warfare and called for a new approach.  In the 1920s and 1930s, one finds Irish leaders like &Eacute;amon de Valera and Se&aacute;n Lemass responding to rising tensions in Europe by calling for strong rules-based organisations.  De Valera's appeal to the League of Nations to respect limits of the actions of states remains one of the shining high points of Irish foreign policy and is one of the most prophetic predictions in the 1930s about where Europe might head.  Se&aacute;n Lemass, as a young man imprisoned after the Civil War, devoted himself to reading economic and political texts which might show a new road forward for Ireland.  His attraction to the idea of European economic co-operation began at that point.<\/p><p>So it was that the generation that fought for our independence continued to define our future as a positive and outward looking one, just as we find in the spirit of the 1916 Proclamation.  It remains the greatest tragedy of modern history that it took the disaster of the Second World War for Europe to turn to building strong rules-based co-operation.  Robert Schuman wished to see a Europe where war between European nations would become a thing of the past.<\/p><p>Much has happened over the past 70 years.  The European Union now comprises 27 member states from all parts of Europe, including many for whom membership of the Union has been central to overcoming the legacy of right-wing and left-wing totalitarian regimes.  While the European Union is by no means perfect, there are great advantages for a small, open, trading nation being at the centre of the European project.  Over the decades, we have shared many significant milestones and weathered many storms together.  There were good times like the reunification of Germany in 1990 or the addition of ten new member states under the Irish Presidency of the Council in 2004.  There have also been more difficult ones including the economic crisis, the departure of the United Kingdom and, of course, more recently the Covid-19 pandemic.  In good times and in bad, there has always been strength in unity.<\/p><p>I acknowledge in particular the role of the European Union in supporting the Good Friday Agreement and peace on this island.  The European Union has been an essential backdrop and forum where Irish and British Ministers and officials built the relationships which made possible the Anglo-Irish Agreement and later the Good Friday Agreement, as well as subsequent agreements.  Peace has been the most transformative change of all in Ireland over the past 20 years and more.  Throughout the peace process, the European Union has stood with us.<\/p><p>Our partners in the European institutions worked to protect peace and the Good Friday Agreement throughout the negotiations on Brexit.  They are working with us now as we seek to bed down the new arrangements.  This is the first Europe Day since the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was signed in December last year and ratified by the European Parliament last month.  We are now in the earliest days of a new European Union-United Kingdom dispensation.  It is clear that it will take time for the United Kingdom to become comfortable with its new relationship with the European Union and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p><p>At an early point in the Brexit negotiations, the United Kingdom decided to leave the Single Market and the customs union, even if it sometimes cavilled at what the inevitable consequences of this choice would be.  In choosing that path, the United Kingdom stepped outside the seamless trading environment of the European Union.  Being outside means friction.  While this is an obstacle to trade, it should not be one to partnership.  It is a time now to rebuild trust, which has become a scarcer commodity following more than four years of negotiation and upheaval.<\/p><p>As we in Ireland know from all our key relationships, whether as a member of the UN Security Council currently, as a EU member state or as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, trust is the very stuff of peace, prosperity, partnership and success.  That is also why Ireland has chosen our own path.  It is the path of the European Union, where countries play by the same rules, co-operate freely and fairly and try to raise all boats.  Never did our choice resonate more than it did over those four and a half years as the European Union and United Kingdom negotiated the UK's withdrawal agreement and then the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  At times, there were difficult days during these negotiations.  Amidst all of the uncertainty caused by Brexit, one unequivocal certainty came to the fore, namely, the certain value of the solidarity that comes from being a member state of the European Union.<\/p><p>Over the past year, Covid-19 has challenged us all and tested our resolve.  Governments in the European Union and beyond have been faced with difficult choices as they sought to protect life and health, while also limiting the damage to jobs, enterprise and economies.  The European Union's institutions were also faced with a crisis and a challenge of immense scale in an area where the Union's competence and ability to respond were constrained.<\/p><p>Despite this, the European Union has played a pivotal role in our collective response to the pandemic.  The European Commission has supported vaccine development and procurement.  We can clearly see those benefits now.  Approximately 200 million doses of safe and effective vaccines have already been distributed inside the European Union, not much more than a year since the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic.  A further 200 million vaccines have been exported from the European Union to 90 other countries.  This makes the European Union the foremost bloc in the production and distribution of vaccines in the entire world, a point which does not get the commentary it deserves and gets undermined in domestic commentary here.  This is a remarkable achievement by the European Union in itself.<\/p><p>The Commission's work on vaccines is a clear example of the EU responding to its citizens' needs and supporting member states' efforts to combat the pandemic.  As I noted, large quantities of vaccines produced in the EU have been exported to over 90 countries across the world.<\/p> <p>However, we acknowledge we must do more to support global solidarity.  The European Union will continue its efforts to contribute to the international response to the pandemic, including through the COVAX facility, and we must continue to ensure nobody is left behind.  The European Union launched its Team Europe initiative in April last year and has so far mobilised a budget of over &euro;40 billion of resources from the European Union, its member states and financial institutions.  Ireland will play its part.  We responded rapidly in recent weeks to provide life saving equipment to India in response to the worsening Covid-19 outbreak there.  This support is part of the coordinated effort by the European Union member states, through the European Civil Protection Mechanism.<\/p> <p> It is clear Covid-19 will leave deep and lasting economic and social impacts.  Last year, the European Union, its institutions and its member states came together in a way that has demonstrated to its citizens the strength there is in unity.  The &euro;1.8 trillion budgetary package agreed by the European Council last July &ndash; my own first meeting as Taoiseach - represents a new and important milestone in European Union solidarity.  The spectre of the pandemic was to the forefront of all our minds as we worked over the course of four long days and nights to address the gravity of this unprecedented collective challenge.  Despite sometimes very difficult negotiations, we agreed a fair, balanced and ambitious package to support Europe&rsquo;s economic recovery and to drive the climate and digital transformation on which our future well-being and prosperity rely.  This includes a targeted and front-loaded investment, through the recovery and resilience facility, and reinforcement of key MMF programmes.  Importantly, the recovery package sent a message that in the most testing of times, even when there are differing views as to the right approach and the best way forward, European Union leaders can work together and find a compromise that delivers for our citizens.  In the middle of possibly the greatest challenge our Union has faced, there probably could not have been a better outcome.<\/p> <p> Over the next seven years we will contribute more to the EU budget than we will receive and in doing so we will extend the same solidarity to others that we have benefited from over many decades.  We do this because this is a model that works.  The path to full economic recovery will be very challenging and we will need to use all of the tools available to us.  Among the most important of these is the Single Market.  We will need to harness its full potential to drive the digital and climate transformations on which our future prosperity depends.  In building the Single Market of the future, economic openness remains crucial.  The European Union should continue to work and advocate for strong, open, rules-based, multilateralism as a framework within which we can advance our interests and defend our values.  In that respect, recent work in respect of the value of trade deals, under the aegis of the European Union, revealed very significant benefits for small to medium-sized enterprises in Ireland and indeed for the multinational presence in Ireland.  Therefore, the House, and those who are opposed to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and other trade deals need really to reappraise that opposition because the evidence about the Canada deal and also the Japan deal, South Korea deal and other trade deals is quite significant in terms of the value to GDP and also the value added to Irish companies which create jobs here and produce products and solutions for the global market and help to solve many problems across the globe.<\/p> <p> As I said, the European Union is more than just a shared marketplace.  The Porto Declaration, signed by European Union leaders this weekend, makes clear that our shared European ideal is first and foremost about improving the lives of our citizens.  It marks an important milestone in setting a progressive EU agenda for the decade ahead.  I joined European Union leaders at the social summit at the invitation of the Portuguese Presidency to reinforce our collective national and European Union-level commitment to implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights.  The concrete employment, skills and poverty-reduction targets to be achieved by 2030 are an exemplar of the practical focus I believe is necessary in setting the strategic direction for the period ahead.  These European Union targets are for an adult employment rate of 78%, 60% of adults to be in training annually and a reduction of at least 15 million in the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, including at least 5 million children.  They provide the right political emphasis for the European Union and member states in steering the European semester process of economic governance for annual budgets, including this year&rsquo;s national recovery and resilience plans.  It is very welcome that the social pillar will continue to provide a clear political compass for our collective actions in responding effectively to 21st century challenges and opportunities and equipping our citizens with the skills and capabilities for full economic and social participation.<\/p> <p> There are other important challenges that can only be faced by working together with others.  Last December, European Union leaders took the opportunity to reinforce Europe&rsquo;s leadership role on climate.  As we reached the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, the European Union stepped-up its ambition level and committed to an increase in the EU 2030 target to at least 55% emissions reduction.  We also agreed to raise our climate ambition in a manner that will drive sustainable economic growth, create jobs, deliver health and environmental benefits for European Union citizens and contribute to the long-term global competitiveness of the European Union economy.  The European Union green deal is at the forefront of European Union priorities and we collectively grapple with the challenge of transforming our economies and societies in the years ahead.  Later this month, the European Council will continue its discussion on climate and over the summer the Commission will present its Fit for 55 suite of measures to drive implementation of our target.<\/p> <p> We must also work together on the twin challenge of progressing the digital transition.  The Digital Compass proposals presented by the European Commission in March are a further important contribution in this regard.  They include clear ambitions for digital skills, data and connectivity infrastructure and for increasing the digital intensity of business and our public services.  In March, European Union leaders set important political orientations for the ambitious legislative agenda being advanced by the Commission on digital issues, which are becoming fundamental to the dynamism of the Single Market.  An open, well-functioning, competitive and innovative digital economy is clearly the essential basis for the European Union&rsquo;s future economic strength.  It is important we continue to strike the right balance here, shaping Europe&rsquo;s future in a direction that remains open, competitive and innovation-friendly while strengthening the European Union&rsquo;s commitments to rules-based multilateralism.<\/p> <p> We must also acknowledge the role the European Union plays on the world stage.  The US President, Mr. Biden, recently joined European leaders by video conference.  The European Union and the United States will not agree on everything but no serious progress on global challenges is possible without strong EU-US cooperation.  Ireland&rsquo;s ambition is for the European Union to become an ever-stronger advocate and actor in support of resilient, open, rules-based political and economic multilateralism.  This is the most effective and indeed only effective way to advance our interests and to defend our values.  This pandemic has shown, in very sharp relief, just how interlinked the world is.  No country can stand aside and ignore the global context for social and economic inequality, organised misinformation, the erosion of core values and the existential issues of climate change and the biodiversity crisis.  We must do more than recognise these issues.  We must contribute actively to global, international and regional alliances and initiatives to tackle and to counter them.  That is why Ireland puts such store in our international engagement, through the European Union and United Nations in particular.<\/p> <p> On Sunday the Conference on the Future of Europe was formally launched in Strasbourg.  I welcome the conference as a practical way of boosting citizen engagement with the European Union.  The peace and prosperity brought by this unique political project has undoubtedly improved the lives of all Europeans.  In securing this peace and prosperity for the 21st century and building together our bridge to a brighter future, this is the right time for a stronger citizen-focused dialogue that can reinvigorate our democracies, give new voice to the priorities of our families and communities and begin a deeper engagement with the collective intelligence of our villages, towns, cities and regions.  The joint declaration signed in March by the European Parliament President, David Sassoli, the Prime Minister of Portugal, Ant&oacute;nio Costa, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council and Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, paves the way to a series of debates and discussions that will enable people from every corner of the Continent to share their ideas on shaping Europe&rsquo;s future.  Our own national launch event will take place this Friday, 14 May led by the Minister of State with responsibility for EU Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and I look forward to constructive and considered Oireachtas support for this important initiative. <\/p> <p>As we mark Europe Day, let us recall that Ireland will be an advocate for a strong and effective European Union, defined by democracy, the rule of law and solidarity.  We will actively engage bilaterally and through international organisations to support open and fair trade, combat disinformation, protect democracies and promote understanding.  Whether we are acting globally or locally, there are many challenges best faced in solidarity and co-operation with European partners.<\/p> <p> Mar a deir an seanfhocal, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile agus is &eacute; sin cro&iacute;l&aacute;r chl&aacute;r an Aontais Eorpaigh.

The global pandemic has given us pause to think about the world in which we live.  In these days of loss and uncertainty, people have demonstrated a remarkable resilience to weather the present and to look to the future with ambition.  As we continue the fight against Covid-19, the prospect of getting our lives back fills our hearts with immense hope.<\/p><p>This is not a hope born of a desire to return to normal or to life as it was before the pandemic.  This has been a period of enormous social trauma but it has also been a period of a great collective soul-searching across society.  People have found a fierce appetite for something far better than what had gone before.  This is a future shaped by true European values of solidarity, equality, human dignity and democracy.  We saw this desire in how Germans sang &quot;Bella Ciao&quot;, the Italian resistance song, in support of the beleaguered Italian people; in how Spaniards clapped health workers on their way into work <i>cada noche<\/i>, every night; and in how households in Ireland put candles in the window to honour all those who have tragically lost their lives.<\/p><p>The peoples of Europe have turned not to individualism, not to private interests but rather full-face to the public good.  They recognise that strong public services and a fair economy are essential.  There is a lesson in this outpouring of human solidarity and there is inspiration there too, a guide for the road that Europe must now travel.  As the desire for fairer societies grows stronger, the European Union cannot simply remain tethered to the past.  Seven decades on from the Schuman Declaration, we have an opportunity to reimagine what the European Union can be.  We have a chance to respond to citizens' ambition for a better future. <font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Too often the EU has promoted austerity and privatisation, which is an economic model that has failed.  Too often the EU has facilitated the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, from the many to the few.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The Conference on the Future of Europe was launched on Sunday to engage with citizens on how the EU should deal with the challenges facing it, and it is very welcome.  The truth is we cannot have more of the same.  We must learn from Brexit that many people feel deeply disempowered.  This is not all the fault of the EU.  Governments often blame the EU for their own policy choices and failures.  When the EU promotes the economic model that favours the well-off at the expense of ordinary people, the elites at the expense of citizens, there should be no surprise that people will reject it.  This is the discussion we need to have.<\/font>The <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">European Union must become a vehicle for social progress for the many rather than a vehicle for the enrichment of the few.<\/font><\/p><p>We can construct a social Europe in a way in which citizens and member states have a greater say in formulating positive policy positions within the Union.  This would be a social Europe of equals, partnership and solidarity, guided by democratic principles and based on the premise that it is by states working together as equals on matters of mutual interest that we can best serve citizens of the EU.  I believe that European Union can be a force for good.  It can be a champion of peace and human rights all around the world, nowhere less than in the Middle East where the people of Palestine again desperately cry out for international protection and justice.<\/p><p>Right now being a force for good means the EU supporting the intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines because we are a global community and the fight against this virus is global.  We have a humanitarian duty to ensure all the peoples of the world have access to the vaccines they need.  This is not only a humane approach but one based on enlightened self and mutual interest.<\/p><p>A progressive Europe must also be to the fore in responding to climate change and in shaping a transition that is truly just.  It must lead advancements in workers and union rights.  Europe should be a refuge for those in need of help and shelter, not a privileged fortress cut from plight and suffering.  A modern Europe should look not to militarisation or federalism but to progress in solving the common challenges of humanity.  This is about education for all, housing for all, healthcare for all and prosperity for all.  These principles are crucial as Ireland and the EU face the future together.<\/p><p>As the world changes and as soul-search together to chart a new course, the parallel journeys to a new Europe and a new and united Ireland are powerfully complementary.  Irish unity is the very best idea for the future of our island.  It is a destination shaped by currents of change that shape lives and history.  The pandemic and Brexit have utterly transformed the conversation and debate on Irish reunification.  A new and united Ireland within a new social Europe is now a real prospect.  Citizens recognise that it makes sense for Ireland in its entirety to be part of the same trading bloc and the same Single Market with the four freedoms that ensue.  To be a part of Europe - that is what the people of the North want and that is what the people of the South want.  To stand still or tread water is no longer an option for leaders in Ireland or Europe.  Change is coming and there will be a referendum on Irish unity so the people will have their say.  It is all of our jobs to prepare for that and to make the transition to a united Ireland a success for all the people who share this island.  Just as with the support for the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and the securing of the protocol, the EU will have a central role in this.<\/p><p>We are not a nation of little islanders.  Ireland&rsquo;s place, North and South, is within a Europe of equals.  We will look again, as we have before, to our gallant allies in Europe to continue positively engaging with the process of Irish reunification as we transform our society.  We will look to them as we build the all-island economy, all-island public services and an all-island society that is home to all, regardless of background or identity.<\/p> <p>Unity will be the watershed moment in the history of Ireland and a moment we must seize.  Just as both Governments should prepare for unity, the European Union must also prepare for the day that Ireland, in our totality, joins as a united nation.  There is no doubt in my mind that a united Ireland would form part of a positive and progressive reshaping of the European dynamic.<\/p> <p> In the words of Bob Dylan, the \"old road is rapidly aging.&rdquo;  The old order is being exposed like never before.  We have an opportunity to recast Ireland and Europe on the foundations of equality, hope and economic justice.  The future will either be reactionary or revolutionary.  Now is the time to confidently step forward with big and ambitious ideas to build a better Europe and a better Ireland.  In order to achieve change we have to reach out to people who do not feel represented.  From the smallest village to the largest cities, we need to address the real social and economic challenges.  We need to empower people and communities and encourage them to take the future into their own hands.  We need to give them power to shape the society in which they live.<\/p> <p> This is a good vision for how to shape Europe and Ireland in the years that lie ahead.  The future of Europe and Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Europe will be shaped by the decisions we make today.  Let us not cling timidly to the past.  Let us boldly move forward in partnership, common purpose and common cause.  Let us move forward in hope to refound a Europe of social solidarity and a new united Ireland for all of our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100023#V00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620747900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity for a short few minutes to speak on the issue of Europe Day.  Europe, the political and economic vision of close co-operation and significant integration, has been the major post-Second World War project for most European democracies.  Through the steps of the European Common Market and the European Economic Community, EEC, we have achieved a European Union founded on the shared values of tolerance, equality and peace on our Continent.  We have a way to go, however.<\/p>  <p>  The expansion of our Union has often been based on political pragmatism.  We had the accession of Spain post Franco, Portugal post Salazar and Greece post the colonels.  This did not happen because the democratic values in those countries had reached such levels that they could instantly involve themselves in the institutions of the European Union but to bed down democracy.  That has been one of the driving forces of the European Union since the Second World War.  That is hugely important in ensuring a democratic base in Europe.  Even in our lifetime, we have seen in the Balkans what the absence of bedding down that fundamental democracy can mean.  That has been significantly undervalued and insufficiently recognised.<\/p>  <p>  The underpinning principles of the European Union are human rights and economic cohesion.  I want to say a word about each of those.  Human rights are based on equality.  The concept of equality on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race and religion is fundamental.  We still have a way to go, even within the European Union, to ensure those values are defended and exported.  On economic cohesion, a basic principle was to bring the economic well-being of all of our citizens up to the highest levels.  We established the Cohesion Fund for that very purpose, and Ireland has benefited from that fund.<\/p>  <p>  I sometimes listen to commentary about the European Union exporting austerity or being a conservative economic force.  In truth, the European Union is what the people of Europe elect it to be.  When the European Union had socialists and democrats in dominant positions, at the time of Jacques Delors and others such as Romano Prodi, there was a different vision.  At times of crisis, such as during our economic crisis, for example, the dominant political forces have, unfortunately, been conservative, primarily the European People's Party, EPP.  That is the reason that conservative approach exists.  The European institutions themselves do not have a political flavour.  They are determined by whomsoever is elected to government in the member states of the Union.  If we want progressive politics, we must elect progressive politicians to achieve that objective.<\/p>  <p>  I will make brief mention of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which is often criticised.  It was created by Sicco Mansholt, a Dutch farmer who remembered the two post-Second World War famines in his country of the Netherlands.  He designed an agricultural strategy for Europe to obliterate hunger, which in and of itself is not a mean or poor objective to have for someone who had experienced the famine that ravaged his country in the winter of 1945-46.  To ensure that Europe would never go hungry again was a desirable and noble objective.<\/p>  <p>  We must be clear on what Ireland wants or expects of the European Union.  Many, including many Members of this House, measure our involvement in a purely transactional term.  They ask how much we put in and how much we get back.  Brexit is our wake-up call.  If we see the European Union as something separate from us, as being over there in Brussels and a place to go for funding or for access to markets or goods, whether it is vaccines or something else, then we miss the fundamental point of Europe.  The point of Europe is to build a different concept and politics to ensure peace, prosperity and cohesion, the rule of law and fundamental equality.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has to help create the European Union.  We have done our job to date in all its flaws and complexities.  It is a place of democratic stability, rule of law, equality and economic opportunity but we have an awful lot further to go to achieve the objective that each of us can envisage for our Continent as the best possible place to live for our peoples in the future.  We have to do it outside the shadow of Britain and be willing to contribute in every sense to make that noble vision a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100024#W00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1620747900,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the fact that today, 11 May, is the 50th anniversary of the death of my grandfather, former Taoiseach Se&aacute;n Lemass.  He was a man who did so much to open up this country and lay the groundwork for accession to the EEC in 1973, as the Taoiseach stated.  In that way, it is entirely appropriate that we are having this debate today.<\/p>  <p>  I note that there was a European Council meeting in Portugal last weekend.  Under discussion were EU social policies in a post-Covid world.  The Council pledged, among other things, that 78% of citizens will be in employment by 2030, 15 million people will be lifted out of poverty and 60% of workers will get training and upskilling every year.  This is the EU at its best, a social Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the statement issued by President Higgins for Europe Day 2021, along with other European Heads of State.<\/p> <p>The President referred to the need to reflect on the core multilateral values of the EU institutions and is of the view that the EU should not be seen purely in economic and monetary terms.  The EU is not just an economic union, although the Single Market is very important for Irish businesses.  The EU has been transformative for Ireland.  It has been a force for progressive social and cultural change.  It has been responsible for dragging Ireland kicking and screaming initially into the 20th century and now into the 21st century.  So many areas of Irish life have been transformed as a result of our membership of the EU, including labour law and the rights of workers, environmental laws, our commitment to tackle climate change and consumer legislation to name but a few.  However, there is no room for complacency.  The EU is not perfect and there is always room for reform of its institutions.<\/p> <p> The economic and financial crash of 2008 and the consequent austerity measures resulted in high unemployment levels, particularly among young people.  Inequality became more pronounced.  The EU was seen to be imposing these unpopular measures and social cohesion was threatened.  Hence the need to ensure the EU should never be a force for the implementation of neoliberal economic policies.  The EU is much more than this.  It needs to be responsive to the needs and aspirations of all its citizens and liberal democratic values are at its core.<\/p> <p> Brexit was a wake up call for us all.  Populism and intolerance will flourish when the system is not working.  This brings me to rule of law issues and problems in Hungary and Poland in particular.  Adherence to democratic values is central to membership of the EU, including fundamental rights, media freedom, free and fair elections, judicial independence and ethics in politics.  These values are central to the EU and there can be no backsliding in enforcing these values in member states where it is necessary and by whatever means possible.  In particular, the establishment of LGBTI+ zones in Poland is unacceptable and needs to be called out by the EU.<\/p> <p> As we know, the Conference on the Future of Europe has been launched.  This should cover a wide range of issues, including building a healthy continent post-Brexit, the fight against climate change and environmental challenges, an economy that works for people, social fairness, equality and intergenerational solidarity, Europe's digital transformation and European rights and values, including the rule of law, migration challenges, security, the EU's role in the world, the Union's democratic foundations and how to strengthen democratic processes governing the European Union.  These have been outlined by the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne.  The range of issues is wide.<\/p> <p> The consultation in this country needs to be genuine and engaging and reach as many people as possible, particularly the young.  For my part, I do not see any real need for treaty change.  I believe the existing treaties have not been fully utilised to deal with the ongoing challenges we face including, for example, public health, of which we are all very much aware during the pandemic.  I also believe that we need to ensure the protection of the treaty-guaranteed right to set our own tax rates during this consultation process and when it comes to a conclusion.<\/p> <p> Ireland's policy of military neutrality in no way means that we lack solidarity with the EU.  Ireland strongly supports international co-operation in ensuring peace and stability in the world and in promoting peace and justice and basic human rights, and we do this through the United Nations and through selected permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, operations among other things.<\/p> <p> In December, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs published a report on the Conference on the Future of Europe which contains a number of recommendations.  The main recommendation is that national parliaments need to be very much involved and that we need to find new ways to engage with the citizens in this country, to reach out to them and not just reach out to the usual interest groups and social partners and see whether we can get a really meaningful debate under way.  I hope the Government will look at the committee's recommendations as we set about launching the consultation process in this country this week.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the launch by the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, of the EU careers strategy.  We need to increase Irish representation in the EU institutions and agencies as we face the so-called demographic cliff with the imminent retirement of Irish senior officials.  It is an excellent initiative brought forward by the Minister of State and I hope it will reach young people, in particular our graduates and masters students, so they consider a career in the European Union institutions.<\/p> <p> As we speak, the EU recovery and resilience fund of &euro;750 billion is under discussion, as is the Brexit adjustment reserve of &euro;5 billion.  The House could do with an update on where Ireland stands in the context of these funds at present.  Have our plans been submitted?  When will the process with regard to these two funds be concluded?<\/p> <p> Ireland and Irish citizens continue to show support for the EU.  A poll undertaken recently by European Movement Ireland showed that 84% agreed that Ireland should remain part of the EU.  This is a significant figure and is at the top of support for the EU among member states.  The poll undertaken for European Movement Ireland is well worth studying.  It includes many percentages on Europe, the European Union and where we should go.  No doubt it will be part of the consultation process on the future of Europe.<\/p> <p> We need to see the full implementation of the trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK and the Northern Ireland protocol and make them work.  Ireland experienced extraordinary solidarity from our EU partners during the Brexit process in the formulation of the trade and co-operation agreement and, more particularly, in the formulation of the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is unfinished work and we need to see both of these implemented and carefully scrutinised in the coming months and years.<\/p> <p> It is important that we get the Conference on the Future of Europe up and running in this country and finalise our conclusions so we can plan for the Europe ahead.  Europe has brought peace, prosperity and progress to this country, and to Europe as a whole, and this should never be forgotten.  It has been the most successful peace process in the history of mankind and this is something we should never take for granted.<\/p> <p> The admission of new member states should also be under active consideration.  The Taoiseach noted that in 2004 we admitted ten additional member states.  It is not a time to pull up the ladder.  It is not a time to say we are all right now, everything is grand and we will keep everybody out.  We need to be magnanimous and the admission of new nation states, particularly from the Balkans region, would enhance Europe and improve security.

The Europe that emerged out of this search to achieve a peaceful coexistence has allowed the formerly belligerent nations of western Europe to not only coexist, but to prosper in a spirit of mutual dependency.  With such success and prosperity comes responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  However, Europeans have differing views as to how this should be allowed manifest itself.  Among those at the helm of the political leadership of the EU, there are those who believe that the EU must develop a degree of military muscle and that the EU needs to develop its own independent military capacity.  Some suggest that there are already plans in place to send EU forces into Mozambique by the end of this year to protect French mining interests in a gas-rich province.  The irony of sending European troops back to what was a former Portuguese colony to preserve European interests is apparently lost on Europe's politicians.<\/p>  <p>  There are those, too, who believe it more incumbent on the European Union to focus on the development of moral muscle.  I do not believe that there is any other issue where this absence of moral intent is felt more keenly than on the issue of the plight of the Palestinian people.  The International Criminal Court has recently opened an investigation into Israel for war crimes and last week, Human Rights Watch, a reputable and respected international organisation, laid the accusation of gross human rights abuse, that is, the policy of apartheid, at the feet of the Israeli state.  The various responses we have witnessed tell their own tale.  The EU offered a salutary response possessed of worthy sentiment but little of tangible consequences for Israel for continuing with its abhorrent policy.  The Government decided to sit on its hands again and prevaricate, hiding behind Government attempts at deciphering the legal meaning of the word \"apartheid\".  One could argue that there is little time for such niceties when an Israeli army bulldozer is bearing down on one's family home threatening all that one holds dear.  Then we have the Israeli response: an arrogant dismissal; followed by an assault on the third holiest site within the religion of Islam, leading to the injury of and assault on hundreds of Palestinians; and an assault on Gaza, with two dozen deaths, including nine children.  The EU was quick to impose sanctions on Russia for its actions in Crimea.  The time for the Government to sit on its hands is over.  It is not a time for words.  It is a time for action.  At the very least, we need to see the same array of sanctions that were put on Russia being put on the table in this instance, such as the censoring of diplomatic relations, the freezing of assets and travel for individuals directly implicated in illegal Israeli practices, the potential restructuring of EU&ndash;Israeli relations; and a restriction of economic co-operation such as would impact on the Horizon Europe 2021-2027 programme.<\/p>  <p>  These are only some of the many actions and options open to both the Government and the EU.  Concurrent to this, we need to see the Government take this issue to the UN Security Council as a matter of urgency.  We need to call for an emergency session and for the public implementation of all the UN resolutions on Jerusalem and occupied Palestine.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical to note that the Palestinian people are a people marked for complete erasure.  The Israeli Government wishes to force them off their land to reduce their existence to disparate groups struggling to survive on a few dozen Bantustans, removing the potential for a two-state solution and condemning what will be left of the Palestinian people to the perpetual state of refugee in what is legally their own country.<\/p>  <p>  The time for the Government to act is now.  We do not need more meaningless words.  We need action, and action now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100026#Y00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1620749100,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Europe Day is a day celebrating peace and unity.  I echo that - a day celebrating peace and unity - given all that is going on in the world, all that we have seen on television screens and all that has been experienced by the people of Palestine, not only over the past 24 hours or the past week, but for many decades.  We should be cognisant of talking about how we celebrate a day of peace and unity while 27 people were killed last night, including nine children, but I will talk about Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Europe is often talked about as a peace project.  In many ways, it has been a very successful peace project.  I am somebody who considers himself, in addition to being a proud Dub and a proud Irish person, a proud European.  I believe that Europe, on the whole, has been good for Ireland.  When we joined in 1973, Ireland was a predominantly agrarian society more connected to the 19th century than to the 20th century.  From 1973 onwards, we accelerated ourselves more into the 21st century and left many of our neighbours and contemporaries in Europe far behind in terms of the type of society that we have created here that is modern, forward-thinking, progressive and outward-looking.<\/p>  <p>  There have been stand-out moments in our relationship with the European Union, the most important of which, for me and for all of us here who value our peace on this island, was the support and solidarity that was given to the Irish people throughout the lead up to the Good Friday Agreement.  That will live long in memory.  While that peace is still very much a process, the somewhat stability we have on this island is a recognition of that contribution.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the past 24 months of Ireland's pathway toward and engagement in the withdrawal negotiations as Britain sought to leave the European Union, there is an old saying in international diplomacy that the strong do what they will while the weak suffer what they must.  It is fair to say that during the withdrawal negotiations, Ireland's position certainly was not weak.  We were able to stare our neighbours in the eye confidently and, I would argue, more strongly and that was due to our relationship with the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated that European is not perfect.  It is far from perfect.  The rate in the European Union of those at risk of poverty or social exclusion stands at 21%.  Poverty is the greatest threat to the European Union.  When I walk along where we are at present in the heart of what was once - and still is to some degree but not the same way as I remember it - Dublin's docklands, I think about when I used travel with my family on holidays to Pwllheli where we would often go through Holyhead.  I often take the ferry and head over to Holyhead.  Holyhead is a place that I have lots of great memories of.  It was only in later years I learnt that Holyhead and the province of Anglesey where it is located is statistically the poorest part of the United Kingdom.  Twenty-two per cent of the children born in Anglesey and Holyhead are at risk of or in poverty.  The people of Holyhead chose to vote in favour of Brexit.  Despite the fact that they were entirely dependent upon trade and exports for their livelihoods, they still chose Brexit and a shot into the unknown because of a European Union which had moved towards economic principles that were, they felt, and many would agree, strongly against their interests.  A shot in the dark was better than the reality of what they were experiencing.<\/p>  <p>  Poverty is the greatest threat to the European Union.  The European Union has too often turned its back on the real-life experiences of those who have resided within its borders.  A fruit of that poison orchard for me is what is seen in the rise of the far right.  People manipulating communities who have been to the fore of collectivism and telling them that other people were the cause of their ills while being backed up by powerful forces within the European Union is a poison fruit of that orchard.  I utterly refuse, however, to accept that the same communities, which are always to the forefront of embracing collectivism, which have been the ones who were the first in terms of accepting diversity and welcoming in people from foreign shores, be they fleeing persecution or simply looking to build a better life for themselves or their families, are the ones who have been advancing this hatred within the European Union; far from it.<\/p> <p>It is people in positions of power and influence such as Viktor Orb&aacute;n in Hungary or those in Poland whose far-right principles have been accommodated, to some degree, in terms of their denigration of LGBT+ communities and their efforts to lobby to remove gender equality from EU statements.  We must condemn and confront the far right, wherever it may be, whether on the streets or in the European Parliament.  <\/p> <p> I echo the sentiment already expressed that while Europe Day is a day celebrating peace and unity, there can be absolutely no peace and unity if the EU refuses to take a position of strength in calling what is happening in Israel, Jerusalem and the occupied territories exactly what it is, which is an annexation.  It needs to be called that; otherwise the EU's claim to be a Union built on peace and unity is a fraud.  We cannot put a fortress around our own peace and unity and commend ourselves on 9 May every year while people in the occupied territories in Palestine are being bombed.  The median age of the population in the Gaza Strip is 17 years and seven months.  When the Government of Israel chooses to drop bombs on the Gaza Strip, it is willingly killing children.  If the European Union, and Ireland as a member state, are not willing to call that out and stand against that injustice in the strongest possible terms, then the very purpose of the Union is rendered obsolete.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach to take the strongest line on this and to call this annexation for what it is.  Ireland must use its power, position and influence to condemn, in the fullest terms, the Government of Israel for its treatment of the Palestinian people.  We must say \"No more\", draw a line in the sand and demonstrate fortitude on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100026#Y00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620749700,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I have always considered myself a European.  From early on, it was part of my self-definition.  I was an Irish citizen first and foremost and within that, there are local and tribal loyalties like the address lines on an envelope marking townland, parish, county but in the wider frame, I am a European, a member of the European Economic Community as it was and, now, of the European Union.  I have been a beneficiary of the four freedoms in a Europe without borders, particularly the right of free movement of people.  I have worked in Germany and Italy without hindrance or impediment.  Indeed, I was in Italy for the changeover to the euro in 2002.  In Ireland, we had cashed in our punts by the end of the first week in January whereas the Italians clung to their beloved lira right up to the six-week deadline, a small anecdotal measure of the high regard we have for the European project in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We are one of the most pro-EU member states, according to Eurobarometer polling.  We have seen and felt the improvements in our own country derived from our membership of the EU, socially, economically and environmentally.  It is to our shame that progress in this country on social and environmental issues has often come at the insistence of Europe rather than through leadership on our own part from this House.  I refer, for example, to the water framework directive and the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which is among the most important and robust EU legislation in the last decade.  <\/p>  <p>  We have also known peace here in our own country and across the EU and have experienced a period of relative stability, free from warfare.  Europe had torn itself asunder for centuries and the European project emerged from the smouldering ruins of a continent that self-immolated through two world wars of almost unthinkable savagery.  I am sure Robert Schuman has been much quoted already today.  He was a pragmatic dreamer who understood that there can be power in the prosaic.  He argued that Europe would be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.  In 1998, John Hume acknowledged the European Union as \"the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution\".  He argued that the peoples of Europe \"had created institutions which respected their diversity ... but allowed them to work together in their common and substantial economic interest.  They spilt their sweat and not their blood and by doing so broke down the barriers of distrust of centuries and the new Europe has evolved and is still evolving , based on agreement and respect for difference\".  Both men knew that the European Union was not an inevitability but a conscious and creative act of the imagination, rooted in the practical and pragmatic pursuit of a shared common good underpinned by respect and a tolerance for our differences.  We are both the same and different and it is in our diversity and solidarity that we are strong.  However, our union is not inevitable and I wonder if we are forgetting that through long habituation.  In Hungary we see sustained pressure on democratic institutions, civil society and the rule of law, while in Poland there has been a crackdown on LGBTQI+ rights, attacks on independent media and a near total ban on access to abortion in January of this year.  Our closest neighbour, with which we have the longest and deepest cultural ties, has chosen to leave the European Union.  Much of the debate in the referendum and the subsequent fallout was tinged with nationalist rhetoric and a focus on borders.  <\/p>  <p>  To my mind, the European project is as essential today as ever and we must re-engage in a conscious way with that continuous and creative process of making and remaking our shared European identity.  If the European Union has been a force to the good for human rights and workers' rights within our borders, which it has been in the main, then let us fiercely defend those advancements and seek to project them beyond our borders.  In our trade agreements with others, let us insist on due diligence when it comes to human rights and insist that the intrinsic dignity of the person is preserved in the supply chains of those products we allow into our markets.  Let us vindicate the UN's sustainable development goals here in Europe and work in partnership with governments in the developing world to help them do the same.  In the immediate term and in the teeth of this pandemic, let us use every lever, including the sharing of materials, manufacturing knowledge and intellectual property, to accelerate the global vaccine roll-out and safeguard us all from the prospect of vaccine escape.  Let us face up to our shared responsibility as one of the most developed parts of the globe to deal with the existential threat of biodiversity and climate breakdown.  The European Union, and Ireland as a member state, must achieve and exceed its climate ambitions and, in doing so, support a just transition to a climate neutral economy in Europe and further afield.  This can and should be the practical and pragmatic project that binds us as a union to the common good for another 70 years and more.  Let us continue to invest in that collective act of the imagination that allows me to call myself a European citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100027#Z00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1620749700,"counter":213,"content":"<p>My experiences of Europe Day have been a bit strange.  I must admit that before I was an MEP, I did not even know that such a thing existed.  When I was in the European Parliament I often found it bizarre that European institutions treated the day as if it was being marked on every street corner and in every community centre in each member state.  MEPs would gather in Strasbourg where the EU flag was flown everywhere, including a massive one unfurled at the centre of the Hemicycle and Beethoven's Ode to Joy, which somebody decided was the EU's anthem, would blare out across the sound system before speakers from each institution would rise and decry nationalism.  It was a surreal experience that was far removed from the reality of the citizens across member states who, on that day, were simply getting on with their lives.  Many were struggling and I suspect, like the pre-MEP me, the majority were unaware that it was a day that the great and good expected them to mark.  That experience was a good reflection of the European institutions which all too often are far removed from the communities, workers and families affected by their decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union has delivered much that should be celebrated.  It has established universal rights and embedded peace among its members.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has created an open market that has sustained many farming communities in Ireland and across Europe.  <\/p> <p>The cohesion policy has diverted infrastructure resources to regions that were long neglected by national governments.  The role the EU played in supporting the Irish peace process is something we are all grateful for.<\/p> <p> The people of Ireland want to be part of the European Union.  We saw that most recently in the Six Counties when a majority voted to remain part of the European Union against a Brexiteer agenda that was led by the right and the Tories in Britain.  In recognising the Irish people&rsquo;s wish to be part of the European Union, it is important to also recognise some of the deeply worrying flaws and moves the European Union is currently taking.  Just last week, Members of the European Parliament voted to endorse &euro;7.9 billion as part of the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, going towards a so-called European defence fund.  In reality, that fund is a massive subsidy taken from the peoples of Europe to go to the European arms industry.  I am not sure any ordinary citizen in Europe believes that is the correct way to spend money.<\/p> <p> At the end of the next MFF, we in this country will contribute an additional &euro;1 billion per annum to the European Union budget but we will get less back in the most important EU programmes, those that made the Union popular in the first place.  There will be less money coming back to Ireland in the Common Agricultural Policy and very little money coming back in cohesion funding.  Instead, every single line in the EU budget is facilitating and creating the wherewithal for the EU arms industry to draw down even more money than the &euro;7.9 billion allocation.  Some estimates suggest upwards of &euro;15 billion from the next seven-year financial programme could end up in the hands of that industry.  That is not the Europe Irish people want.<\/p> <p> The days in which the EU can celebrate itself as a peace process will be numbered unless the European Union at every level, including our Government, takes a stand on behalf of the people of Palestine.  The state of Israel, which is recognised as an apartheid, rogue state that is trampling on the human rights and lives of the Palestinian people, is considered a favoured nation by the EU.  That needs to change.  Today is a day for reflecting on the positives but it must also be a day on which we collectively determine that we will create a better EU and that Ireland will ensure that the EU delivers for citizens rather than corporations and arms companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100027#Z00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620750300,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Earlier, the Taoiseach said that what defined the European Union was that it is an institution based on the idea of rules-based international co-operation.  He argued that the European Union is a bulwark against extremism.  Let us test that proposition against the EU's relationship with Israel on the day that Israel is, once again, committing war crimes in Gaza.  As we speak, it is launching missiles which have claimed the lives of 28 innocent people in Gaza in the last 24 hours, including ten children.  One of the dead was due to marry the day after tomorrow.  This is indiscriminate murder of civilians.  As we speak, Benjamin Netanyahu is saying that he has no intention of stopping.  What did the European Union do?  We heard words of sympathy and condemnation but no action against war crimes by the rogue state of Israel.<\/p>  <p>  What preceded the current missile strikes against Gaza?  If one believes the false narrative about what goes on between Israel and the Palestinians, one is encouraged to believe this is some intractable conflict between two sides that, for some reason, cannot get on with one another.  That is not the truth about Israel.  What preceded this latest flare-up was the attempt to evict and ethnically cleanse &ndash; let us use the correct term &ndash; 28 families from the Sheikh Jarrah area of Jerusalem in order to replace those Palestinian families with illegal Jewish settlers.  It is an attempt to evict them, take their homes and put other people in those homes.  It is worth stating that those families in that area are now going to be double refugees because they came to Sheikh Jarrah after being ethnically cleansed from Haifa and Jaffa in 1948.<\/p>  <p>  In the year the Israeli state was founded and in one of the most barbaric acts of ethnic cleansing seen in the 20th century, close to 1 million people were expelled by Zionist terror gangs from their homes and villages and driven to the West Bank.  They were left to fend for themselves and it was only later that the United Nations helped them build refugee camps and new homes.  Now, they are being evicted again contrary to law and international rules, which the EU is supposed to uphold.  They are doing it again.  During the holy month of Ramadan, Palestinians were blocked from going on to the Temple Mount in an orchestrated, premeditated military action by the Israel authorities in order to provoke the Palestinians while they continued the campaign of illegal settlements and ethnic cleansing.  Annexation is much too nice a word for it.  This is ethnic cleansing.  What is happening in Gaza today is a crime against humanity.  It is a crime against humanity that, on an ongoing, systematic and orchestrated basis, Israel continues to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians, as it has done since the beginning of the state in 1948.  People need to understand that.  In Ireland, more than ever, we should know of the need to show our affinity with the Palestinians and move beyond words of concern to action.<\/p>  <p>  I wonder whether people know that in 1936, the military governor of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald Storrs, explained what the plan was for the Israeli state, which was to be set up in 1948.  He was the first military governor general since Pontius Pilate, sent in as part of the Sykes&ndash;Picot carve-up of the Middle East and the Balfour Declaration, which was to support the plan for the new state that Britain would support.  How did he describe the Israeli state they were planning to build?  He said that &ldquo;we want to build a little loyal Jewish Ulster in a sea of potentially hostile Arabism&rdquo;.  Balfour, who had signed the declaration, and Herbert Samuel, another of the main figures, had been involved in Ireland in suppressing land protests in the late 19th century.  Samuel interned 2,000 people after 1916 and oversaw the hanging of Roger Casement.  He and Balfour went on to become senior figures in mandate Palestine, planning the establishment of the Israeli state, the partition of Palestine and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in order to create a loyal little Jewish Ulster amidst a sea of potential hostile Arabism.  In other words, it was for the great powers to control the Middle East at the expense of the Palestinians and causing decades of conflict, division, murder, tyranny, the denial of democracy and all the horrors the Palestinians and people of the Middle East have had to suffer.<\/p>  <p>  Who is Israel&rsquo;s biggest trading partner?  It is the European Union.  Last year, the EU and Israel did &euro;31 billion worth of trade.  All the weasel words and words of sympathy from European leaders, when they do nothing about the murderous criminal activity that Israel is engaged in, are hollow and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s premise that the European Union is a rules-based international guardian is nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100028#AA00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1620750900,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important debate 71 years on from the Schuman Declaration, when Robert Schuman put a very simplistic idea to the people of Europe at a time when they needed simplistic ideas, sensitivity and a vision.  That vision has stood the test of time.  It is a vision which, unfortunately, in this Parliament and in parliaments across the European Union, we very rarely discuss.  In fact, it is quite clear that for many people across the EU, the best thing to do is use Europe as a handy punching bag.  The lessons about doing so can be seen just across the Irish Sea, when we look at what our friends and cousins in Great Britain have been left with.  Over 40 years of continuous lies and misinformation about the European project has led to the UK being pulled out of the European Union on the basis of yet more lies and deceit.  Even now, when the UK has left the EU, the lies and deceit continue.  One just has to pick up a particular British newspaper on any day to see a ridiculous headline about the EU.  It might be about Covid vaccines, taxation or anything else.  If in doubt, kick the EU.  That is a lesson for all of us because it is something in which we engage far too much in this country.<\/p>  <p>  We have a remarkable opportunity to contribute to a lengthy debate and to pull in many issues that are pertinent to so many people in Ireland, in jurisdictions across the European Union and in the countries it deals with every day.  How often do we have these debates?  Once a year.  How many times leading up to the Brexit process did we talk about European issues?  Brexit happened and all of a sudden we had to talk about it on a daily basis because we realised that the EU and everything that emanates from Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg comes into every aspect of our lives.  That is why we cannot simply talk about the EU during referendums or in the context of occasional annual declarations.<\/p>  <p>  It was disappointing that on Sunday, our national broadcaster - which employs one of Europe's finest journalists, who has covered the European Union for over a decade and is lauded across EU member states - did not take a single moment in either of its news bulletins to talk about the Conference on the Future of Europe, which was being launched by the President of the European Commission that day.  We say that people are removed from the European process and do not engage with it, but we are not talking about the biggest ever conversation involving European citizens that will happen over the next 12 months.  We love throwing out negativity and misinformation but we do not necessarily play our part in ensuring that real, meaningful discussions happen about the future of the European Union.  The future of the European Union matters a lot to every single person across this island, not just in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  The Conference on the Future of Europe could have so many possibilities but I fear that two things might happen.  One is that it could become the plaything of the European Union institutions, the Commission, the Members of the European Parliament and the Council, and become a detached exercise in navel-gazing.  The second is that our member states, be it their national governments, parliaments or citizenry, might not engage with the process.  We could have a Conference on the Future of Europe that discusses institutional issues rather than the practical issues that matter to everyday life.  We in this country, and our friends in the UK, have seen what happens when the practical issues on which the EU impacts are on the line.  We know what it means when people start talking about borders and checks and veterinary legislation.  We need to talk about the practical things that affect us.<\/p>  <p>  The generation that went before us knew what it was to struggle in the European process and they knew what life was like before Ireland joined the EEC nearly 50 years ago this week.  Today, we take for granted the world's most successful peace project, and all we do is hammer on about the supposed militarisation of the European Union.  The security and protection of citizens is not equivalent to a military project.  It is disappointing that people look at something that makes up 1% or 2% of the EU's seven-year budget and focus solely on that rather than on the priorities that matter for practical life on an everyday basis.  There are things people can do today that they simply could not do 20 years ago.  The EU has played a role in making sure our food and air are safe, our water is clean, our citizens' rights are protected, that we retain our freedom of movement and can live, work, travel and study in any one of the 27 member states, as well as many other states with which the European Union is in agreement.<\/p>  <p>  When Brexit happened, Irish exporters and businesses still had the opportunity to sell to the world's largest economic bloc.  When we joined the EEC in 1973, 55% of our exports went to the UK.  That figure is down to 11%.  The social progress this country has enjoyed in parallel with our membership of the European Union should never be forgotten.  We cannot take these things for granted or be allowed to forget about them or the important role the European Union plays in all our lives.  That is what people did in the UK for far too long.<\/p>  <p>  When talking about the future of Europe and reflecting on the 71 years since Robert Schuman's remarkable speech, we must ask what big achievements and challenges the European Union will lead the way on in the next decade or two.  Why is it that when people talk about the EU they fumble for achievements and then say it is great that roaming charges have been abolished?  One cannot compare roaming charges to decades of peace, freedom of movement or the vitally important opportunities and safeties given to Irish citizens.  That is why I look positively on the opportunities before the European Union today, which we in this Oireachtas should be playing our part to feed into.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about things like the post-Covid response.  Remarkable decisions were taken by the European Union in its budgetary response, through coronabonds and eurobonds and by putting funding in place that will allow this jurisdiction to economically and socially lift itself out of the malaise of this pandemic in due course.  Of course, the vaccine roll-out is a handy stick with which to beat the EU and we heard Government backbench Deputies doing so a month or two ago.  In the wake of a bye-election, the British Prime Minister said the UK's success in that regard was all because they are out of the European Union, when that has absolutely nothing to do with it.  We should be very clear.  The European vaccination programme, which is kicking into gear across this State at the moment, would not be available to us as a small state outside the European Union.  We need to be honest with ourselves.  We are very good at putting everything down and looking for the negatives but, while there are lessons to be learned from the Covid response within the EU, when we compare ourselves with the rest of the world, there are achievements as well.<\/p>  <p>  We are having this discussion 49 years after a referendum took place in this jurisdiction about whether we should join the EEC.  Two political parties at the time, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, backed that referendum and it was backed by 83% of the Irish population.  Last week, an opinion poll from European Movement Ireland showed that 84% of Irish citizens support remaining in the EU.  That is remarkable.  Nearly 50 years on, the numbers are essentially the same.  That is not always reflected in the dialogue in this Parliament or in the discussions in the media.  We like to look at all the focused, small issues.  People try to use the European Union as a scapegoat for things like agricultural inspections or restrictions that are in place to protect people and support our economy and society.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that people go down the rabbit hole of misinformation, disinformation and taking things for granted.  I am not saying the EU is perfect but why is it that every time the EU faces a challenge, the commentariat says that that challenge will define the EU?  They always ask whether the EU will survive it.  No one has ever questioned whether the United State or the German Federal Republic would survive something.  Yet, every conversation is about whether a stand-off between Germany and France over budgetary measures could pave the way for the end for the EU, or whether Ireland is going to be picked on.  People say again and again, on social media or wherever, that Ireland is going to be thrown under the bus.  For five years we heard repeatedly that the German car manufacturers and Italian Prosecco makers were going to throw Ireland under the bus but it never happened.<\/p>  <p>  We consume an awful lot of British media in this State, both broadcast and print.  They have some of the finest journalists in the world.  However, we are far too reliant on consuming the shock headlines and clickbait about straight bananas, blue passports and all these great things.  We are better than that, in Ireland and in this Oireachtas.  We use every opportunity we have, be that during post- or pre-European Council statements, the annual reflection on Europe Day, or when engaging with a European Commissioner before a committee, to give the EU a kick and blame Brussels for the decisions being made in this country, which we are required to make.<\/p> <p>This is what we must really focus on if we are going to talk about the future of Europe.  We must talk about how in this State our relationship with Europe is not necessarily a healthy one.  Even though we are so pro-European, and when we have needed solidarity we have received it, we just love giving the EU the kick.  Why?  We do it because it is easy and it gives us somewhere else to allocate the blame.  We had a very thoughtful opening speech from the Taoiseach.  I listened in intently.  He touched on the history regarding when we have needed Europe, it has been there for us.<\/p> <p> Crucially, however, what we must touch on as well is the future and I hope the Minister replying will focus on it.  Ireland's future is in the EU.  Ireland is Europe.  It has been good to us and it is about time, when we reflect on those debates and discussions, that we talk perhaps about the meaningful issues and how we can improve them, without always looking for the scapegoat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100029#BB00200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620751500,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Europe has a history of civilisation, invention and innovation, but also a history of vicious colonial powers, wars and a balance of power that was maintained through threat of war and mass armaments.  The EU project itself was born out of the end of a genocidal world war.  The EU has played its part in changing the nature of relationships across Europe.  It has played a vital role in the development of our own peace process.  I must commend the solidarity shown to Ireland throughout the entirety of the Brexit negotiations and the ongoing difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  There have obviously been difficulties regarding the vaccine roll-out, but the attempts at solidarity across the entire EU are to be commended, combined with improved operational oversight, involving the Commission and Commissioner Thierry Breton.  We have raised with him previously the issue of global solidarity concerning the vaccine roll-out, but we have now seen the President of the United States, Joe Biden, support the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, agreement waiver.  I accept there is a wider conversation regarding intellectual property rights.  What we need, however, is a best-case fix to ensure a global health solution.  We have all said this before: none of us is safe until all of us are safe.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission has engaged in a substantial amount of work in dealing with pharmaceutical companies regarding partnership agreements to deliver increased amounts of vaccines.  We must ensure this continues and that whatever needs to be done must be done to ensure maximum delivery for the entire globe and that costs are not prohibitive for those in the developing world.  There would be no better sign of an EU working for its people and for all people.  Many of us have stated in this Chamber the utter madness of Brexit, but this weekend we saw spectacular results in the Scottish elections from the perspective of people looking to achieve their independence within an EU framework.  Our congratulations should go to Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National Party, SNP.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, we must remember that the majority of people in the North voted to stay within the EU in respect of the Brexit debate.  This Brexit debate has catapulted the conversation in respect of Irish unity on this island and in the EU.  We have seen the chaos Brexit has brought.  We must ensure we have the requisite conversations and do the necessary planning in that regard.  I commend the work of many European politicians, including our own Chris MacManus, MEP, in ensuring when the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, deal was done that a resolution was added in respect of ensuring Northern representation.  We must ensure that goes from just being nice words into a concrete result.  We cannot have a democratic deficit for those who obviously will be impacted by the Irish protocol and by the rules of the EU.  Therefore, they must have a voice, and we must ensure that happens.  Europe has a major part to play in respect of connectivity, so we need the conversation to continue and we must ensure we are not wanting here in allowing for aviation connectivity, combined with ensuring that health measures are followed.  I would like to think we would do the heavy lifting on antigen testing and anything else that may be required to free us from the situation we are in.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Ballymurphy families who got an element of justice today.  It would be remiss of me not to say that we really need the European Union and the Irish Government to stand up for the rights of the Palestinian people who are being absolutely slaughtered by a war criminal-led Israeli Government that seems to operate as if it were a schoolyard bully that does not realise the disparity between itself and the Palestinians.  Land has been annexed, families have been evicted and people have been oppressed for far too long.  We must use our seat on the UN Security Council and we must also ensure that the Irish Government and the EU do their utmost.  That is how apartheid was broken in South Africa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100030#CC00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1620751500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Glaoim ar an Teachta Cathal Berry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100030#CC00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1620751500,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here to speak on Europe Day as a member of the Regional Group.  Ireland joined the European project in 1973.  I was born in 1977 and as such I am one of Ireland's lucky generations really.  We were the first generation to be born within the European Union, the first generation to benefit fully from its membership and the first generation to witness first-hand the transition from national poverty and despair to at least some measure of national prosperity and hope.  My generation did not have to read about Ireland in the 1980s, we lived through it, and through economic depression, mass unemployment, mass emigration and armed conflict.  Thankfully, that is a country which is now unrecognisable from the one we know and love today.  This transition did not happen by chance, however.  Mindful of our past, I am also acutely aware of what could have been and what would have been our alternative future had we chosen otherwise and if we had not opted to engage with the European process and be rescued from our collective predicament and our particular circumstances.  We should never, ever forget that.<\/p>  <p>  Despite all its shortcomings and well-known imperfections, therefore, the European project has been an overwhelmingly positive journey for this country and this Continent.  Let me tell the House why.  First, Europe is now at peace for the first time in centuries.  How ironic it is that this Continent, which used to be the very origin of so many global conflicts, has reinvented itself to be an exemplar of respect and a beacon of hope and stability throughout the world.  Countries are now clamouring to get in, and for good reason.  Again, this process has not happened by chance.  This progress has been brought about by the promotion of dialogue and good governance and respect for human rights and the rule of law.  Having lived in countries that do not enjoy these benefits, I assure the House that we should never, ever take them for granted, not for one second, for they are privileges bestowed on few and freedoms that others can only dream of.  One only has to observe the current difficulties in Northern Ireland as a result of the complications caused by Brexit to appreciate the involvement and positive influence of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Second, from an education perspective, the European Union has had a transformative effect.  Multiple infrastructure, education and research grants provided to our schools and universities have greatly improved the educational experience of our young people.  The Erasmus programme alone has benefited tens of thousands of Irish students since its inception decades ago.  It has promoted tolerance, understanding, cultural awareness and respect for diversity.  I am heartened to see that the Erasmus programme is going to continue for students in Northern Ireland.  That is a very positive development that I approve of immensely.<\/p>  <p>  Third, the support provided by the European Union during the recent Brexit negotiations is also worthy of particular mention.  When one contrasts the conduct and behaviour of both negotiating teams, I am very glad of which side we have chosen to align ourselves with, for one side was cavalier and reckless and the other was constructive and consistent.  The outcome was the best possible result for Ireland, given the circumstances forced upon us against our will.  Our European partners have once again showed they are reliable colleagues and the accommodation reached regarding Northern Ireland proves they are acutely aware of the particular sensitivities on this island and will continue to support us in future.<\/p> <p>Of course, it has not all been plain sailing and good news.  While I understand that the European project is still a work in progress, more needs to be done to address a number of areas.  First, Ireland is still reeling from the aftershocks from the years of austerity imposed on it not by the IMF, but by the EU institutions.  At least we can see from the response to the current crisis that they are willing to learn from their mistakes.  They are recognising this crisis to be the natural disaster that it is, rather than just an economic recession.  Instead of imposing austerity, they are providing liquidity to protect economies and societies and get us through this catastrophe, which is progress of sorts, at least.  <\/p> <p> Second, the four freedoms of the EU in respect of goods, services, capital and people have yet to be fully realised, in particular, the freedom to establish and provide services.  We should be able to purchase insurance policies from companies in France or mortgages from companies in Germany to foster competition in this country, reduce the cost of living and improve quality of life.  On the Continent, the costs of mortgages and insurance policies are half what they are here.  Therefore, much more work is required to be done in this area.<\/p> <p> Third, while the EU has showed significant leadership in tackling the problem of climate change with the European Green Deal, more needs to be done to ensure a just transition for Ireland to move to a carbon-neutral society.  As there simply is not the money available to retrofit all homes, electrify all vehicles, provide renewable energy sources and support our farmers, more financial supports are required from Brussels to support this just transition.<\/p> <p> To conclude, if there are deficiencies in the European Union, they are not its deficiencies alone, for the shortcomings are as much our fault as that of the EU.  The European Union is not some obscure entity far away in Brussels - it is us.  We are the European Union, with the ability to shape and remake it as we see fit.  We must engage more.  I am happy to see the recently announced initiative encouraging increased representation of Irish people in the various institutions.<\/p> <p> What does the future hold for the European Union?  I look forward to the likely return of Scotland in the not-too-distant future and in time, the Union's expansion into the Balkans and beyond.  Unfinished business remains in tackling inequality, the climate emergency and addressing the challenge of ultranationalism.  This country should become more involved, engaged and interested in the project.  As a small, open economy and society, our future belongs in Europe and it is therefore very much in our interest to shape it as we see fit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100030#CC00400","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620752100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Today marks the 50th anniversary of the death of former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, who was pivotal in creating an open, inclusive, and dynamic Ireland at the heart of Europe.<\/p><p>Such forward and progressive thinking is again required.  Ireland at the heart of Europe can play a leading role in building back a more inclusive and sustainable society.  We know this to be particularly to be true in Ireland, as a small open economy at the most westerly point of the EU.  Ireland must do all that it can to remain a leading example of how to attract and grow business and be a welcoming place for tourism around the world.  We must not isolate or cut ourselves off from the rest of Europe or the wider world.  The pandemic has created a sense of inward-looking obsession, which has been damaging to both our economy and society.  Thankfully, with the vaccination programme under way, we now need to ensure that Ireland remains at the heart of Europe.<\/p><p>International travel across the EU is vital for Ireland.  This week's Irish aviation financial and traffic statistics are extremely worrying for a sector which needs to be at the heart of our economic recovery.  The Government must bring industry leaders together to implement recommendations for the safe reopening of international travel.  Air traffic decline of over 700,000 flights over the past 12 months is equal to the entire air traffic handled in this country in 1998.  I welcome the announcement of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, in the Seanad on Friday that the Government is committed to the digital green certificate proposal from the EU that would enable a return to EU-wide international travel.  Every effort must be made to achieve the alignment of travel policy across the EU to prepare for the opening of travel again.  It is vital that we have a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of certificates relating to vaccination, testing and recovery.  Ireland must make sure that it is not left behind.  As the EU home to many of the world's leading tech companies, Ireland should be leading the way in the development and execution of a digital green certificate.<\/p><p>A return to international travel is vital to the recovery of Ireland's aviation sector and the wider tourism sector in Ireland.  Too many livelihoods are at stake if we fail to act.  Aviation was one of our economy's strongest performing sectors before Covid-19, with over 140,000 livelihoods being sustained by the industry in this country.  We must protect and rebuild post Covid.  The aviation sector helped to get us out of the last recession due to its huge economic contribution to our economy.  If it does not survive, we will suffer the consequences.<\/p><p>Passenger numbers at Cork Airport, for example, fell by over 95% during lockdown compared to the same period last year.  Air traffic is not expected to recover to 2019 levels until 2024.  Cork Airport is Ireland&rsquo;s second largest international airport with 2.4 million passengers passing through it in 2018.  The airport offers more than 50 routes to destinations in the UK, Europe, and the United States.  Such a loss would not only be a huge blow to jobs in the region but to connectivity throughout the south east and the south of the country more generally.<\/p><p>Progress is being made at an EU level.  The European Parliament adopted its mandate on 29 April 2021 and the Parliament and the European Council commenced negotiations this week.  I was also delighted to read in <i>The New York Times<\/i>on Sunday that American tourists who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will be able to visit the European Union over the summer, according to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.  I must say that it is of critical importance for the Government here in the Republic of Ireland to do all it can to allow the safe reopening of transatlantic travel in alignment with many of our European neighbours in the Schengen area.  Obviously, the fact that Ireland is part of the common travel area has presented us with some minor difficulties, which could be dealt with, in my opinion.  It is critical that the Government does this.<\/p><p>The fast pace of vaccination in the United States and advanced talks between its authorities and the European Union over how to make vaccine certificates acceptable as proof of immunity for visitors, will enable the European Commission to recommend a switch in policy that could see transatlantic leisure travel restored.  This is huge news for Ireland, rural Ireland and the hospitality sector in this country, as vaccinated tourists from America represent huge economic opportunities for tourism, hospitality and aviation.  The Government must provide a clear roadmap before the end of May on inbound tourism.<\/p><p>It was heartening to see the level of solidarity among the EU member states in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are stronger together than apart.  By working together, we achieve more than on our own.<\/p><p>The next generation EU recovery plan will enable Ireland to put the necessary funding in place to make the country a greener and more digital place in which to live, raise a family and do business.  There is a huge level of supports available to grow and develop our economy.  We need to grab this opportunity to shape a bold vision for Ireland's future.  The time for action is now.  In terms of funding, Ireland is set to receive an estimated &euro;1 billion in recovery and resilience facility grants.  There will also be &euro;89 million available in 2021 under REACT-EU package and &euro;77 million from the just transition fund.  It will include specific supports for sectors that are important to Ireland's economy, such as agriculture, to secure food supplies and protect the income of farmers.  Ireland will also receive almost &euro;1.2 billion in cohesion policy allocations from the latest long-term EU budget, as well as over &euro;8.3 billion in direct payments from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.  There will also be &euro;2.25 billion available through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  The European Commission recently disbursed &euro;2.47 billion in financial support to Ireland as a first transfer under the support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, SURE, scheme. The support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms and will assist Ireland in covering the costs related to the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, which has been a critical income supplement for many people in this country.  The Commission has approved two Irish schemes worth &euro;10 million and &euro;7 million for Ireland&rsquo;s coach tourism and entertainment sectors, which were badly hit by the pandemic.It has also approved a &euro;45 million Irish scheme to support companies active in the beef sector and a &euro;60 million Irish scheme to support SMEs affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Ireland will also be the largest recipient of the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment fund, which is significantly good news for this country.<\/p> <p> I come from a farming background, as I have often discussed in the House.  It is critical for the European Union, on a day such as today, to understand that agriculture has a critical role to play in our economy in the Republic of Ireland.  Many of our farmers, particularly in the dairy sector, are engaged in some of the most sustainable practices on the planet in terms of how they treat their animals.  Their stock is reared in grass-fed settings on many farms in the country, which is something of which dairy farmers are particularly proud.  It is something that differentiates us from much of the competition on the international stage and helps us to develop markets for our produce both within and outside the European Union.<\/p> <p> In regard to the cutbacks in herd numbers that may come in the future, internationally and in Ireland, I encourage the EU to take a more sensible approach.  It should look at countries where animals are kept indoors all year around as the places to cut back, not places like Ireland where farmers engage in incredibly sustainable practices that are very well researched.  It should consider that in an economy such as ours, agriculture plays an enormous role in terms of economic investment in rural communities and the rural economy in its entirety.  In my constituency, there are tens of thousands of people who are supported by the agrifood sector, whether they are working in places like Kerrygold, on the distilling side with Jameson, or, at a primary level of the economy, directly on farms.  I know many Deputies in Munster and south Leinster are dealing with similar circumstances in their own areas.  The agrifood sector really is one of the world-leading parts of our economy and we must do everything we can to protect it.  I accept that, from a sustainability point of view, it is important that we find new ways to incentivise farmers financially to engage in more sustainable practices to help the climate, internationally and on a European level.  However, this needs to be led from the top down, at Government and at European level.  It is enormously important that we keep that in mind.<\/p> <p> I have already mentioned the aviation sector.  I reiterate that I am exceptionally worried about Ireland's speed of development in terms of the digital green certificates and how well connected we are going to be to the entirety of the European Union over the next couple of months.  There are many thousands of people vaccinated in Ireland who would love to re-engage in international travel when it is deemed safe to do so.  We seem to be a little behind our European colleagues in terms of how we are going to deal with this particular issue.  It must be addressed as quickly as possible because it is critical to balanced regional development in this country.  I am thinking of the airport in Cork, where a great deal of enormously positive work has been done in recent times.  I am also thinking of our major international airport in Dublin.<\/p> <p> Having transatlantic options and the European Union becoming, once again, a major host of North American tourism are of critical importance to the constituency of every Deputy.  According to some hoteliers to whom I have spoken, up to 75% of their revenue comes from guests from the US and those guests account for 65% of bookings.  This shows that US customers are an incredibly important part of tourism in this country.  We need to move in lockstep with our European colleagues to ensure hospitality gets the strongest possible reopening later this year.  That will be beneficial not just to the hospitality sector but also to the aviation sector.  I have pointed out in the House before that 140,000 jobs in Ireland are supported by aviation.  The sector is enormously important and it needs to play a firm and significant role in the economic recovery of this country in the post-Covid era.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100031#DD00200","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620752700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Mattie McGrath.<\/p>  <p>  Last Sunday, 9 May, the member states of the European Union celebrated Europe Day.  This year, the day took on a special dimension with the launch of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  In the context of the fatigue of the pandemic and the longing for stability and predictability, Europe has entered a crisis stage.  Crisis fatigue has now become a widespread sentiment in Europe, especially in Ireland.  Evidence in replies to a series of parliamentary questions from my office confirms that the Government blindly supported the EU negotiation mandate in respect of the Brexit negotiations on fishing, giving away 25% of our pelagic fish.  Here we are again now, with the so-called weighing debacle leaving every fisher and processor up and down the country shocked.  Another European rule was thrown in on top of us and the Government accepted it.<\/p>  <p>  The mismanagement of this entire debacle is adding to the anti-European sentiment in our country.  On face value, it is an act of madness to throw the fisheries industry into turmoil in the space of one hour.  On 16 April at 4 p.m., the industry was told that everything was normal.  At 5 p.m., nothing was normal and a new regime was in place.  This is not acceptable behaviour from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  Earlier today, representatives of the SFPA told the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine that they are in negotiations with the industry, but representatives of the industry told the committee it knew nothing about this.  We are being misled.  I asked the Taoiseach to set time aside today to debate the weighing issue but he ignored my call.  Ireland has the most regulated fishing industry in the world because of the EU insistence on trying to squeeze Irish fishermen out of the seas.  It is astonishing that the Government is assisting it to do so instead of getting Europe to back off Irish fishermen and give them a chance to survive.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving that will not be an easy thing at this stage.  We see how the European bureaucrats enjoy the comfort and conformity of weak Governments such as this Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Government.  That weakness allows the unelected bureaucrats who roam the corridors in Brussels to dictate issues that impact on Irish people on a daily basis.  The world will be different after this pandemic.  In that new world, it is crucial that the European Union does not leave ordinary people and rural communities like those in Ireland behind.  It is important that our Government stands up for the best interests of citizens when exchanging views on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100032#EE00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1620752700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this very important matter.  There is no doubt in the world but that we have benefited magnificently from Europe over the past 40 to 50 years.  However, we are now at a crossroads and we may no longer get as much out of Europe as we would like.  We are getting a lot of dictation and directives that are hurting people, including farmers and working-class communities.  The climate change directives are pushing our society towards a radically different future that will make many of our citizens in rural Ireland poorer, as well as people right across the country and in the rest of Europe.  That is my considered opinion.<\/p>  <p>  We are hearing a lot of talk at present about reducing the dairy herd.  Deputies in this House have pointed out that Irish farmers produce the best milk in a cleaner and more efficient way than do many of the factory farmers in Europe.  Irish farmers feed their cattle on green grass for most of the year and they must be rewarded for that.<\/p>  <p>  This State and this Government have not demanded sufficient funds from Europe for basic infrastructure.

It seems Frankie has been put forward to answer everything in here.  It just goes to show that the Government has no respect for this House.  Members of the Government love to pay homage to the European bureaucrats, and the bureaucrats know it.  That is why we are being penalised, perished and literally terrorised by these non-elected bureaucrats of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said earlier in reply to Deputy Nolan's question about the situation with the selling of veterinary medicines by merchants, \"Oh, it is a European directive.\"  That is a reply he is good at giving.  France gets these European directives and what does it do with them?  It tears them up and puts them in the bin.  We are the best boys in the class for obeying European directives.  That is what we are good at, but we are feeble and inadequate in applying for funds, even those set up for recovery from the Covid pandemic.  I nearly said \"plandemic\" instead of \"pandemic\" and I do not know whether there was not a bit of a plan.  In fact, there is a plan in all of this, as I said a week or two weeks ago to the Taoiseach.  Our country has given away so many of its freedoms during this pandemic.

Even at that time, in 2000, the deficit was &euro;75 billion in our favour, and that figure has only grown in recent years.  It is vital to remember that.<\/p>  <p>  We have talked about how great Europe is and how it has delivered peace across the world.  The asylum and migration policies of the EU have enabled and indirectly contributed to the deaths of untold numbers of people, including children and babies, in the seas around Europe.  There is, for example, an ongoing humanitarian crisis in a camp in Lesbos where there are more than 7,000 people seeking asylum, over 2,000 of whom are children.  The camp has just 350 toilets and 36 shower cabins.  People are dying when they come to Europe because Europe has facilitated the devastation of African countries.  We talk about peace.  EU representatives are currently in Mali, bringing so-called peace to the country.  They will be in Mozambique soon.  We will be going there to facilitate the colonial ambitions of Portugal, France and countries like them to ensure they get their cut out of Africa.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that Europe stands up for the Palestinian people and clarifies what relationship Israel has with the European Union.

Forgive me if I do not join in the hymn of praise.  I am, nevertheless, obliged to say I am a proud Irishwoman and European woman.  However, nowhere in the speech given by the Taoiseach did he refer to Palestine.  I am going to quickly go back to something that was said earlier.  One of the Social Democrats Deputies referred to the greatest threat to the European project as poverty.  I second that.  Poverty and inequality are threats, as is the twisting of language.  The Minister and Minister of State should note that.  Language means nothing any more when Israel tells us it had military targets.  Nine children, among many other innocent people, are dead at a military target.  Israel is one of the EU's biggest partners.  Something is seriously wrong here.  It is a serious threat to democracy when we twist language on its head.<\/p>  <p>  I will not get through all of the notes I have made out but I will speak about the image of Europe that I see.  Imagine having to declare this, but I am someone who, proudly, has family in Germany who speak fluent German.  I am proud of them.  We have all spent time in Germany.  Let us leave that aside and look at the image we see of Europe as it progresses.  We see fortress Europe and deaths in the Mediterranean Sea.  I do think I will ever swim in the Mediterranean again, out of respect.  The deaths of 621 migrants have been recorded in 2021, up to the end of April.  Some 19,000 migrants have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean in the past six years.  There has been a marked increase in the ratio of deaths to attempted crossings.  The Minister of State is familiar with these figures but chooses not to use them.  The Taoiseach chooses not to use them either.  We are building up fortress Europe and an \"us and them\" mentality.  That is the greatest threat to democracy.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be more than familiar with the Frontex agency.  I understand it is being investigated by the European Anti-Fraud Office, among other investigations.  It is the agency the European Union has tasked with looking after our borders.  It is working in collusion with the Libyan Government so that people are sent back to Libya.  We have a terrible agreement with Turkey.<\/p>  <p>  I have the greatest of respect for the Minister of State and I accept his bona fides on foreign affairs but surely in the midst of this hymn of praise to Europe, 71 years after the Schuman Declaration, we should have the confidence to ask if we have grown in wisdom.  Has the European project grown in wisdom such that we realise when we distinguish between \"them\" and \"us\" that we are going to lose?  The European project has failed to look at getting rid of intellectual property rights in the face of a pandemic.  One year after the pandemic began, it has made no progress in that regard.  In that way, we reinforce the \"them\" and \"us\" mentality that turns the Mediterranean into a coffin, a place in which people have died.  If we are proud Europeans, surely that is what we should be looking at today.  Surely we can be leaders in the world and show people that what is so important about Europe is that we are open and inclusive, and will actively work with others.  When wrong is done, as is the case in Israel, we need to show that we, as a small country, have the courage to say we will not tolerate it in our name, nor will we allow Europe to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100033#FF00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1620753300,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am sorry I was not here for all of this debate but I got a sense towards the end of the debate of some of the criticisms of, and frustrations with, Europe as it is today.  I would be the first to recognise that Europe is far from perfect but the fact that we have regular, open debate and often strong disagreement on some of the issues that have been raised is a reflection of a European Union that is much bigger and more diverse than it ever has been and which contains different political perspectives.  At the same time, the positives and strengths of the European Union far outweigh its weaknesses and inadequacies.  It is up to us, as democrats, and up to me, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to ensure that an Irish perspective and value system have the greatest possible influence on the collective approach the European Union takes.  That is why, for example, in the context of the Mediterranean, we sent, for the first time ever, a Naval Service vessel on a humanitarian mission of such a scale.  In fact, we sent a series of vessels, one after the other.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the House for making time available for statements to mark this year's Europe Day and Europe week.  I thank the Taoiseach and all the Deputies who have spoken for their contributions and work on a European stage.  <\/p>  <p>  On Israel and Palestine, I hope Deputy Connolly will be around later for parliamentary questions on foreign affairs when I will address that issue in some detail.<\/p> <p>It is difficult to do so now at the end of a debate.<\/p> <p> Over the past year, the EU endured a period of enormous change.  It has faced an unprecedented global pandemic, which has impacted on the health of our peoples and shaken our societies and economies.  It has also negotiated and navigated the formal departure of the UK from the Union.  Europe Day is an important opportunity for us to reflect on the resilience of the Union in tackling a series of unprecedented crises over the past decade.  Member states, of course, have their occasional disagreements but we all agree that the major challenges of our time require a global response, shaped by an ambitious European Union.  Europe is at its best when we act in unity and solidarity.<\/p> <p> Ireland's vitality and evolving national identity remain inextricably linked to the success of the European Union.  We need, therefore, to be more active than ever in shaping and influencing the Union and its priorities for the future.<\/p> <p> Above all, Europe Day and Europe Week are about celebrating the EU's contribution to peace and unity over the past 71 years since the Schuman Declaration, which was referred to earlier, was signed in 1950.  That is something I do not believe anyone in this House takes for granted.  We must never cease to remind ourselves, especially our young people, that the Union remains at its core an inspiring example of peacebuilding and reconciliation based on the rule of law, not force of arms.  We should cherish its values, avail of the opportunities it provides, be ambitious for its global role and deliver change, where required.  There is a constant need for change and development.<\/p> <p> Solidarity is a necessary cornerstone of European unity.  Throughout the Brexit process, Ireland consistently received and was grateful for such solidarity.  Representatives from our fellow member states visited the Border, listened to our concerns and stood firmly by us through the challenging negotiations between Brussels and London.  The Union put its concerns and those of Ireland at the heart of all its negotiations.<\/p> <p> Of course, the House is keenly aware of the challenges that have arisen in the implementation of the protocol.  Yesterday, I met with Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d, who has become a true friend of Ireland and shows leadership and vision in trying to find constructive solutions to the ongoing negotiations with the UK.  The Government fully supports his efforts to agree a roadmap which can achieve the implementation of the protocol.  I welcome the ratification of the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement and look forward to an early establishment of its implementation structures, particularly at the partnership council, which should meet in the first week of next month.<\/p> <p> On Europe Day last Sunday, the Conference on the Future of Europe was officially launched in Strasbourg.  Ireland fully supports the conference and our national launch event will take place on Friday.  As we begin to emerge into a new era of European recovery, it is timely to engage in some reflection on what kind of Europe we want.  We want to see an inclusive conference with citizen engagement at the forefront.  It is the Government's view that the focus of the work of the conference should be on practical policy issues rather than abstract debates on how the EU is governed or how it operates in the context of inter-institutional discussions.<\/p> <p> Following the launch of the conference in Ireland, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for EU Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will manage our national programme over the next year.  Through this programme, the Government is strongly committed to hearing the voices of young people and also the views of EU citizens living in Northern Ireland.  The conference programme will include a number of all-islands events as well.<\/p> <p> This year's Europe Week has been accompanied by an important milestone in the work led by the Minister of State and me.  I will now take the opportunity to inform the House about that milestone.  Last week, we launched A Career for EU, Ireland's new strategy to increase our representation among the staff of the EU institutions and agencies.  The promotion of EU careers in Ireland is a key whole-of-government priority.  We recognise that more must be done to encourage and help Irish people to successfully apply for posts in the EU institutions when many Irish senior officials are about to retire.  This new strategy contains commitments to expand our existing EU careers, a promotional campaign across second and third level institutions, commitments to increase the supply of suitable candidates and to provide tailored support for Irish candidates for EU recruitment competitions, as well as measures to increase the European expertise of officials in the Civil Service.<\/p> <p> Once again, I thank the House for its sustained engagement on European issues.  Today's debate demonstrates our shared commitment to the Union and how it is central to the progress of our own country.  Since its foundation, the Union has faced many challenges.  Its demise has frequently been predicted.  Rather than retreat and stagnate, the EU has been at its best when responding to the greatest challenges with ambition and unity.  Today, we respond collectively to the systemic impact of the pandemic, provide global leadership on sustainable climate policies, ensure the highest standards in the regulation of the digital sector and insist that respect of human rights and the rule of law are cornerstones of civilised global engagement.  We should certainly not be complacent, however.  If the Union has risen to challenges and overcome them, it is only because of the sustained commitment and effort of its citizens, parliaments and governments working together.  Ireland&rsquo;s voice in and contribution to the Union is more necessary and important than it has ever been.  Our fellow Europeans want to hear ideas.  They want our active contribution, ambition and solution-oriented approach.  I am confident that we can fulfil and surpass these expectations.<\/p> <p> As I said, I look forward to taking questions on some of the issues that were specifically raised with regard to Israel and Palestine on Question Time later this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100033#FF00900","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Property Market: Motion [Private Members]","time":1620753900,"counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100034#GG00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1620753900,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  \tnotes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the housing crisis continues to spiral out of control;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; residential property prices have increased by 3 per cent in the 12 months to February;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; residential property prices have increased by 88.5 per cent since early 2013;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; high rents and residential property prices are making it increasingly difficult for workers, families and struggling home buyers to purchase and own their own home;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; institutional investors holding rental property avail of significant tax advantages and exemptions granted to them by the Government;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; these institutional investors include Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), introduced by the Fine Gael-led Government in the Finance Act 2013, and Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs);<br \/><br \/>&mdash; REITs and IREFs pay no corporation tax on income from their property rental businesses;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; REITs and IREFs pay no capital gains tax accruing on the disposal of assets of their property rental businesses;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; institutional investors, including REITs and IREFs: <blockquote> \t&mdash; enjoy tax advantages and exemptions that are distorting the housing market; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; are displacing workers, families and struggling home buyers in the residential property market; <\/blockquote>&mdash; institutional investors: <blockquote> \t&mdash; have developed monopolistic and oligopolistic pricing power in local areas throughout the State, distorting rental and property markets to the detriment of workers, families and struggling home buyers; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; are pricing average and low-income earners out of purchasing or renting from the private market; <\/blockquote>&mdash; the displacement of workers, families and struggling first-time buyers, through the purchase of existing property in the residential market by institutional investors, has been taking place for several years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Government policies have facilitated, incentivised and encouraged the displacement of struggling home buyers by institutional investors in the residential property market;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; recent purchases of residential property by institutional investors in Mullen Park, Maynooth and Bay Meadows, Dublin, that have displaced workers, families and struggling home buyers, are a direct consequence of these policies; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; investment by these institutional investors in the residential property market reached &euro;1.2 billion in 2020, and is expected to grow in this and subsequent years without immediate policy intervention; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce legislation to end the tax advantages and exemptions granted by the Government to institutional investors, including REITs and IREFs, in the residential property market;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce legislation to impose a stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of residential property by institutional investors including REITs and Irish Real Estate Funds;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; direct the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to bring forward, as a matter of urgency, measures to restrict the activity of institutional investors in the residential property market and their displacement of workers, families and struggling home buyers from the market; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; further direct the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to consider, as a matter of urgency, amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000, introducing tenure type and mix as a matter of consideration in all future planning applications and approvals.  <\/blockquote>  <p>T&aacute;im ag roinnt mo chuid ama.  Molaim an r&uacute;n seo ar son Theachta&iacute; D&aacute;la Shinn F&eacute;in.  Le r&oacute;fhada anois, an polasa&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag an Rialtas seo agus an Rialtas roimhe n&aacute; cead agus spreagadh a thabhairt do chist&iacute; idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta theacht isteach anseo agus gn&aacute;thdhaoine a ghlas&aacute;il amach as an margadh.  Feidhm an r&uacute;in at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair n&aacute; deireadh a chur leis an scannal seo anois agus go deo. <\/p><p>In May 2020, one of the State's leading wealth advisory firms circulated a paper to potential investors in the housing market in which it gave an honest and accurate account of Government policy and its impact on renters and homeownership.  The paper stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe current high level of house prices and rents in Ireland&rsquo;s residential property market have been driven in a significant way by the Government&rsquo;s housing policy with favourable policies attracting institutional investors in the market <\/blockquote>  <p>It went on to state:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe aim of institutions is to maximise their rental income from their properties and developers are also designing apartment blocks to maximise this income for institutions rather than aiming to meet the needs of society <\/blockquote>  <p>The investment advisory firm concluded accurately when it stated, &quot;The current housing policy has benefited both institutions and developers at the expense of individual buyers.&quot;  That is the truth of this Government policy.  Those are not words according to me or Sinn F&eacute;in but to the industry speaking to itself in 2020.<\/p><p>Last week, Round Hill Capital snapped up 135 homes in a new residential estate at Mullen Park in Maynooth, snatching homeownership from struggling homebuyers who had worked hard to save for deposits.  The previous week, the same fund snapped up an entire estate of 112 homes in a new development in Dublin called Bay Meadows.  For the public and whole generations locked out of homeownership by this Government and those which preceded it, this was simply the last straw.  The Government is now scrambling to fix a problem it created in the first place.  I have heard Ministers try to claim that this is something new and that it is an unintended consequence of Government policy.  Let me say very clearly that this is nothing new.  It has been going on for years.  In 2019 alone, developers sold off 2,909 newly-built homes as private rental sales in Dublin.<\/p> <p>This meant that 57%, six out of every ten, of newly built homes in Dublin were taken off the market and sold, in the majority of cases, to these investment funds.  This was in 2019, not 2021.  In the same year, more than 3,000 second-hand homes were bought by these funds.  This is not by accident, it is  by design.  The Government has facilitated and encouraged this policy.<\/p> <p> Many of these investment firms are REITs, which were introduced by means of legislation brought forward by the Fine Gael-Labour Government in 2013.  REITs pay no corporation tax on rental profit.  They pay no capital gains tax when they sell their properties and pay little in the way of stamp duty.  Many of their shareholders pay less tax on the dividends they receive than the average Irish worker does on his or her wages.  Some of them actually pay no tax at all.  These investments were afforded tax advantages by the Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in's motion calls for these tax advantages and exemptions to come to an end.<\/p> <p> Far from this being a new request from Sinn F&eacute;in, we have been calling for it to happen for years.  Only six months ago, I tabled amendments to the Finance Bill calling for the full rate of capital gains tax and a stamp duty surcharge to be applied to these funds only for them to be voted against by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens.  Now that the Government has been caught out, it is scrambling to give some appearance of action and an indication that it really wanted to do something.<\/p> <p> This motion calls on the Government to take immediate action to introduce legislation to end these tax advantages and exemptions which it and previous Governments have given these investment funds, including REITs and IREFs.  It calls for the introduction of the imposition of a stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of homes by investment funds, including REITs and IREFs, as proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in in our budget submission last year.  It urgently calls for the introduction of measures to restrict the activity of these funds and to end their price gouging, as well as the pushing out of struggling homeowners and buyers from the market.<\/p> <p> Investment funds are locking workers and families out of home ownership.  This is nothing new.  It is not an accident because it has been happening for years.  It is the direct result of the Government's policy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling it out for years.  It is now time to bring it to an end.  This motion should be supported and investment funds should be stopped from making housing unaffordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100034#GG00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620754500,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I commend Deputies Pearse Doherty, &Oacute; Broin and others in Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing this issue to the forefront of the political debate in recent months and years.  What people saw in the past couple of weeks with REITs buying whole housing estates is a reflection of what is happening up and down the country.  Many people have contacted me who have family members trying to buy homes.  A man in County Leitrim contacted me the other day.  He has two sons who he paid for to go through college.  When one of his children was sick when they were young, he could not get a medical card and had to pay for the treatment.  He subsequently had to buy health insurance.  Throughout all of his life he has paid.  Now his two sons, educated with good jobs, have no hope of affording houses.  They would need salaries of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000 per annum to buy a house in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, the Government's policies are driving this whole agenda of what it calls the professionalising of the rental sector.  What that means is making the rental sector something which will make maximum profit for large investment companies.  That is totally at odds with what the ordinary people of this country want.  It is time the Minister and the Government copped on to that.  People are seeing what the Minister is doing.  He is not working for the ordinary people of this country.  Rather, he is working for the big investors and those with the inside track.  That needs to end now.<\/p>  <p>  The reality for many people is that they just simply cannot afford to live in this country.  That is being brought home to so many.  We have a situation whereby  people work and save to buy homes for themselves and future generations of their families but the Government closes that off for them.  This is down to the Government's policies, which come from the playbooks of Thatcher and Reagan.  This is not an accident or a consequence the Government did not foresee.  The Government's policy is driven towards making the whole housing sector a commodity which can be bought and sold in order that people will be slaves to it for the rest of their lives.

Contrary to what most ordinary people think, housing units are now viewed by the State as assets for the purpose of generating capital for investors ahead of building homes for workers.  This may have come as a shock to many after what we saw happen in Maynooth.  However, this has been a visible reality within communities across Dublin Bay South and inner city Dublin for years now.  First-time buyers in communities like Ringsend, Kevin Street, Harold's Cross, Rathmines and even Ranelagh are all too familiar with seeing the same faces at each viewing, buying up home after home for a third party on behalf of these investment funds.  Dublin Bay South has traditionally not been a strong support base for Sinn F&eacute;in.  However, one of the key elements as to why Sinn F&eacute;in did so well there in the general election was down to the then Government's failure on housing.  We had canvassers from Ranelagh and Rathmines.  We got votes in those areas because people were fed up with the Government's housing policy.  Anyone who thinks that a Fine Gael success in the forthcoming by-election in the constituency is going to be a slam dunk is going to be in for a surprise.  The issue of housing has not gone away.<\/p>  <p>  Those who were shocked at what happened in Maynooth were silent when the same thing was effectively happening in the inner city, with working-class families being pushed out right across the Docklands.  In communities in that area, families had to watch their sons and daughters being pushed far outside those communities and having to live from them and their friends on foot of the actions of vulture funds and the big tech companies that rip communities apart.  Once again, we see profit margins being allowed to reign supreme over local communities.  As is often the case, these crises only seem to trigger outrage in the media when the issue transcends traditional class lines.  Housing needs to be seen as a building block for communities not an asset from which to make financial profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100035#HH00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1620754500,"counter":242,"content":"<p>There is no consensus on housing.

This Government and that which preceded it have left ordinary working people who work hard and want to own their own homes to the mercy of the market.  The Minister has made sure that the private housing market is what comes first.<\/p>  <p>  The victims in this are the people who get up early in the morning and work until late in the evening.  They have no chance to buy homes of their own because of the Government's failures.  Its affordable housing plan lies in tatters because it did not offer the necessary solutions.

In the Ireland built by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, we have a situation where landlords come before tenants.  We see this with rising rents year on year, month on month, and week on week.  We saw in the past and we are seeing it again where banks are being put first above people who own their own home and are in mortgage distress.  Now we see vulture funds and institutional investors swooping in to buy properties that should be available for people who want to own their own homes.<\/p> <p>As a consequence, house prices are being pushed up.

I believe members of the public will agree with me when I say Sinn F&eacute;in is delivering a clear message today to Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party that the people will not allow themselves to be caught a second time.  The shame in this belongs squarely at the Government's door.  Let the message be clear and unambiguous - this Government must put an immediate end to the sweetheart tax deals that have facilitated wealthy investment funds in gobbling up housing at the expense of ordinary people attempting to get on the property ladder.<\/p>  <p>  From the off, we have witnessed both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael defending the tax advantages they have made available to these vulture funds, which squeeze out of the market first-time buyers such as those in Mullen Park in Maynooth.  In my constituency of Wicklow, Glenveagh Properties is on course to secure over &euro;60 million for the sale of 100 apartments at its Marina Village scheme in Greystones to the German investor, Realis.  In the rental sector in Wicklow, renters are being forced to pay an average rent of &euro;1,324.68 per month.  Alongside the average rent in County Kildare, these are the highest rents in the country outside Dublin.  The Minister refuses to put rent caps in place to tackle that.

If and when they can afford to purchase a home, it often results in them having to leave their community in search of something affordable because in the Minister's world, &euro;400,000 is affordable in County Wicklow.  That is certainly not a world ordinary working families live in.  When these people are forced out of their communities they leave behind their family supports and the social fabrics of their communities.  This Government is responsible for one of the worst social disasters in the history of the State, the impact of which will most probably be felt for many decades to come.  Shame on the Minister, his party and this entire Government of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and their colleagues in the Green Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100036#JJ00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1620755100,"counter":245,"content":"<p>There has been a housing crisis in this State for decades.  It has many facets and it has been presided over by this Government and previous Governments.  That is a fact that cannot be denied by the Government or its predecessors.  They have presided over the chaos that is housing policy in this State.  They have facilitated developers continuously, year in and year out, decade after decade.  Even when developers went bang, Governments have stepped in and bailed them out.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many facets to this crisis, as I said, but the latest one was predicted and the Government was warned about it, yet it took no action.  In fact, the Government facilitated and encouraged international REITs and Irish real estate funds, IREFs, to come in and invest in housing in Ireland.  The Government encouraged them to compete with ordinary workers in this State who are trying their best to get money together for a deposit and obtain the permissions they need to draw down a mortgage for what might be a starter home or, in some cases, a dream home or \"forever home\", as they are known.  What happens when these people have everything in place?  The funds the Government has encouraged overbid them because they offer sometimes &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000 or even &euro;80,000 more per home than the poor Irish taxpayers trying to buy these homes can afford.  That is the Government's policy; it is what the Minister has stood over.  These people have been let down by the Government, yet we have heard the Minister's spokespeople say over the years that there is not a problem.<\/p>  <p>  In my area, ordinary workers are now being asked for huge sums.  The price on the market for a council house in Ballyfermot, for instance, is &euro;300,000.  Down the road in Crumlin, prices of &euro;400,000 are being sought.  This is for an ordinary corporation house.  There is nothing wrong with the area.  What is wrong is the price and the people who have presided over that are this Government and its predecessors.  They have encouraged multinationals to invest through the REITs and IREFs to ensure normal working people cannot afford homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should think back to when he may only have had a few bob and was trying to get a home for himself.  Even if he was trying to rent one of the houses I mentioned, it would cost him &euro;2,400 per month to rent a council house in Ballyfermot or Crumlin.  That is crazy.  No ordinary worker can afford that.  The Minister is saddling people with huge debts.  Not only that, he is now encouraging these firms to come in and invest in Irish property so they can make huge profits without paying tax and without benefiting the State or society.  It is time for this to end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100036#JJ00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1620755100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;notes that:  \t&mdash; the Government is fully committed to tackling high rents and ensuring an increase in the supply of affordable high quality rental accommodation through continued<br \/><br \/>significant capital investment, including Cost Rental and other means and in a manner that respects the security of tenure for renters by ensuring equity and fairness for landlords and tenants;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 relating to Rent Pressure Zones are due to expire at the end of December, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will bring forward comprehensive new protections for tenants, balanced with constitutional property rights in the coming months;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government is committed to improving the security of tenure for tenants through legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration, subject to legal advices;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the new Affordable Housing Bill 2020 sets out the legislative basis for Cost Rental for the first time in the history of the State;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the first Cost Rental units will be delivered this year and significantly expanded by the Government over the coming years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has increased funding and capacity for the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to help further protect tenants, and the significant ongoing sustained funding provided to local authorities to inspect rental properties and the strong legislative framework under which they currently operate has made a positive contribution to supporting the ongoing improvement of standards and to ensuring the availability of an increasingly high quality stock of rental accommodation in Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; as per the commitment in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, the new whole-of-Government plan for housing &lsquo;housing for all&rsquo;, that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage intends to publish later this year, will ensure that the provision of an adequate supply of high quality affordable rental accommodation remains a cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s policy under the plan; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has provided, and will continue to provide, enhanced income supports and protections for tenants, particularly the most vulnerable tenants, that are necessary during this pandemic; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government keeps the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 under constant review and will make any necessary enhancement to the legal enforceability of RTB determination orders, in consultation with the RTB.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Government.  At the heart of my approach to housing is a simple argument that owning a home is good for individuals, families, communities and our country.  It rests on a fundamental belief that persons earning a decent wage should be able to buy their own home.  What happened in Maynooth last week was unacceptable.  It flies in the face of that core Government policy and belief.  It offends our shared sense of fairness that if one works hard, one should have something to show for it.<\/p><p>Our democracy is founded on the idea that our children can do better that us, just as our parents hoped for.  We need a housing system that reflects this.  I assure renters, those saving now for deposits and adults living at home with their parents - whom I have spoken about on many occasions since taking over as Minister - that the Government is taking action to stop this from happening.  In opposition I brought forward legislation in this regard and flagged the matter as recently as April.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I are reviewing options right now to make a real, positive impact in this space and together we will bring forward measures on behalf of Government to address this issue.<\/p><p>Over the past ten months, the Government has brought forward the largest housing budget on record and the most ambitious targets in the history of the State.  These included &euro;3.3 billion for housing alone and 9,500 new build social homes as part of a programme to build 50,000 new social homes over the term of this Government.  The Government is the largest builder and player in this State in relation to the provision of homes.  By the summer, we will have passed two major Bills, the affordable housing Bill and Land Development Agency Bill, both of which will put home ownership at the centre of the solution to our housing crisis.  These are specific measures to help generation rent become a generation of people who can afford their own home at an affordable rate.  These are real measures and policies, not empty rhetoric.<\/p> <p>In July, the new Housing for All plan will lay out a comprehensive new vision for affordable homes as part of our overall housing strategy.  We are levelling the playing field for first-time buyers to give working people a real chance to realise their dream of home ownership.<\/p> <p> In contrast, the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, which has brought forward this motion, is pretending to be a friend of first-time buyers when everything it does points to the contrary.  Its cigarette box affordable housing scheme excludes a nurse and garda on average income and comes with a major catch, which is that people do not own their homes at the end.  Today Sinn F&eacute;in even attempted further delay by filibustering the affordable housing Bill at committee, which is landmark legislation that will be a leap forward in tackling the housing crisis.  It is the most comprehensive legislation for affordable housing and from day one, Sinn F&eacute;in has tried to delay its progress and stop it in its tracks.<\/p> <p> I will not abandon first-time buyers or use them as a political pawn like the Sinn F&eacute;in Party does. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100036#JJ00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620755700,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Get out of here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100037#KK00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1620755700,"counter":249,"content":"<p>This Government will help them out and I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will see fit to support the affordable housing Bill when it stops delaying its passage in committee.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's political tactics are slash and burn, not build and renew.  First-time buyers are collateral damage in that political game, which is what part of today's motion is.  Its record on helping first-time buyers is all too clear.  The party publicly opposed the help-to-buy scheme, which ensured 22,000 homeowners got keys to their doors.  Deputy Doherty and his colleagues oppose that scheme and would scrap it.  They opposed the Land Development Agency Bill, which brings about a land management agency to put the State's land to productive use to deliver affordable and social homes for working people.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposes it.<\/p>  <p>  It also opposed the shared equity scheme and housing development motions on 16 of 21 occasions at Dublin City Council.  It has opposed 975 homes being built in Clondalkin, including 30% social housing.  It opposed 500 homes in Tallaght, of which 80% would have been social or affordable purchase.  It opposed 278 homes in Swords and continues to oppose 1,200 homes in Donabate, 238 of which are affordable and another 238 of which are social homes.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in is doing on the ground.  They are more real examples of the Sinn F&eacute;in mantra of \"I am all for housing but\".<\/p>  <p>  We now know what Sinn F&eacute;in is against but we never know of what it is in favour.  The country needs approximately 350,000 new homes by 2030, with funding of over &euro;120 billion.  How much of this does Sinn F&eacute;in believe should come from the private sector?  There is a giant hole in the Sinn F&eacute;in doughnut-shaped housing policy, and it is the private sector.  Small and medium-sized builders will play a massive role in driving supply and this is key to addressing the crisis.  In the Sinn F&eacute;in vision, they have no role but we need people to build homes.  One would think, listening to Sinn F&eacute;in, such builders are not required and the party could not even bring itself to call for the construction sector to be reopened after the pandemic.  This Government and I will use every tool in our armoury to get bricks and mortar put on the ground for homes that working people can afford.  To have a real impact on this, we must have pragmatic measures with both the public and private sector.  We cannot fight with one hand tied behind our back.<\/p>  <p>  We should not allow one party's perfect be the enemy of the common good.  Half-baked Opposition claims that the public sector could next year deliver 20,000 units are really the stuff of Legoland building.  Sinn F&eacute;in claims it could deliver 20,000 public homes this year but Deputy &Oacute; Broin will not say where they would be, how they would be built, who would build them or how long it would take.  This completely ignores the reality of the pandemic.  We can see the party's trenchant criticism of specific housing projects, which have real plans to deliver homes for working people, without even thinking about the party's misleading ownership schemes.  Political grandstanding will not build new homes but practical policies will.  That is what the Government is committing to do through our affordable housing Bill, our Land Development Agency Bill and the single biggest budget in the history of the State related to housing.  <\/p>  <p>  Inevitably, the pandemic and the current shutdown of the sector will have a severe impact on output this year.  We will need to be imaginative in the coming months to drive on supply by tackling vacancies and improving delivery.  Silver bullet solutions like this motion will not cut it but we can also put in place legislative foundations for a new approach to this crisis, where home ownership can be put right back on the table for a generation.  It is the very subject I have spoken about since the day I took over as Minister.  That has been smothered up to now by rising rents and job uncertainty.  We will use targeted planning and taxation measures to protect buyers from predatory actions such as those we saw in Maynooth, and will ensure that private institutional investment is focused where it needed, that is, to boost supply rather than take from it.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise that the Government must tackle this matter and we are committed to doing so in a real and effective way by putting home ownership in a central position and passing our affordable housing and Land Development Agency Bills and by launching and rolling out the very first cost rental affordable scheme in the history of the State.  These are real measures that will take effect in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I have met the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and it is a priority for our Government to address the issue of bulk-selling of properties from under the noses of first-time buyers.  We will take measures promptly to ensure a fix can be put in place.  I hope that when measures are brought forward, the Deputies opposite who introduced this evening's motion will see their way to supporting them.<\/p>  <p>  I also hope that when the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, in particular, and others look at the measures being brought forward by the Government with the affordable housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill, it will be honest with the people they purport to represent.  Within those Bills are real measures, money and resources to support first-time buyers and ensure people can realise the dream of home ownership.  This is a whole generation that has, for too long, been locked out of that market.  It is a priority for the Government that people can own their own home at an affordable rate and have somewhere secure to call their own, whether it is to rent or buy.  It is what we are focused on doing.  We will detail further measures on how to protect first-time buyers in future shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100037#KK00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1620755700,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The Sinn F&eacute;in motion stands up for young people.

I would like to talk about the impact of investment firms buying up large swathes of housing in Ireland from the perspective of young people, and in particular those in their 20s.  It is a group that sometimes gets forgotten about, not just in housing but in an awful lot of things in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI&rsquo;s Poverty, Income Inequality and Living Standards in Ireland report, parts of which were published today, points to a significant share of young people facing excessive housing costs in comparison to their incomes.  That will not come as a surprise to any of us.  It examines the unique set of circumstances facing young people who are, in the main, engaged in insecure employment and who have been forced by successive failure in housing policy by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments into a rental market with significant and acute affordability issues.  I know housing affordability and availability is an issue that affects all age groups but for young people, the prospect of home ownership has collapsed in recent decades.  The findings paint a stark picture of housing affordability for young people in Ireland in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The consequences of declining rates of home ownership for young people over several generations mean that these same young people are forced into the private rental market, where affordability has been aggravated by eye-wateringly high rents.  Outside of the capital and in rural areas like my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the private rental market has become increasingly unaffordable for many young people.  That is if one can find a property to rent.  It is nearly impossible to find a property to rent and it is impossible to afford it as they are in the region of &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,500 per month for Kilkenny and Carlow.  One can forget about it if one is trying to find a place that will take the housing assistance payment, HAP, as one has no chance.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister might not like it and he can have a go at us all he wants but everybody on the street knows the reality and the consequences of allowing investment firms to buy up huge swathes of homes in newly-built housing estates throughout the country.

We have heard many times over the years of the consistent and constant failure to build council houses, affordable cost rental homes and houses that can be bought at affordable rates.  We have heard all the stories in recent days: of people who are paying extortionate rates of rent; of those who are lucky enough to avail of HAP and who still have to pay top-ups; and of the huge amount of money we spend on HAP as a State.  In 2020 we spent in or around &euro;464.6 million on HAP.  This is crazy.  We are on the side of IREFs and REITs and we have facilitated them with tax breaks every which way.<\/p>  <p>  It is all well and good to say that public expenditure can only cover X, Y or Z but there are many means of drawing down money, whether that is through Europe or private money, but it needs to deliver for people.

The system we have is utterly dysfunctional and is not working for anybody.  There is talk about the Land Development Agency, LDA, being a solution and selling land to developers, as opposed to using our own land.  Even if that is the case, we will be getting developers to build on it to produce what we need to produce.

The Minister knew this was happening in many communities around the State and he wrote the rules to encourage the institutional investors.  Workers who are paying rents that are through the roof are competing with these international funds that can buy up whole estates and gazump them completely.  It is soul-destroying for people of my age who feel they have no hope of ever having a permanent home.  For them, income limits for social housing have not been changed in years and many of them do not qualify for that.

I heard the Taoiseach say this week that the issue of housing is the biggest issue facing young people and I agree with him.  It is also the biggest issue facing our society more generally.  Precarious housing and precarious work produce precarious lives.  Precarious lives destroy communities and wreck social cohesion and they will destroy our social contract.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister made reference in his contribution to the fact that it used to be the case that if one studied hard, worked hard and saved hard, one had a shot at owning one's own home.  This is no longer the case for far too many people.  I have said time and again before this awful pandemic hit that this generation that was born in the 1980s and the 1990s was likely to be the first since Independence that was destined to do less well than their parents.  The ESRI report published this morning confirms that to be the case.  It makes for harrowing reading.  On all the metrics such as housing, pay and decent work and life opportunities, younger people have been the casualties.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael has told us in recent years that things are going ever so well.  On GDP terms we are but if one looks under the bonnet it tells an entirely different story.  The economic and financial disaster that was inherited from Fianna F&aacute;il in 2011 was fixed, in no small part, by the work done by my party, and by Fine Gael I must acknowledge.  It turns out though that the sacrifices made then brought about a recovery for some but left a whole generation behind, the generation at least facing the risk of being left behind.  Household wealth has grown enormously since 2013.  This is down to year-on-year growth in house prices and supply is a factor here.  Fine Gael knows where its electoral and political market is.  We are two Fine Gael housing Ministers later, all tacitly backed by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>During those years, we failed to build the public, private and affordable homes people need.  We failed to make renting secure.  We failed to see sufficient caps placed on ever-escalating record rents.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael is in an ideological cul-de-sac and it now has a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister cornered and captured.  This is truly no country for young people.  Is it any wonder that REITs and IREFs have declared open season on Ireland?  These faceless monster investment funds have it every way.  They are hoovering up everything in sight and are now outbidding would-be first-time buyers in areas such as my home town of Drogheda.  The longer the supply problem exists, the better will be the yield for these funds' investors.  These funds exploit tax rules introduced in a certain context in 2012.  Those rules have remained largely untouched since, with a small exception or two.  Almost ten years on, and in a fundamentally different housing market and environment, it is high time that time was called on certain activities of these funds.  It is morally unjust and politically indefensible that REITs and IREFs pay the same percentage rate of stamp duty on residential purchases as typical first-time buyers.  Even Boris Johnson's Conservative Party cottoned on to the impact of REITs and slapped a 15% rate of stamp duty on them, with additional surcharges in some cases.  If the political will exists in the Government, this and other very targeted tax measures could be taken to soften the cough of these vehicles that are, frankly, drunk and out of control on tax breaks.<\/p> <p> It is also open to the Government to change the tax rules that apply to these structures.  REITs elect to be considered REITs by Revenue.  There are clear rules that need to be complied with for a REIT to benefit from exemptions such as those relating to corporate tax and capital gains tax.  These rules can be amended and aligned with Government planning on housing policy in a targeted way to restrict or, indeed, end the activity that we all say we are so concerned about.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, has proposed a number of key measures that would be game changers for renters, for the provision of public, private and long-term rental homes and for first-time buyers.  She has also made some very important points about the way in which housing is discussed, the narrative around it and how it is almost always presented through the lens of a couple, and more specifically, a couple who are first-time buyers.  Housing is an issue for everyone.  Let us not forget the 400,000 people who live alone and those who want to remain as single-person households.  They also need security, certainty and a chance to own their own place.<\/p> <p> Senator Moynihan was not playing games when she pledged last week to introduce a Bill from the artist formerly known as plain old Deputy Darragh O'Brien before he entered the Customs House.  That Bill has been submitted this week in the name of Deputy Duncan Smith.  We submitted it because we believe it has potential, if amended, to be a fix for the problems we are experiencing.  The submission of the Bill is also designed to keep the Minister honest.<\/p> <p> Our view, expressed long before we reached this sorry pass, is that we need a complete and fundamental culture shift on the provision of housing and how we view housing policy more generally.  Housing ought not to be a commodity to be traded.  It is not a status symbol.  The only ladder we should associate with housing is that one we use to clean our windows.  The financialisation of housing has destroyed lives and communities.  Let us get back to building good well-designed homes and integrated communities and not just units, in the language of the business, informed by cost and profit motive.<\/p> <p> I also have a word of warning for the Minister.  The kind of investment we will need for an ambitious public home building programme will require unprecedented levels of State capital investment.  At present, we can borrow money at negative interest rates but EU spending strictures, which owe more to an economic experiment from the financial crash than to the circumstances of 2021 and beyond, could see us straitjacketed.. At the same time as we are prevented from borrowing, the European Central Bank and other central banks are flooding the markets with cheap cash.  There are vast amounts of money circulating the world in search of investment.  This includes investment in developing land and housing.  The net result of this is a bidding war for capital assets, which inevitably is causing capital asset inflation.<\/p> <p> The real effect of these investment funds outbidding each other is the impact this is having on potential first-time buyers in Ireland.  This is the real world impact.  This is the effect.  The double whammy is that, on the one hand, Europe, through its lending, fiscal and monetary policy, is funding the investors who are driving up the price of Irish houses while, on the other hand, through its borrowing policy, it is preventing the Government from borrowing in order to build sufficient numbers of public and affordable homes.  It is as if Europe were selling discount weapons to its enemies while imposing strict disarmament upon itself.  No one could argue that the combined effect of these two policies was ever intended or that it is sustainable.  Frankly, it needs to change.<\/p> <p> My firm view is that if the future of the EU is to be a strong entity to which we can all give our support, and I do, then after the pandemic we will need a Marshall plan investment approach to rebuilding our economies and to building the homes, social infrastructure and secure jobs on which social solidarity and national and EU cohesion depend.  This requires the type of investment that, frankly, anachronistic EU fiscal rules, which are completely outdated as they are structured, do not allow.  This needs to change to help us reach our ambitions for Ireland in terms of capital investment in housing and infrastructure to make sure we can rebuild our economy and rebuild our society and build back better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100038#LL00500","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620756900,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Doherty for tabling the motion.  I was looking forward to hearing what the Minister's proposals and solutions would be.  I was disappointed that instead he used most of his time to engage the usual attack on Opposition parties.  That is probably designed to deflect and avoid responsibility.  I would like to hear more proposals.  Last week, we were promised by the Minister that there would be action this week.  I hope he will carry through on that promise.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill the Minister tabled in 2019 when he was in opposition, and which was referenced by Deputy Nash, is far too weak.  Its ambition is to allow only 0% to 30% of new development land to be reserved for first-time buyers.  If we were starting at 30%, we might be going somewhere.  There is also the fact that the Bill looks at land and not the number of homes.  It looks at a percentage of the land.  It would be quite normal in a development to have the higher density homes occupying most of the land and the lower density homes being sold to individual buyers.  This aspect of it needs to be changed.  Part of this needs to come from the planning side but this will take years to kick in.  It will take far too long.  We also know there are weaknesses in the planning system with regard to enforcement.  This can only be part of the solution.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister correctly stated that there needs to be a very strong role for small and medium builders in addressing housing supply and yet there are reports today that the home building finance agency is funding large developers to build homes to sell off to investment funds and cuckoo funds and in the process is squeezing out small and medium builders.<\/p>  <p>  In 2010, 76 individual homes were bought by institutional investors.  In the first quarter of this year, a record &euro;696 million was spent by cuckoo funds, which means &euro;53 million a week was spent on buying up homes.  At the same time, we are seeing that each successive generation is less likely to own their own homes than the previous generation.  In the past decade, Irish house prices rose by just under 30%.  At the same time, rents increased by more than 60%.  In Dublin, rents have risen by 85% since early 2011.  This increasingly means that investors will get a better return on renting out homes than on providing them for sale on the open market to individual buyers. This is part of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  A paper published by Dr. Michael Byrne of UCD's school of social policy, social work and social justice on institutional investment and the private rental sector states demand on the part of international capital for real estate assets in Ireland appears to be virtually insatiable.  How does he reach this conclusion?  He looks at the yields that investors can get in Ireland from the rental sector.  He notes there is consensus that the yields are at 3.75%.  These yields are higher than the European average yields in the rental sector, which are at 3.25%.<\/p>  <p>It is not surprising that they are higher because our rents are among the highest in Europe.  Rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Dublin is higher than anywhere else in the European Union.<br\/><br\/>Irish yields compare favourably to Irish sovereign bonds which are in negative territory and they compare favourably to EU sovereign bond yields which were only 0.3% in 2020.  These conditions, which include some of the highest rents in Europe, make investment in the private rental sector very favourable for investment funds.  They do not need favourable tax treatment on top of that to encourage them.  The imbalance that this has created means the Government needs to do the opposite.  It needs to dampen the returns for institutional investors from the private rental sector to rebalance housing construction and give people a decent chance of being able to buy their own home.<br\/><br\/>The analysis that I was referring to by Dr. Michael Byrne from UCD shows that there is consensus in the property industry as to why investment in the private rental sector is such a good option for investment funds.  CBRE Ireland stated: &quot;The fundamental issue supporting the investment thesis &hellip; is the inherent supply demand balance in the residential sector&quot;.  Sherry Fitzgerald stated: &quot;The fundamentals which underpin PRS [private rental sector] demand remain strong, most notably favourable demographic and economic trends, together with a supply shortage, which has been an enduring feature of the market in recent times.&quot;  Irish Residential Properties REIT stated: &quot;There remains a clear and significant supply and demand imbalance for all tenures of housing in Ireland.&quot;  A 2020 report by GillenMarkets, a Dublin-based investment advisory firm, stated that Ireland's policy has &quot;benefited ... institutions and developers at the expense of individual buyers.&quot;  The same report notes that the biggest risk facing investors in Ireland's property market is Government intervention aimed at improving housing affordability.  As such, not only is institutional investment supported by favourable tax treatment and investment conditions, it is also supported heavily by a lack of supply to meet demand and a lack of Government intervention to ensure housing affordability.<br\/><br\/>These are not the only supports for this type of investment.  The list goes on.  There is a range of direct State financing and support for this type of investment.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have told us that we must have cuckoo funds in order to provide finance for housing.  What they did not tell us is that the State is providing some of the funding to build housing that is then sold on to these investment funds.  I already referenced the reports today from the Home Building Finance Agency, which is financing large-scale rental developments that are then being sold on to investment funds.  Funding for the agency is coming via the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, from which funding is also going straight into supporting this practice.  In addition, long-term leases from the State are guaranteeing rents for many of these investment funds.<br\/><br\/>According to Dr. Lorcan Sirr of the school of real estate and construction economics at the Technological University Dublin, local authorities are offering exceptional terms to lease new builds from funds, offering rent guarantees, property management and an obligation to return the houses as good as new after 25 years.  Dr. Sirr described the deals as &quot;unbelievably good.&quot;  I hope we hear from the Government this week what action will be taken on this issue.  Analysis by the <i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>of over 12,000 apartments and homes in Dublin city owned by institutional investors showed that 76% of them were already built when they were bought out by investment funds.<br\/><br\/>In addition to all of the measures the Government is putting in place to support investment funds, the favourable tax treatment, the lack of intervention on affordable housing, the favourable market conditions, the excellent yields that investors get and the long-term leasing, the Government has also created another incentive for investors to come in and buy up homes.  In the immigrant investor programme, the only thing someone has to do to get a passport and citizenship, including for his or her family, is buy two homes valued at &euro;500,000 each.  That is why we saw people taking to Twitter last week to say that every time they tried to buy a home, they met the same people who outbid them as they tried to buy up homes for international investors as part of these schemes.  If the Government is serious about this, it should exclude house purchasing from this programme immediately.<br\/><br\/>Another aspect of this is the vacancy created by some of these institutional investors.  Reports from RT&Eacute; show that in two developments belonging to Kennedy Wilson where rents are just under &euro;3,000 a month, at Clancy Quay in Dublin 8 and at Capital Dock, vacancy rates have been up to 50%.  With more than 8,000 people in emergency accommodation, including more than 2,000 children, these homes should be put to use and to do that, the owners would have to lower the rents.  It is imperative that the Government bring forward a fast and effective vacancy tax to prevent such vacancy from occurring.  It has completely failed on this issue.<br\/><br\/>The Government can do a huge amount to fix this problem.  It is doing a huge amount right now to encourage these international investments.  We need action on this issue quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100039#MM00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620757500,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for using its Private Members' time to raise this important issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has learned absolutely nothing from the disastrous mistakes that have led to the current housing crisis.  The two mistakes were the disastrous decision to invite in the vulture funds, cuckoo funds and speculators, particularly in 2013 and 2014, and the simultaneous and equally disastrous decision by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government to essentially stop the building of public housing directly by local authorities.  Fianna F&aacute;il started those mistakes when it set up NAMA and increasingly outsourced and cut back the provision of social housing.  However, Fine Gael and the Labour Party turned a bad situation into a disaster in 2013-14 with the two decisions to stop building council housing and to bring in the vulture funds with tax incentives, etc.  Those are the reasons.<\/p>  <p>  First, NAMA handed over more than &euro;40 billion worth of land and property assets to these vultures, giving them significant control over the market.  It gets worse, however, because these funds are now buying up new builds.  We are now being told that despite the disastrous situation these vultures have created, we cannot do without them.<\/p>  <p>  You only need to google the profits of some of these entities - anybody can do it - to see what enormous fortunes they have made.  The worse the housing crisis is, the more valuable their assets are, the more profits they make, the more rents they can charge, and the higher the prices of the properties they sell.  It is a simple equation.  While they control the market, they have no interest in solving the housing crisis.  This is the simple truth the Government does not understand.<\/p>  <p>  Now the Government wants to compound this disastrous situation by not only allowing these funds to have control of the private housing sector but to open up the public land bank to them with the Land Development Agency Bill that will go through next week.  I cannot ring the alarm bells enough for the public out there about what the Land Development Agency, LDA, is.  This is letting the fox into the hen house to plunder all of the public land bank.  The one thing that could dampen the market and counteract the influence of these people is for the State, on a large scale, to build its own stock of public and genuinely affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  I see the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, nod and then I look at the figures for 2020.  Last year, 269 council houses were built in the four local authority areas in Dublin where the crisis is most acute.  The figures in Galway, Cork and so on are similarly pathetic.<\/p> <p>In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown the number is zero.  Zero council houses were built.  A few were provided by AHBs and most of the rest were provided through HAP or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, that is, outsourced to these funds that are making a fortune.  The result is situations like that faced by residents in St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which has been going on for four years.  The property was sold by NAMA to Apollo Global Management, represented by PwC.  It was flipped on to Mill Street Projects Limited, which has made four attempts to evict the tenants.  Some tenants have been driven out while others - ordinary working people - are accused of over-holding and are facing homelessness.  The owners want to drive up the value of the property but what has the Government done to stop this?  It has done nothing.<\/p> <p> What we need is to start building public and affordable housing on public land.  We also need punitive taxes on vacant properties and vacant sites and rent controls.  We need to stop the tax breaks for these vultures and to completely exclude them from the housing market.  Were we to do those things, we could start to solve the housing disaster the Government's policies has created.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100040#NN00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620758100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this motion.  Fianna F&aacute;il's response to this crisis would be laughable if it was not so serious.  It was summed up in a tweet by Fianna F&aacute;il MEP, Billy Kelleher, who effectively pointed to what was happening in Maynooth and said \"something\" must be done but this is Fianna F&aacute;il's policy.  It is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policy to incentivise the vulture and cuckoo funds to come in here.  Now that the chickens are coming home to roost, the approach of Fianna F&aacute;il is to wring its hands and say that something must be done while simultaneously not doing what obviously needs to be done in terms of excluding these funds from the housing sector.

No wonder he would not evict the vultures; he is one himself.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, the housing crisis comes down to a very simple question, namely, which side are you on?  Are you on the side of those struggling to pay rising rents or the corporate landlords making a killing with unprecedented income?

Are you on the side of the half a million young people still stuck at home or of the developers who are making massive profits?

It gave them what they wanted on the rent roll and on stamp duty.  Last week the Government said it was going to sort it out but it has not been sorted out yet.  It is not a question of clipping the wings of the vulture funds; we want them driven out of the nest, out of the housing market.  We need housing for people, not housing for profit.  The Government must reverse all of those tax breaks as an immediate first step.<\/p>  <p>  There was some interesting commentary during the week.  One chap from County Kildare, who announced his intention to vote Sinn F&eacute;in at the next election, although he did not express too much confidence that it would fundamentally change things, said that he wanted a Government to support a policy of not lining the pockets of developers with crazy lease agreements.  He wanted a Government that would not put him in a position of choosing between paying some amateur clown's second mortgage or renting from a faceless institution, both insanely at a rate of between 120% to 150% of a typical mortgage on the same property.  A poster on Twitter today said that the really problematic joint for young people's mental health is the need for a joint income to get out of their parents' house.  A big conversation has started about this.  The Government says that housing is now its number one priority.  Housing has been the number one priority for a huge number of working people, especially young people, for quite some time.  They have more or less got their cards marked at this stage but they will watch this Government to determine which side it is on.  Unless the Government shows - I do not believe it will - that it is on the side of working people and young people rather than speculators and cuckoos, then the housing issue, which is a ticking time bomb, could actually blow this Government up.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100041#OO00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1620758100,"counter":263,"content":"<p>There were probably more avian analogies in those contributions than we have ever heard before.

His opinion concluded the regulator was and is acting <i>ultra vires.  <\/i>I put that to the regulator, from whom I received no response.  I am not alone in my view on the regulator's thoughts.  Senior counsel for Cork County Council, in judicial review proceedings, described the regulator's recommendation to the Minister as unlawful, flawed, irrational, of no legal effect and without jurisdiction.  <br\/><br\/>On the same subject, from which the Ceann Comhairle will be glad to hear I am moving on, last night on &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot;, we heard the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, talk about high-density developments and, in the same breath, about family homes of three or four bed semi-detached houses, probably with gardens.  Clearly, the Minister of State is asleep and has not read his own guidelines.  <br\/><br\/>The specific planning policy requirement, SPPR 4, which Mr. Justice Collins referred to as unimplementable, is a specific planning policy requirement - I want the Ministers to listen carefully - to &quot;avoid mono-type building typologies (e.g. two storey or own-door houses only)&quot;.  This is the policy of the compact, high-density development that is to apply to every town of more than 5,000 people.  Watching the Minister of State last night, it was as plain as a pikestaff he was not aware this SPPR 4 existed.  It makes no provision for three or four-bedroom homes.  Three or four-bedroom semi-detached homes of the type the Minister of State envisages can be developed in the range of 20 to 30 dwellings per hectare.  His policy provides for 35 to 50 and not less than 30, according to the regulator, so I do not envisage any three or four-bedroom semi-detached houses.<br\/><br\/>The Minister and the regulator refuse to allow local authorities to adopt planning policies to provide for family homes.  When will the Government wake up?  This regulator will have the policy enshrined in every county development plan before it realises what has happened.  The SPPR 4 must be abandoned.  It is clear the regulator is the fox in the fowl house of, what is now, Fianna F&aacute;il's housing policy.  The consequence of his interpretation of the Minister's guidelines will choke housing supply.  It will put an end to family homes, increase house prices and create the ghettos of tomorrow.  It is the policy that will create the tribunals of tomorrow.  <br\/><br\/>The regulator has refused to debate with me on national radio.  Being the cute fox he is, when he is challenged he recoils to his little office in Grangegorman, or probably a big office which is bigger than some of the houses he is proposing.<br\/><br\/>Who is regulating the regulator?  It would appear from his presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, he is the Steve Silvermint of planning.  He has come to save us from the darkest days of the planning tribunals.  I hope the Taoiseach will not be faced with the surprise that faced him in this House last week, when he realised the effect of the policies of this Government in real terms, in that county councils are taking long-term leases from cuckoo funds.<br\/><br\/>The Government needs to have an epiphany in relation to the planning regulator and deal with the red fox in the fowl house.

The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland has stated that 75% of the space above ground floor retail in Dublin is empty.  There are reasons all of that is happening.  When we are looking at policies or ways to get houses built and young people and first-time buyers housed, there is potential to do things quickly.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said previously, the help to buy scheme should be expanded to include first-time buyers of vacant properties in order that they can bring them back into use as homes, especially in our towns and villages.

Second, we will rejuvenate our towns and villages by bringing these houses back into use.  Third, we will reduce our CO2 emissions because we will have the foundations in, the walls built and the roofs on the houses.

The banks are making it extremely difficult for young people.<\/p> <p>I deal with young couples who are working diligently, have two wages coming in and have saved as much as they can but they are still being denied a mortgage.  That is not right.  It was easier to get on the property ladder many years ago when people had less money.  That is not right and does not make sense.  I ask the Minister to please take on board the merits of this argument and what we are trying to achieve here for young people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100042#PP00600","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620759300,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this very important motion.

First, there is the problem of getting planning permission and zoning.  They go through hell and high water to get planning permission.  The planning regulator is not being fair and is dezoning land.  In one instance a few years ago, Mick O'Connell, the best footballer that ever graced the fields of this country, got Killorglin Town Council to vote to zone a bit of land for him for a small number of houses.  The planning regulator did not even know where Valentia Island was but he insisted that Kerry County Council rescind that zoning and Mick O'Connell was stopped in his tracks.<\/p>  <p>  There are other issues, for example, the increase in material costs, as well as levies and taxes.  We have great local builders like Michael Jack Cronin, who has done great work in recent times.  The Government must go back to the traditional way of house building, which was to give the local authorities funds to build houses.  The Government is also blocking the tenant purchase scheme and stopping tenants from purchasing their houses, which they did traditionally over the years and there was nothing wrong with that.  Any house built since 2015 is not allowed to be bought out.  We should go back to that old system.

These funds are commonly referred to as either vulture funds, which tend to buy up distressed mortgages, or cuckoo funds, which are buying up new housing estates and apartments and of which every person in the country is now well aware.  If this matter were not so serious, one might be forgiven for finding it rather amusing, or even childish.  If Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are looking for someone to blame, they should look inwards for they are both to blame for this issue.  This crisis, which will likely worsen, is inextricably joined at the hip with the banking crisis of over a decade ago.  Let us not forget what is happening in our local towns and villages, where Bank of Ireland branches are closing, including one in Bantry and another in Dunmanway in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  Much has been made over the past week of the fact that global investment funds are buying up entire housing estates and apartment blocks in Ireland.  Such unethical activity is depriving families and young people of owning an affordable home and is driving up prices, on both the rental and purchase sides.  In my constituency, there are people trying to rent, buy a property or build a home but it is impossible.  Sadly, the same mistakes have been made every single day at Government level.<\/p>  <p>  Who are these investment funds?  Many US, EU and, increasingly, Chinese investment funds are investing in Ireland.  While investment should generally be welcomed, when that investment becomes number one in the world for tax evasion purposes, it should be questioned.  For instance, these funds have been given unique tax treatment.  They pay no tax and are given an array of special incentives by the Government.  It is like a loophole in the law. <\/p>  <p>  There is another very serious issue on which the State has to step in.  In Baltimore an individual is buying between 25 and 55 acres of rock on some hill, which is of no benefit to anybody, and then selling every acre on DoneDeal for &euro;5,000.  All sorts of unsociable people are purchasing a piece of rock for &euro;5,000 and turning up in a beautiful place like Baltimore.  I ask the State to intervene on that issue, which I will be taking up with the Minister.

The Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, Deputy John McGuinness, m&eacute; f&eacute;in and Senator David Norris, with the help of Edmund Honohan, the highly respected Master of the High Court, brought forward the Affordable Housing and Fair Mortgage Bill in 2018.  The skullduggery and blackguarding that went on inside Fianna F&aacute;il to nobble Deputy McGuinness and stop that Bill in its tracks, from the Taoiseach down, was nothing short of scandalous.<\/p>  <p>  It was said earlier that today is Se&aacute;n Lemass's 50th anniversary.

I thought Fianna F&aacute;il learned something from the housing crisis, the bust and the brown envelopes of the Celtic tiger.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is no longer here.  A blind man could see what is going on.  People talk about cuckoo funds.  A cuckoo used to live in Kilnacarriga in the purple heather.  It made a lovely sound.  It is an insult to call these funds after that wonderful bird, which is welcome to our shores every year.  The cuckoo funds are not welcome and nor are the vulture funds that came before them.<\/p>  <p>  This issue has been going on since the banking crisis, with people being turfed out of their homes down in the courts.  All through the pandemic, people were being evicted and homes were being taken off people.  Banks are now putting properties and farms up for sale on the web at midnight or 11 o'clock at night.  The first the owners know of it is when a neighbour sees it and rings them up, then it is gone and sold to a vulture fund.  This is a brazen sell-out of our people, who Dan Breen, Se&aacute;n Treacy, Se&aacute;n MacDermott and P&aacute;draig Pearse fought for.  The Government should be ashamed to claim to represent a democratic Ireland under this kind of watch.  It welcomes in all these gangsters and funds that are raping and plundering our country.  We kept Cromwell out of parts of Tipperary but now we cannot do this on our own, in this modern-day democracy.  We celebrate the centenary of independence this year.  My God, they are turning in their graves.  It is so sad.<\/p>  <p>  This is not rocket science.  Prices are spiralling for people who want to build their own houses.  The cost of insulation has spiralled because of the carbon tax the Government has imposed.  The Government does not have the foggiest idea.  This is criminal and Government members should be brought before the Nuremburg tribunals for destroying our people and driving them to suicide due to their mental and physical health issues.  Above all, the Government has had the cover of the famous plandemic for the last 13 months.  It thought it could extend it and hide everything behind it but now it is being found out because the foxes, bears and otters are inside the hen house and all the hens are being plucked.  The Government will be plucked too. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100043#QQ00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1620759300,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion, which I fully support.  I missed the beginning of the debate so I am not sure whether the Government is agreeing with the motion.  The Minister might clarify that.<\/p>  <p>  I am sick and tired of the mantra and ideology coming from both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, through the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach, that we are ideologues on this side of the House.  I have repeatedly said that I am a proud Galwegian and a practical, pragmatic politician.  Since the day I came into this House in February 2016, I have begged and implored, tabled motions with my colleagues and joined with other motions, to highlight the housing crisis.  We have appealed to the Government to have a referendum and place the right to housing in the Constitution because a home is a basic human right.  The most fundamental things required by people are shelter and security so that they can participate actively in a democracy.  Both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have repeatedly demonised us, laughed at us and placed us in a box - all inappropriately - to justify their housing programme, which is not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  In Galway, people have been on a waiting list for a house for 15 years.  I do not need to exaggerate because the figures speak for themselves.  Once, councillors could go with applicants to the city council and give them some hope, telling them that if they did their time on the list they would get a house in seven to ten years.  At least they could do that.<\/p> <p>Not alone is that chance gone, but now the council will not even facilitate us with a meeting.  That is now gone completely, and was gone well before the onset of Covid-19.  <br\/><br\/>We had a construction programme in Galway.  It is important to give a context because this crisis has not just arisen.  Someone referred to it as just becoming more focused lately.  This is a crisis which has been created by ongoing Government policy.  The policy was to stop building public housing and to hand over the process, lock, stock and barrel, to investment funds with various names to look after homes and provide them in any manner they saw fit.  That is what happened.<br\/><br\/>I spent 17 years of my life at local authority level.  We fought to make it more accountable.  We fought to get quarterly reports, which, in fairness, the management gave us.  It told us what the problem was, the solution and the construction programme.  From 2009 onwards, the category for housing construction was suspended.  That continued in 2009, 2010 and thereafter until April 2019 when the Government was forced to set up a task force.  I have begged and implored the Minister for access to the various letters and he has finally given them to me.  I would not call them reports.  I thank him for giving them to me and I have read them all.  I would have thought, however, that a task force, by its very nature, was a recognition that there was a problem, and that the nature of the problem would then be analysed and solutions devised.  What seems to have happened here, however, is that the task force is ongoing, with many meetings receiving many presentations.  However, that could have been done at council level.  What we wanted from a task force was an analysis of the problem.  The Minister does not have to agree with me but surely an analysis of the problem is the most basic requirement before we can deal with the solution.  <br\/><br\/>I will raise again the Simon Communities in Ireland report.  It regularly does a three-day snapshot.  In March 2021, its snapshot looked at 16 areas all over the country.  With regard to Galway, it found &quot;There was an average of 65 properties available to rent in Galway City Centre over the study period, similar to the 62 properties available in the December 2020 study&quot;.  Can we imagine that?  It also noted that only two properties fitted into at least one housing assistant payment, HAP, category.  This was &quot;the first time a property has been within a HAP limit in six study periods&quot;.  We will return to the HAP in a minute.  Even with the system in place, however, no houses are available under any of the categories in Galway, except one or two.  <br\/><br\/>All the details about Galway are here in the Simon Communities in Ireland report, Locked Out of the Market Study March 2021, in table 12 for Galway city centre and table 13 for Galway city suburbs.  I invite the Minister to look at those tables.  Before he makes comments again about those of us on this side of the House being ideologues, he might look at this report and make his comments relate to reality.  The reality is that we are down to one or two properties being available under the HAP limits in Galway city, and that has been repeatedly the case with these snapshot studies.  In addition, rents in Galway have gone up and up.  They came down a little in Dublin but have gone up by 4.6% in Galway city. <br\/><br\/>Some progress has been made, and I thank the task force and management in that regard.  It is not, however, progress of the type we need to sort out the housing crisis.  The State must be central to the policy.  Housing is not a commodity to be traded and given over to investment funds.  It is a basic human right.  That is where we differ.  People should be given choices of whether to buy or rent a house, depending on the different stages of their lives.  They should not be forced into a mortgage for any number of years to suit the ideology of the Government.  We should of course support and encourage people to purchase houses.  However, that should be done on a balanced basis, with the State building public housing for everyone to give them a choice and change the limits.<br\/><br\/>Fine Gael and the Labour Party brought in the HAP system in 2014 or thereabouts.  From that point onwards, the Government gave up any pretence of building houses.  Not alone did it do that but anyone who went on to the HAP was taken off the housing waiting list.  I spent much of my time arguing over this point.  I was told I was a liar.  I have pointed out in the past that, no, I was a lawyer at that point and while there might be some overlap between liars and lawyers, I was not lying.  That was the type of idiocy we had to go through because of the policy on HAP, where the Government wanted to hide the fact that people came off the housing waiting list.<br\/><br\/>From the Committee of Public Accounts, we knew that HAP payments were rising.  My colleagues and I were laughed at when we said that the Government was bolstering the market.  When I looked at the report from the task force, I found out that the average top-up payment in Galway is &euro;56 per week from the tenant.  That is the average top-up.  These used to be hidden, under-the-counter payments.  Now, they are over-the-counter payments.  Rent for a two-bedroom house in my area in Galway city is &euro;2,000.  It is nothing short of scandalous.  <br\/><br\/>What am I asking for?  I am not asking to argue.  I am not asking to roar and shout.  I am asking the Minister to recognise that there is a housing crisis and that the Government must be central to the solution by building public housing on public land.<br\/><br\/>In the minute and a bit left to me, I return to the situation in Galway.  I attended a presentation on the redevelopment of the harbour in the city recently and what is planned in that regard.  At least 17 acres are redundant to need and the land is now to be sold off to the highest bidder or a deal will be done with the Land Development Agency rather than hand over that land to the city council, when we have a housing crisis.  Ceannt Station is also being developed, and that is a developer-led project on fantastic land in the middle of the city.  There is no provision for social or public housing and no master plan for that site.  The university is developing a plan for another area, Nuns' Island, and the city council is undertaking work as part of the Dyke Road and Sandy Road regeneration plan as well.<br\/><br\/>We have land now.  The task force tells us it will run out in 2023.  In the meantime, what land we have we are allowing the harbour company to sell off to the highest bidder.  We are also allowing all the other developments to go ahead with no master plan, city architect, overall vision or recognition that public land is essential to the solution of our housing crisis.  I have repeatedly raised this issue, and I make no apology for doing so.  I will continue to raise it for as long as I have a voice in this D&aacute;il.  The Minister should not insult me and my colleagues by telling us we are ideologues because it twists language on its head.  The Government is the ideologue, and every policy it has pursued is for the market.  <br\/><br\/>In my last ten seconds, I finish with a quote from Dr. Michael Byrne of the school of social policy in UCD.  He points out regarding the Government's housing policy, that investment in the private rental market is &quot;a major new development in the Irish housing system, and one which is likely to shape how Irish cities develop in future&quot;.  He continues: &quot;<i>The Strategy for the Rental Sector <\/i>document (Department of Housing, 2016b: 17), for example, highlights the benefits of institutional provision of rental housing in terms of its capacity&quot;.  It then comes as a surprise to the Government that the investment funds are buying up estates and apartments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100043#QQ00500","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620759900,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chair for the opportunity to respond to the different points made, and, indeed, to respond to some of the charges made against the Government, my party and the Ministers working on responding to the great challenge we face.<\/p>  <p>  Let me begin by making it completely clear where this Government and I stand and where previous Governments have stood, and whose side we are on.  We are on the side of those seeking to be able to rent a home at an affordable price and those seeking to buy their first home at an affordable price.<\/p> <p>They are the people this Government is serving.  When the Government is looking at the right policies that need to be put in place to meet those needs, they are the people who we have at the centre of our planning and our thinking.<\/p> <p> That is not just a claim on behalf of me or the Government, it is matched by actions that we have taken and changes that have happened.  I can see it at first hand in my constituency in the lives of those who I serve and represent.  I know the challenges faced by those who look at how they are going to pay their rent every month, worry that the rent is going to increase in the future and wonder how they will ever be in a position whereby they will be able to set aside money for the deposit for a mortgage.  I know what it is like when I knock on the door of a home and meet people who have been on a Dublin City Council housing waiting list for years and are wondering when that new home is going to become available.  Equally, however, I know and can see the difference that policies have made, and will make again, to those households.<\/p> <p> I see homes currently being built in Dominick Street by the State.  It is being supported in the delivery of those homes, the purpose of which is to meet current needs, by city council.  I see the work that is under way at O'Devaney Gardens.  I see the commitment in respect of the redevelopment of St. Mary's Mansions and what has happened there.  That is not consistent with the rhetoric to the effect that this Government is not playing its role in meeting housing needs.  The homes to which I refer are being built on behalf of the State to meet the needs that are there, that are growing and that are the cause of such anxiety for so many.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage visited and opened the redeveloped St. Mary's Mansions.  I see the difference that project has made, at the very heart of the Dublin Central constituency, in Sean McDermott Street.  It was a project that for so long was a sign of how progress was not being made.  To see that project actually being delivered is not a sign of a State that is subcontracting out its responsibilities in the context of meeting housing needs in Ireland.  It is the sign of a State that is meeting those needs directly.  The previous Government sought to do it and this Government will continue to do it, and will find ways to do it more effectively.<\/p> <p> If that is the reality of what I see in the context of houses that are being built and needs that we must meet, and I know that we must meet many needs and do even more, it is also the case - and the figures are there - regarding homes that were being built before the pandemic hit.  There is also the intention that the Government has to directly build more homes this year.  I heard speaker after speaker this evening ask why the State is not playing a role and why it is not responding directly to the needs that exist.  In 2019, before the pandemic hit our country, more than 5,000 homes were built by the State in response to existing needs.  This year, despite all of the challenges that we are facing in opening up our construction sector, the closure of which was supported by many who have spoken this evening, the Government is still aiming to meet the demanding goal of delivering 9,500 homes, either directly or indirectly.  That is the reality of what is happening.  Even with all of the challenges we have faced and are facing in the context of Covid when it comes to reopening up our construction sector and getting it up and running again, it is still the case that the single biggest provider of homes in the country this year, either directly or indirectly, will be the Government.  I heard speaker after speaker ask where the Government is.  That is where the Government is.  The meeting of housing needs in this way this year, the commitments that have been made, the work that is being led by the Minister, supported by a housing budget of over &euro;3 billion to continue to build on this work and meet the needs that are there, is the sign of an active Government and the role that it is determined to play.<\/p> <p> To deal with the issue that is also lies at the core of this matter, namely, the role of institutional investors, the role they have to play and the debate that has taken place about that this evening in recent days, I highlight the following.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently published its housing demand needs analysis, which highlights the fact that 33,000 homes need to be delivered here.  The analysis makes the point that 18,400 of those homes will either need to be delivered through the private rental market or will need to be built by the private sector for people to buy and own.  Ours is a small economy, and one with two banks that will be active in the coming years in meeting the needs that exist.  If we do not have an economy that is big enough to meet, for example, the employment needs of our society - which is why there is a role for foreign direct investment within our country - and the need for a private sector that uses private capital to add to the efforts of the Government, then there is a role for large investors and pension funds to play in meeting those needs within the parameters of a legal and regulatory framework that is put in place by the Government.<\/p> <p> As the Minister indicated, and I want to reiterate this point, we are looking at measures that can be taken to deal with incidents such as that which happened recently and which was reported on last weekend.  I understand why this matter is of concern and how families feel when they worry that they will be priced out of the market and will not be able to buy a house and call it a home for life.  We understand that.  That is why the Government is looking at options in respect of how we can deal with this issue.  The Minister and I are working on that at the moment.  We will do that work and we will complete it.  For those who have made the charge this evening that the State should not allow these investors into our country, that they should play no part at all in meeting the needs that exist, there is a question that falls to them to answer.  If we want to make progress in dealing with the rental needs of a generation that needs more apartments at rents that are affordable, does the private sector have a role to play?  Is there a role at all for investors of scale to become landlords that are able to meet needs and provide rental accommodation in large numbers?  In the same way that we look to international investors to become involved in our economy, the State will set up a framework in which that can be done in this sector.  We will deal with, and look to make progress on, the issue that has been of such concern to so many and that has provoked and incited the need for the kind of debate we are having this evening and the motion that has been put forward.<\/p> <p> I will go back to where I began.  What is motivating this Government and all of its efforts, is meeting the housing needs that are there.  We know that they are growing.  We know how high is the level of anxiety among those who are renting and who are worried that their rent will go up or that they may not be able to own homes in the future.  The answer to dealing with much of that is in how we increase supply.  The Government will play our role in that regard.  We are playing our role through the scale of the housing budget that is in place.  We will continue to look at the framework that is in place and how it can be strengthened to channel in investment in such a way that it can meet the need for more homes.  That is the mission of this Government and it is what the Minister and I are working together to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100044#RR00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620760500,"counter":285,"content":"<p>It is very telling that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage spent far more time misrepresenting Sinn F&eacute;in housing policy than he did addressing the issue at hand.  What is remarkable about that is that when the Minister was in opposition, he was the arch-enemy of what he at that time called the cuckoo funds.  He tabled legislation which he said would clip their wings and he campaigned on an election manifesto which guaranteed action to ensure that no single buyer could purchase large numbers of homes that were not intended for the build-to-rent sector.<\/p> <p>Despite this staunch opposition to what he then called cuckoo funds, when the programme for Government was negotiated, there was not a single mention of the issue.  The Minister must have forgotten about it or else he decided the promises he made to get elected were no longer valuable.  The only reason the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, are even considering this matter now is the huge public anger at the failure of the Government to keep its word.  People do not want bluff and bluster.  They want action and they will judge the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, by what he does.<\/p> <p> With respect to the Minister for Finance, the difficulty is that by every single indicator from the beginning of the ten years of Fine Gael in government until now, the housing crisis is worse.  Homeless levels, rents and house prices are higher.  The Minister is right in one aspect.  If we are arguing that high-yield, short-term, speculative investment funds are the wrong kind of investment, then where will the money come from to build the homes?  It is a very reasonable question, although the Minister knows we have answered it repeatedly.  The first answer is that the State needs to do far more than it is doing.  Half of all the social and affordable homes that are required should be fully funded by the State.  The Government should do what the ESRI advised and double capital investment in public housing from &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;2.8 billion.  It also needs to start attracting the right kind of private sector investment, instead of investment that leads to rents in Dublin city centre of &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 and pushes house prices up to &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000.

Instead of clipping wings, as promised, he has given wings to the wealth funds.  This is the Red Bull Government.  A total of 135 homes were scooped out of 170 in a housing development in my constituency.  Fianna F&aacute;il promised to ring-fence a miserly 30% of homes for ordinary buyers and workers who keep our economy going.  In fact, the Minister gifted the investors 79% of the homes in Mullen Park.  He might as well have walked into that development and put up a big sign saying \"No mortgage holders need apply\".  Did we ever think we would see the day that people would need a war fund to buy a house, not in Monte Carlo but in Maynooth in County Kildare?  This is the Minister's doing.  His legacy is a housing market that is mutant and its priorities perverse.  The full pamper package is provided for investors but workers can go to hell.

Having a roof over our head is one of our most basic needs.  We must have a radical rethink of our official attitude to housing whereby a few privileged and pampered investors are deciding where many hard-working and unpampered young people can live.

Here is a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, himself an investor at the peak of the boom in regard to one of these REITs, talking about Sinn F&eacute;in and others in opposition engaging in slash and burn politics.  This is a Minister whose party's policies, as has been well established, fuelled the housing crisis.  Fianna F&aacute;il's policies in the aftermath of the financial crisis slashed and burned the incomes of people right across the State and, unfortunately, left many people with no option but to emigrate from the country in which they were born.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister lectures Sinn F&eacute;in without coming forward with any proposal of his own.  He took issue with our opposing the shared equity scheme.  Let me point out that we are very proud to oppose that scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100046#TT00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1620761100,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The Deputy and his party oppose everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100046#TT00400","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1620761100,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I will explain it to him in case he does not understand.  The reason we oppose the shared equity scheme is very simple.  We believe it risks increasing house prices for people who are already locked out of the market.  The Minister need not take our word for it.  The Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the ESRI and the Central Bank have all warned him about the scheme.  He can do his amused thing all he wants but people are suffering as a result of the policies of his party and Fine Gael.  He might think it is a game in here but it is no game for people who are paying sky-high rents and are locked out of the property market.<\/p>  <p>  One would swear that butter would not melt in the mouth of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and all he wants to do is make sure people have a home.  Since 2016, I have been telling and warning him that the experiment with REITs and IREFs in this country has failed.  I told him that they are squeezing out first-time buyers and those who want to purchase their own home.  I told him they are dominating the market, particularly in Dublin.  In 2019, six out of every ten new homes that were sold in Dublin did not even come onto the market.  The funds snatched them up and the Minister knows damn well why.  They did so because he has created a tax-free environment that incentivises this type of investment and ownership.  Those same funds then charge sky-high rents.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is adamant its strategy is right but it is running around like a headless chicken.  What happened in Maynooth was a lightning rod for the people of this State, who are very angry that rents are so high.  They are angry that their sons and daughters are locked out of home ownership.  They are angry that there is no chance of any ordinary person owning a property in Dublin or, indeed, the commuter belt.  They are angry that the policies of the Government are fuelling this scenario and that it has encouraged and rolled out the red carpet for the vulture funds that are benefiting from and profiting off this situation.  Mullen Park was the lightning rod but what happened there has been going on for ages in different estates.  The Minister is trying to convince us that we need this type of investment to ensure developers can build estates.  He is conflating two different issues.  Private rental sales do not fund developments.  These funds give no money to the developer to finance building.  All they do is purchase the properties after they are built and pay for them at that stage.  The developer gets the money from international finance, the banks and other sources.  There is no issue with that.  It is not the private rental sales that fund these developments.  All they do is come in at an early stage and say they will buy the properties from the developer when they are finished, and they pay up when the properties are completed.<\/p>  <p>  That has been happening right across the board, not just in the case of Mullen Park in Maynooth a couple of weeks ago.  In 2019, there were 2,909 new homes sold in private rental sales, mainly to these funds, as well as 3,039 second-hand homes.  Where was the Minister's outrage in regard to the XVI portfolio that saw 765 homes sold to IRES REIT in 2019?  What about the Vert project that saw 385 homes in Leopardstown sold to funds in June the same year?  Also in 2019, 370 homes were sold to the funds under Project Turner.  In Heuston South Quarter, 266 homes were snatched up by the funds in the same year, locking out first-time buyers, and another 222 homes were sold under the Belgrave Collection.  I could go on to name 42 other transactions totalling 5,700 homes bought up by the funds in 2019 alone.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is not just that these funds are buying up properties.  They are pushing up the price of a home by paying more than &euro;80,000 above market price, thereby creating a new ceiling and locking out people.  The Minister thinks this is okay because, somehow, &euro;450,000 is an affordable price to pay for a house.  He is living in cloud cuckoo land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100046#TT00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1620761100,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The Deputy is over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100046#TT00600","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1620761100,"counter":292,"content":"<p>We have been putting forward the proposals set out in this motion year after year in the debate on the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party voted against even looking at the idea of additional stamp duty on these types of funds just six months ago.

What has been happening in Tigray is quite shocking.  I remain deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict, which has seen many people killed, injured and displaced, and which is feeding into instability across the Horn of Africa.<\/p>  <p>  Since joining the UN Security Council, Ireland has worked consistently to ensure a focus on the conflict in Ethiopia, initiating discussions at the Council in February and March, and leading negotiations that led to the adoption of a press statement on the situation in Tigray on 22 April, the first time the Council has spoken publicly on the crisis.  We will work to ensure the Council maintains its focus on this pressing issue.<\/p>  <p>  An immediate ceasefire is the most important step all parties can take.  In this regard, it is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.

My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has so far provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the vital humanitarian response on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  There are multiple credible and harrowing reports of ongoing human rights violations, including, in particular, sexual violence being used as a tool of war in Tigray.  I strongly support the work of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, working with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, to investigate reported atrocities.  I continue to engage with a range of key interlocutors in the region and the African Union.  There is significant Gulf engagement in the Horn of Africa and I have discussed the situation in Tigray with the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is also engaging with the Gulf states on the situation.  Finland&rsquo;s foreign minister has visited the region twice on behalf of the EU, including visits to Saudi Arabia and the UAE which examined the ways in which Gulf countries can play a constructive role in addressing the Tigray crisis.

We see the situation with Eritrea.  For the first time on 23 April, there was acknowledgement that Eritrea had troops within the Tigray region.  A commitment was made to start withdrawing those troops but that has not happened.  I have had a briefing from the former Ethiopian minister for foreign affairs, Berhane Gebre-Christos.  He has said that the Eritrean area is being used by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to fly drones into the Tigray area, which has been integral to, and instrumental in, the destruction that has added to the humanitarian crisis and the number of deaths in the area.

We did the latter.  The statement was strong, particularly on sexual violence, the need for an independent investigation and the need for humanitarian access to all of the Tigray region, which has been hugely problematic.  We could not get a clear wording on the need for Eritrean troops to leave into the statement but I, separately, have been publicly vocal on that matter, as has the European Union.  We are continuing to work with our colleagues in the European Union to keep the Ethiopian Government in the spotlight in order to ensure it does everything that is appropriate on this issue.  Most importantly, we must continue to advocate at all levels for a ceasefire across the board and for a full, independent investigation so we can hold to account the people who have committed crimes against humanity.

That is part of the story that we cannot ignore, of course.  There is a broader story as well in terms of what has driven the tension that has resulted in this cycle of violence and how we respond to that.

The exchange with the presidential special envoy, Mr. Kerry, focused on preparations for COP26 and measures that must be taken to ensure success, including bringing along least-developed countries and small island developing states.<\/p>  <p>  My contribution on behalf of Ireland was to focus on the practical co-operation required between the EU and the US in a number of areas.  These include climate finance, as we must spend more money and commit more financial resources to climate finance, particularly around adaptation for developing countries, small island developing states and countries that desperately need to invest in infrastructure to adapt to the new realities they are facing on the basis of climate change that is already happening.  That is as well as planning for further change in future, whether it arises from desertification, more violent storms in places like the Caribbean or flood risk to small island states in the south Pacific.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Kerry agreed on much of that.  The other area on which I would like to do more work concerns the oceans.  We cannot have a credible global climate action agenda without a very serious discussion around oceans from a mitigation and adaptation perspective.  The area on which we focused most in terms of transatlantic co-operation, and where we got a very good response from Mr. Kerry, was funding for climate adaptation and resilience.  There is much focus on mitigation and potentially not enough focus on adaptation and resilience.

The Minister is acutely aware of this, having an airport in his constituency.  Once we have an open and common travel area with the United Kingdom, it is simply senseless if planes are taking off from North America and coming into the United Kingdom for us to not allow planes to go from Ireland to North America.

We are closely following the situation, including on reports of systemic abuse, torture, arbitrary detention, forced labour, forced sterilisations and restrictions on freedom of religion and belief.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the situation and under the EU global human rights sanctions regime, the EU adopted sanctions on 22 March 2021 against one entity and four individuals in China due to their involvement in human rights abuses in Xinjiang.  The EU global human rights sanctions regime allows the EU to target serious human rights violations and abuses by state and non-state actors worldwide.  It enables the EU to respond rapidly and in a more tangible and direct way to human rights, one of the fundamental values of EU foreign policy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU raise our concerns with Chinese authorities in both bilateral and multilateral contexts.  Over the course of 2020, the EU raised its concerns regarding the human rights situation in China with Chinese authorities during its high-level engagements at the EU-China summit and the EU-China leaders' meeting.  More recently, Ireland raised concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang in our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council in March this year.  Prior to this, we also reiterated our concerns in our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council in September last year, which urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Ireland has also supported a number of joint initiatives in the UN system.  We joined a statement at the UN third committee on 6 October 2020 that reiterates our grave concern regarding the situation in Xinjiang, and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN special procedures mandate holders.  This letter called on China to respect human rights and to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach on the UN Security Council is informed by our record as a country with a consistent, principled and independent foreign policy.  We put forward our perspectives on all issues on the UN Security Council agenda, and engage with and listen carefully to the views of all UN Security Council members, including China.<\/p> <p>Although the treatment of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang is not on the UN Security Council agenda, the Government will continue to monitor and assess the situation and engage with the Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora, as we have been doing to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100052#ZZ01200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620765300,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

Ireland follows the practice of recognising genocide where this has been established by a judgment of an international court where there is international consensus on the matter.

In my opinion, such resolutions have mainly served to harden attitudes on the Chinese side but have not improved the situation for the Uighur population.

With regard to the issue of how we define it legally, certainly the advice I have from the Department is that we do not have sufficient legal certainty to be able to categorise it as genocide.

To call something genocide is a very serious accusation and we need to be able to back it up in terms of the legal consequences of the term.

I have to say from what I saw there - we were fairly robust in our conversations with the UN agencies that were there - that there is a very transparent process of ensuring that what should be crossing in to Idlib for humanitarian reasons is what is crossing in.  The focus now has to be to try to manage the politics of this in the context of the politics of Syria on the UN Security Council, which is about as divisive as it gets, to try to find a way of ensuring this crossing stays open.

The alternative to having a UN-monitored, UN-managed and transparent crossing where huge volumes of humanitarian assistance can be brought to close to 3 million people is to have unaccountable border crossings where sporadic aid will get in, but with such levels of aid certainly not being anything like sufficient to deal with the numbers who need it.  In such circumstances, one will see mass movement of people - some of them coming across the border into Turkey - and all the tensions that will cause.  From a humanitarian point of view, we will be appealing to all of the countries that are involved in this process to find a way of agreeing a resolution that can allow this aid to continue to flow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100054#BBB00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Historical Conflicts","time":1620765900,"counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100054#BBB00350"},{"type":"question","time":1620765900,"counter":398,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[24131\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100054#BBB00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the Government will formally recognise that genocide was committed against the people of Armenia during World War 1 by the Ottoman Turkish Government.

In December 1948, the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide described genocide as carrying out acts intended \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".  The dispute about whether these events were genocide centres on the question of premeditation - on the degree to which the killings were orchestrated.  Some histories believe that in this case they were but there are many who offer the other argument also.  The 1948 UN Convention sets out a clear definition of genocide and the legal process to be followed if disputes arise.  There has been no ruling in regard to this matter by an international court and neither the EU nor the UN has recognised these events as genocide.

In fairness, there is no country today that represents the Ottoman Empire of the past and nobody is suggesting that a country should be held liable.  However, if acts of genocide happened in the previous century, no matter how far back, it is important that we as a State face up to our responsibility to assess it and figure out whether it was genocide.  We should look at it again.

The Stormont House Agreement framework was reached collectively by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations.  To be completely accurate, the UUP did not support it but the other parties did.  It is vital that we make progress on this for the victims and families who have been waiting for so long and for society as a whole, as we seek to build deeper reconciliation.  The Government has continued to engage on this issue since the Stormont House Agreement was reached in 2014 and to work for that important progress.  We want to see the agreement implemented.<\/p>  <p>  In March of last year, the UK Government issued a written ministerial statement that proposed to significantly depart from the Stormont House Agreement.  Since then, I have spoken regularly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to express our strong concerns and to reiterate the importance of a collective approach consistent with the Stormont House Agreement, and one which is compliant with international human rights obligations.  I reaffirmed those critical principles to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when we met last week in Dublin and strongly advised him against any unilateral action on these very sensitive issues.<\/p>  <p>  Media reports last week of possible plans to introduce a statute of limitations have caused significant upset, shock and concern in Northern Ireland.  In my time as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have met with many victims and survivors from both communities.  I know how hurt they are at the idea of being denied a route to pursue justice on behalf of their loved ones. <\/p>  <p>  As per the Stormont House Agreement framework, there is a need to take a comprehensive view of how to achieve progress and reconciliation for society as a whole but the needs of victims and families must be at the heart of the process.  <\/p>  <p>  I join Deputy Smith in welcoming the report released today on the Ballymurphy massacre.  I have had the privilege of meeting the families who have been involved in decades of campaigning for justice.

I very much welcome and do not doubt the Government's commitment to dealing with legacy issues but the British Government must be equally committed, which has not been the case so far, unfortunately.  The Minister used the phrases \"strong concern\" and \"critical principles\" and referred to the unacceptability of unilateral action by the British Government.

I mentioned that there was an agreed motion on the Ballymurphy massacre and he will recall that there were also agreed motions on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 2008, 2011 and 2016.

It is very appropriate and I thank the Minister for being in the House to reply.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past year, in particular, when the global community has been preoccupied with the fight against Covid-19, it is quite understandable that issues of a human-rights nature and atrocities, which take place under various headings throughout the globe, have to some extent gone unnoticed.  They were certainly not noticed to the extent they would otherwise have been.  It is important that Ireland uses its position as a member of the UN Security Council to highlight locations throughout the globe where these atrocities are taking place.  They take place on a daily and hourly basis, and even as we speak, they continue.  Reference was made during Question Time to the situations in Sudan, Ethiopia and throughout Africa and to the atrocities various organisations visit on helpless, poor and humble communities regularly.<\/p>  <p>  Atrocities against women were referred to during the previous debate and I want to emphasise that point again.  These atrocities continue with greater ferocity and rapidity, and the number of incidents increases daily.  Rape and sexual abuse seem to be more commonplace than they ever were.  The Minister acknowledged rape has always happened during the course of a war, much to our chagrin.  I hope this is being taken into account and that decisions will be made in the UN which will overhaul the activities of the perpetrators in these situations.<\/p>  <p>  I have only a short amount of time to refer to the ongoing difficulties in China, which were mentioned by other Members during Question Time, in Myanmar, which continue, and in other locations throughout the globe.  These atrocities seem to continue with impunity because there is a belief among the perpetrators that there will be no response, and that there can be no response.  They seek the use of the time available to them to do so under cover of other tragedies.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister, even if it means standing out and being different from everybody else, that we use the position we now have on the UN Security Council to highlight these atrocities, to bring public and international attention to them, and to make it clear that there is a way of punishing these people and that punishment will be meted out.  By doing so, nobody will presume that they can pursue such atrocities with impunity.  The International Criminal Court and the war crimes tribunals were referenced in the previous debate.  It is imperative that this is done as a matter of urgency so as to give ample warning to the perpetrators of the kinds of atrocities spoken about over the last hour and a half in this House.  They will continue unless something really dramatic is done, that is, to let it be known that there will be retribution and that it will be swift and severe.

Today marks the tenth anniversary of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, sometimes known as the Istanbul Convention.  It is a timely reminder of the impact of Covid-19, particularly regarding the increasing incidences of domestic violence against women during the pandemic.  As Deputy Durkan is aware, women are to the fore in providing healthcare and support for those affected by the pandemic.  Furthermore, in many countries, the economic downturn and closure of schools means that many girls are not returning to education, which undermines decades of progress in human rights and sustainable development goals.  I am also very conscious that access to human-rights monitors, from the UN to civil society organisations, are severely curtailed because of the travel and other restrictions during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been very active in promoting and protecting human rights at the United Nations through our current membership of the UN Security Council, the Human Rights Council in Geneva and the Third Committee of the General Assembly.  Deputy Durkan will be aware that Ireland took up its seat on the UN Security Council on 1 January.  Since then, we have been working across the full council agenda, which includes some 30 country and 20 thematic files.  Promoting respect for human rights, accountability, and compliance with international law is central to our efforts.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, for example, we addressed the issues in Myanmar and Ethiopia.

We are also active at the Human Rights Council and support the work of the UN Secretary General and his special envoy on Myanmar.<\/p>  <p>  On Ethiopia, Ireland has been very proactive in encouraging the council to focus on this crisis.  We initiated council discussions on the deeply concerning humanitarian situation in Tigray in February and March.  We led negotiations on a press statement on Ethiopia, which was adopted by the council on 22 April.  This was the first time the council spoke publicly on the situation there.  The statement called for unfettered humanitarian access in Tigray and expressed deep concern about human rights violations and, in particular, sexual violence against women and girls.  We have raised concerns about human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in a wide range of other contexts.  We will continue to do so throughout the term on the council.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly across the UN system, Ireland is a strong supporter of the work of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, who I have met on a number of occasions - in February and in March - at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We delivered more than 20 statements on thematic and country-specific human rights situations including Myanmar, Syria, Iran, Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Israel, and the occupied Palestinian territory.<\/p> <p>As I will be speaking immediately after this debate about the issue of Israel and Palestine, I will not cover that now.  I am, however, very concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and will speak about that in more detail.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that I confirmed this evening that the UN Security Council will be discussing the deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian situation in a closed session tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100056#DDD00600","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620767700,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I ask that he utilise Ireland's position and his own to pursue the issues to which he has just referred in a way that makes it clear to the perpetrators that there is an end to all this, that there is retribution and that there will be justice for the victims in these cases.  I did not refer to the antics of Boko Haram in Nigeria and the surrounding areas or the human rights abuses in China, but obviously we are well aware of them and the Minister himself referred to the latter.  There are similar cases in other countries, some of which would claim to be democracies.  Let us not forget the opposition leaders who are confined to prison as a result of speaking out.  The erosion of democracy has continued in an alarming way, over the past 12 months in particular.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister is committed to this issue but measures must be prioritised within the UN and the EU with a view to ensuring all such perpetrators recognise that, as and from now, there will be retribution and they will have to account for their activities.  Previous similar perpetrators have ended up with long prison sentences from the courts in The Hague and there is this distinct possibility that they must go that route as well.

The challenge, of course, is in being effective and not just saying the right things but actually being an agent for change in countries that are often a long way from here and from Europe.  That is the real challenge.  We must work out how to use Ireland's position within the European Union, the UN and the Security Council, as well as the bilateral relationships we have with both big and small countries, to advocate for and protect human rights for vulnerable populations, of which there are many.  As a reminder of just how many vulnerable populations exist, there are currently 75 million displaced people living in refugee camps.<\/p>  <p>  The last time Ireland was on the Security Council, it was looking at 12 or 13 files.  There are now 30, so that number has increased almost threefold.

As I stated earlier, the report is a lengthy and complex document and it is being reviewed by officials in my Department.  Human Rights Watch is a respected NGO, and I value the role it and other civil society organisations referred to by Deputies, such as B'Tselem and Yesh Din, play.  <br\/><br\/>There is no doubt that Israel's actions have violated Palestinian human rights.  Israeli policy and practices, which discriminate against Palestinians, result in unequal and unfair treatment.  More broadly, unilateral actions have undermined trust between Israel and Palestinians, which in turn undermines the viability of a two-state solution.  That in my view is the only permanent, sustainable solution.  I am deeply concerned by the violence of recent days in East Jerusalem.  I condemn the launch of rockets from Gaza into Israel and the aggressive and disproportionate response by the Israeli Defence Forces in their attack on Gaza.  These events are terrifying for civilians on both sides, and deeply tragic for the families who have lost loved ones or whose relatives have been injured.  The number of child casualties is particularly shocking.  Civilians on both sides deserve much better.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned earlier in replying to questions, I met the Israeli ambassador this afternoon and conveyed my concerns to him in the strongest terms.  In response to the escalating violence in East Jerusalem, Ireland yesterday co-sponsored a meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the situation.  At that closed meeting, we underlined that the Israeli actions in East Jerusalem and at the Al-Aqsa compound were not acceptable and were provocative and we called for Israel to comply with international law.  The provocations and clashes in East Jerusalem, which led to many injuries at the holy site of Haram al-Sharif, or Temple Mount, are deeply worrying.  <br\/><br\/>The approach of the Israeli authorities and security forces is not acceptable, and Israel must comply with international humanitarian law.  Peaceful worshippers must be allowed to exercise their right to freedom of religion and to worship freely and without threats, violence or provocation in accordance with the <i>status quo<\/i>, especially during the holy month of Ramadan.  The right to peaceful protest must be upheld for all, and the Israeli security forces must be held accountable for any acts against peaceful protesters.  Ireland made these points in yesterday&rsquo;s Security Council discussion.  We will obviously also be participating very actively in tomorrow&rsquo;s discussion, because things have developed significantly since yesterday.<br\/><br\/>I echo calls for all parties to refrain from violence and provocative acts, including the firing of rockets and incendiary devices from Gaza into Israel.  I also raised the matter at the EU Foreign Affairs Council yesterday.  I expressed my deep concern at the violence and threatened evictions in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.  The increase in evictions and demolitions across the occupied Palestinian territories is alarming and is no doubt contributing significantly to tension on the ground.  Members will know I have been forthright in expressing my concerns regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  Ireland&rsquo;s position on this issue is and will continue to be based on international law and Israel&rsquo;s obligations as the occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention and the relevant resolutions passed in recent decades by the UN Security Council.  Ireland has repeatedly made its position known at the Security Council, where the issue is discussed each month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100057#EEE00900","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620768300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100058#FFF00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1620768300,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Finally, our approach is rooted in the illegality of Israel&rsquo;s occupation and the right of Palestinians to self-determination.

In that regard, a home is so important for people, and there is the saying that your home is your castle.  In that context, I raise the qualifying thresholds for social housing, which are too low, especially in my area of Carlow.  A review is being done, and I am here to ask the Minister of State about the status of that review.  I would also like to know if we are looking at those thresholds realistically.<\/p> <p>Ten years have passed since the latest review of income thresholds to qualify for the housing list.  I recall, as a Senator, speaking with the Minister of State, Deputy English, at the time and then it was said that a housing review was being undertaken.  <\/p> <p> It is unacceptable that we have been waiting on this review for ten years.  I believe that this is resulting in the exclusion of genuine people who should qualify for social housing.  It is unacceptable that people who are trying to work and make ends meet are being told that they do not qualify for the housing waiting list.  I have consistently raised the issue and have been told that it is being looked at.  People in County Carlow are caught in limbo because they do not qualify under the social housing income threshold but they do not earn enough to afford a mortgage.  There they are caught again.  When one is not on the housing list, one does not qualify for HAP.  For example, if someone is paying rent for accommodation of &euro;12,000 or perhaps &euro;13,000 per month - and rents in Carlow have soared in the past few years - he or she cannot save for a mortgage.  <\/p> <p> The Housing Agency Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2020, which was published earlier this year, states that the number of households in County Carlow that qualified for social housing supports by the local authority in 2020 was just 505, down from 519 in 2019, which is not a true reflection of the number of households that need social housing there, at least not if I can judge it from the conversations I have with people.<\/p> <p> The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 set the maximum net income limits for each local authority in different bands according to area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.  There is an urgent need to finalise the review of these limits and to increase the income eligibility limit for social housing in County Carlow and most likely in other counties.  Carlow currently has one of the lowest income thresholds in the entire country.  The maximum net income for a single person is &euro;25,000; for a couple with no children, it is &euro;26,250; for one adult with one child, it is &euro;25,625; for two adults with one child it is &euro;26,875; and for two adults with more than one child, it is &euro;27,500.  This compares to a limit of &euro;38,000 in County Kildare for two adults with one child and &euro;39,000 for two adults with more than one child.  Not only is it unrealistic to have such a marked difference between counties, the limits are a disincentive for opportunities that will increase household income.<\/p> <p> The idea of welfare is to help people get on their feet, not to cut them to knees to qualify for unrealistic caps.  That a difference in approximately &euro;11,000 exists in income thresholds between counties Kildare and Carlow is unacceptable.  The Minister of State is from the same area as me.  The difference in income thresholds between counties Carlow and Kilkenny is &euro;6,500.  That is not right.  Unless a person is on the local authority housing list, he or she will not get HAP, so the income threshold needs to be increased.  We must ensure that this is done.<\/p> <p> It is most important that action is taken on this issue.  It is unacceptable.  Everyone has seen hard times, but it is more important than ever that we give families the chance to qualify to go on the local authority housing list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100058#FFF02300","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620768900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that this is an issue that affects my own constituency as well as 14 other local authorities in the country.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.  The 2011 regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in three different bands according to the area concerned.  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%, and separately an additional allowance of 2.5% for each child.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the limits introduced also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area has commenced.  The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, clearly lays out our commitment to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system.  The Government approved priority drafting of the affordable housing Bill 2020 on 22 December 2020, the general scheme of which was published on 20 January 2021.  The Bill includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government's commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes and the introduction of a new form of tenure in cost rental.  The Bill was approved by Government last week and it is intended to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas in the very near future to allow for the commencement of the scheme this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100059#GGG00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1620768900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>It is very worrying that ten years have passed and there is still no date for the completion of the review.  I really worry about that.<\/p>  <p>  I do understand the new initiatives that have been introduced by the Government.  I will provide the Minister of State of the example of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  First-time buyers can apply for a Rebuilding Ireland home loan to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home.  They can borrow up to 90% of the market value of the property.  The maximum market value for properties in County Carlow is approximately &euro;250,000.  However, this year, just one Government-backed mortgage has been approved for a first-time buyer in County Carlow, out of four applications.  I have seen the figures in other counties and the refusals are worrying.<\/p>  <p>  Are the criteria right?  Why is it that out of four applicants in County Carlow, one was approved?  We are here promoting Rebuilding Ireland home loans.  I am worried about this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise another concern.  We all want to make sure that people can buy their own homes, and homes that are affordable.  In particular, we want to ensure that those who do not qualify for the housing list are in the position to buy their own homes.  We must ensure that the programme for Government enables people to buy affordable houses that are actually affordable.  It is the same with the shared equity scheme.  It is most important that we give the younger generation that opportunity to own their own homes.  We have seen this past week the concerns raised about funds buying large housing estates.  We cannot allow that to happen.  We must ensure that the young people get the chance to benefit from affordable housing and shared equity schemes and can get on the local authority housing list.  We must ensure that we get this right.<\/p>  <p>  I know that there are some good initiatives coming up in the programme for Government and I welcome that, but we must ensure that there are no obstacles in the way and that we get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100059#GGG00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1620768900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>As I have stated, affordability is at the heart of Government policy in the programme for Government.

It is most disappointing that the Minister for Health is not present to take it, given that it concerns a health issue in Arklow in our constituency.  I am disappointed and frustrated that he is not here to answer this question for the people of south Wicklow.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 February 2021, the Minister for Health announced that a number of vaccination centres were going to be set up across the country.<\/p> <p>Two of them were to be in County Wicklow, with one located in Greystones and the other in the Arklow Bay Hotel.  The centre in Greystones has been operating for approximately five weeks.  It has been offering some children's vaccinations and giving Covid vaccination appointments for three weeks' time.  The centre in the Arklow Bay Hotel was to open on 11 May, which is today.  Until now, people from Gorey, Arklow, Tinahely and throughout south Wicklow were travelling to Greystones to get their Covid vaccinations, while people from Greystones had to travel to Dublin.  The plan was that the centre in the Arklow Bay Hotel would open today and people from south Wicklow and north County Wexford would access vaccinations there instead of having to travel to the north of County Wicklow.<\/p> <p> As it transpired, the vaccination centre in Arklow did not open today.  We have a situation where the Arklow Bay Hotel was contracted for a three-month period to provide vaccinations but now it seems it will not open and there will be a grand total of zero Covid vaccinations given there.<\/p> <p> I have three questions for the Minister of State in this regard.  First, how did this situation arise?  Only last week, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, was in Arklow to avail of a photo opportunity in the hotel.  The story was all over the local newspapers.  How are we in a situation where, less than one week later, the vaccination centre is not open, there was apparently no preparation for it to open, no one was told what was happening and we only found out today it is not opening?  Second, what is the plan B for the residents of south Wicklow and north Wexford?  Third, what will happen to people in the interim while a plan B is put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100059#GGG00800","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620769500,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to update the House on the roll-out of the Covid-19 immunisation programme and vaccination centres.  The vaccine programme is a key enabler of the reopening of society and the economy.  It continues to progress, with more than 1.8 million doses administered overall.  The programme has passed the milestone of the administration of 500,000 second doses and, this week, we expect to pass the milestones of having administered 1.5 million first doses and 2 million total doses.  The plan is to distribute in the region of 250,000 to 270,000 vaccines to the system this week.  Vaccines will go to GPs, hospital groups and vaccination centres.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 38 HSE vaccination centres will operate on an eight-hour basis, seven days a week.  This will increase to 12 hours a day when supply allows.  These centres support the vaccination of the general population in a safe and efficient manner.  Each centre varies in size and operating hours and has been selected based on population density, ease of access, transport and parking.  There is at least one vaccination centre for each county.  As of 5 May, there were 35 HSE vaccination centres open and operating.  The 36th centre, in Carrick-on-Shannon, is planned to open on 12 May.  There has been very positive feedback from members of the public who have accessed vaccination appointments in their local HSE vaccination centres in the past week.<\/p>  <p>  The Arklow Bay Hotel Covid-19 vaccination centre was scheduled to open for the administration of vaccinations today.  However, following last week's announcement on the reopening of services, the hotel has indicated it will return to operating as a hotel business.  The result is that the facility will only be available to the HSE until the end of May.  From a logistical perspective, it does not make sense to operate a Covid-19 vaccination centre at the facility for the short time involved.  The HSE is actively exploring available alternative sites for a vaccination centre in the south Wicklow-north Wexford area.  A number of sites are being examined by HSE Estates and Community Healthcare East, in partnership with South East Community Healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  Pending agreement on a south Wicklow-north Wexford site, the HSE is maximising the capacity at the Aviva and Greystones vaccination centres.  As staff numbers increase in the Aviva facility, the number of available appointments will rise by an additional 400 to a total of 3,000 daily when all 29 booths are open.  The vaccination capacity at the Shoreline Greystones centre will be increased by moving from a 12-booth to a 15-booth model.  The change to the physical infrastructure at the Greystones site is already complete.  As more staff come on stream, the hours of operation will be extended to 12 hours per day.  This will allow a total of 1,400 appointments to be offered daily.  People in the Arklow area who are registered on the public portal will be offered appointments at the Shoreline centre in Greystones.  Those in the north Wicklow area will be offered appointments in the Aviva centre.  This has been the approach in recent week while awaiting the full opening of the Arklow Bay Hotel centre.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the efforts and flexibility of the HSE staff in ensuring the success to date of the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  I thank them for their continued commitment to the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100060#HHH00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1620769500,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I recognise this matter is not part of the Minister of State's remit and he has been left to explain this particular failing in the system.  However, some of his response does not make sense.  He stated the centre at the Arklow Bay Hotel was to open today but, because there are only three weeks left before the hotel returns to its usual business, it does not make logistical sense to have it operating for that period.  I do not understand why the HSE is not using that particular facility for the next three weeks.  The staff in Arklow were ready to go and had to be stood down.  According to the statistics given by the Minister of State, using the centre for the next three weeks could potentially result in 12,000 to 15,000 people being vaccinated.  That is surely a good thing and would give the HSE time to find a plan B.  Will the Minister of State ask the HSE to look at using the Arklow Bay Hotel for the next three weeks?  I assume the State has paid for a three-month contract, yet not a single Covid vaccination has been administered there.  It seems like a wasted opportunity not to use the site for the next three weeks.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge problems for people from south Wicklow in accessing the Greystones centre.  There is limited public transport available and that is causing a lot of problems.  It does not make sense to have people going to Greystones from Arklow and elsewhere in south Wicklow as well as from County Wexford while people in Greystones have to go to Dublin to get their vaccine.  I have spoken to the National Transport Authority, NTA, about putting in place a bus service from south Wicklow and north Wexford to Greystones.  Today, I telephoned Wexford Bus and was told the company is keen and eager to provide a service.  I ask the Minister of State to contact the NTA to make sure public transport provision is put in place.  That should have been done already.  It is critical that it be provided now given there is no plan B for people from south Wicklow to get their vaccinations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100060#HHH00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1620769500,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I understand the HSE has decided that it does not make sense from a logistical perspective to operate a Covid-19 vaccination centre at the Arklow facility for the short period involved.  The vaccination roll-out programme continues to demonstrate agility and responsiveness to revisions in the advice on the use of vaccines and changes to vaccine delivery schedules.  The public online registration system was launched on Thursday, 15 April, commencing with appointments for 65- to 69-year-olds before extending out to include all those aged 60 to 64.  Last week saw the commencement of registrations on the portal system for the cohort aged 50 to 59.  From Thursday, 13 May those aged 50 will be invited to register.  To date, more than 34% of the adult population identified to receive a vaccine have received a first dose and almost 13% of the adult population are fully vaccinated.  The programme remains on track and Ireland compares favourably with our European neighbours.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great sense of optimism and relief at the numbers of people getting the vaccines.  I got a text message this evening calling me for vaccination tomorrow.  I will be leaving in the next 20 minutes to drive to Sligo to get my AstraZeneca vaccine at 9.30 in the morning.  I am very happy and excited to be getting it.
