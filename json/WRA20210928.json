On 31 May and 2 June and, most recently again, on 13 and 14 September, I met with the Chief Executives of all local authorities including both Galway City and County Councils, where a range of issues relating to the Housing for All plan were discussed, including land, funding and resources.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All contains strong commitments on strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects. Supports are being provided to all local authorities through the Housing Delivery Co-Ordination Office (HDCO), which has been established within the Local Government Management Agency.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is also supporting local authorities in the area of land acquisition through an early payment arrangement for suitable sites.  I hope that both Galway local authorities will be utilising this opportunity to add to their land holdings and take advantage of early payment arrangements.  My Department is also working with the Galway local authorities and others to develop housing proposals where possible to utilise sites that carry debt for the authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  Galway City Council has availed of the Land Aggregation Scheme (LAGS) which assists in the gradual unwinding of Housing Finance Agency (HFA) loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme. Under the Scheme, local authorities could for a nominal fee, transfer residential development land on which there were outstanding HFA loans to the Housing Agency. The Galway City Council site at Ballymoneen Road, Ballyburke was redeemed under LAGS in full at a cost of &euro;7m.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the delivery of affordable housing schemes, Housing for All delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system. It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum and will see 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes built, alongside 90,000 social homes. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, the Housing for All strategy contains a multi-pronged approach to improving affordability.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of delivery of affordable housing interventions by local authorities, my Department together with the Housing Agency has met with the Galway local authorities regarding structures for the procurement and delivery of affordable housing.  Local authorities intending to advance an affordable purchase scheme can apply to my Department for Exchequer funding of up to &euro;100,000 per unit under the Affordable Housing Fund. It is anticipated that in most cases nationally, affordable homes will be delivered via partnership arrangements between local authorities and contractors whereby the majority of development funding is provided by the contracted body.  Direct sales agreements will provide for the sale of homes directly from the contracted party to the eligible purchaser referred by the local authority.  In this way the financial risk for the local authority is minimised.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these distinct shared equity schemes, Housing for All also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the above, Housing for All also provides the following supports -<\/p>  <p>  - increased funding provided to the Land Development Agency,<\/p>  <p>  - the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to service sites and refurbish existing vacant properties in regional towns and villages,<\/p>  <p>  - a higher stamp duty rate for institutional investors that purchase family homes,<\/p>  <p>  - increased regulation of short-term letting properties,<\/p>  <p>  - additional measures to reduce vacancy rates, and<\/p>  <p>  - expanded supports for retrofitting existing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[46391\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a cost analysis on public funding used by local authorities to rent private homes for social housing over a 25 year lease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":52,"content":"<p>An analysis of expenditure on housing supports was carried out by the Irish Government Economic &amp;amp; Evaluation Service (IGEES) within the Department of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in 2017. This analysis concluded that cost levels within each of the schemes funded under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme, which includes long term leasing, were generally below average rent price levels in the market, and as such, each of the schemes were meeting their individual operating objectives, and reducing the price impact on the market.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the 2017 review, IGEES carried out a further analysis, published in July 2018, focusing on the comparative analysis of delivery streams particularly related to cost effectiveness. This report found that in certain areas, where house prices are higher - e.g. Dublin and Meath - the net present cost (NPC) of delivering units via current funding programmes such as leasing is higher than construction or acquisition.  In areas where house prices are lower &ndash; e.g. Mayo and Tipperary - the NPC of leasing and other current funding programmes is either at or below that for construction and acquisition. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst the 2018 report found that relative cost efficiency is an important consideration in terms of the mix of delivery, it also found that it is not the only consideration and must be viewed in the context of policy objectives and wider issues. In this context, as well as relative costs, a number of other considerations must be taken into account in terms of the overall mix of delivery including the speed of delivery, the quality and appropriateness of accommodation, sectoral capacity and flexibility. <\/p>  <p>  Looking at the most recent cost information available, the average cost for a leased unit, based on leased units claimed for the first half of 2021, is &euro;11,904 per housing unit. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, a full spending review of the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), which includes long term leasing, is currently being undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[46458\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on the inclusion of the refurbishment as well as the purchase cost of houses by first-time buyers in the Rebuilding Ireland home plan scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is designed to enable credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range, or to self build. <\/p><p>It does not include undertaking renovation projects and there are no plans to change this requirement at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[46471\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the way the new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund will support villages and towns across rural Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[46472\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the scale of his ambition for the cities' fund which will help with the cost of high-density units for buyers as outlined in Housing for All.","asker":"1549","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[46475\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund to increase owner-occupier apartment development in city centres will apply to urban villages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 116 and 169 together.<\/p>  <p>  Our recently launched Housing for All plan sets out four pathways to a sustainable housing system. A key objective is that everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life. <\/p>  <p>  Aligned with our overall National Planning Framework (NPF) objective for compact growth, vibrant, liveable cities and towns must offer options for both owner occupiers and renters, at all income levels.  The new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund as outlined in Housing for All, is intended to ensure that aligned with the objectives of the NPF, additional choices are made available to home buyers in our urban cores, and town centres.  It will do this by working to extend home ownership options, where the choice is currently limited:<\/p>  <p>  - In urban areas, for apartment living in developments over a certain height\/density threshold;<\/p>  <p>  - In towns, where options for building new private dwellings have been constrained by the lack of serviced sites. <\/p>  <p>  In higher density locations, the number of apartments being built for sale poses a challenge.  We are also aware of a high level of unactivated permissions, particularly for apartments, in our urban areas.  A Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) fund is being established, which through a competitive bid process, will seek to deliver developments at a viable cost for sale to owner occupiers, targeted principally at  activating the planning permissions already in place for such homes over the coming five years.  It will be managed by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Different challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply. There is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high.  A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Housing Agency to develop an operational basis for this new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund, which will work alongside other related funds such as the Affordable Housing Fund and complement measures forthcoming in the Towns Centre First (TCF) policy framework, details of which are expected to be finalised over Q4 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":61,"content":"<p>Question No. 116 answered with Question No. 115.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[46408\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800065#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason for the long delay in the publication of the State architecture policy.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>The National Policy on Architecture (NPA) is at an advanced stage of development.

Other measures such as Cost Rental will deliver approximately 18,000 homes over the period 2021 to 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  This is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. The Help to Buy scheme also continues to help purchasers to access homes. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the Housing for All strategy provides a range of measures to increase and accelerate the delivery of housing, such as increased funding provided to the Land Development Agency, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative, measures to reduce vacancy rates, and expanded supports for retrofitting existing homes. In addition, the Government has introduced new, higher-rate stamp duty measures and planning permission restrictions to minimise the bulk buying of traditional family homes.<\/p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will increase the supply of affordable homes and improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Leave","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[46327\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress to date on establishing and implementing maternity leave arrangements for councillors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[46207\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on progress relating to the establishment and implementation of maternity leave for councillors; the interactions his Department has had with councillors and other Departments and State bodies on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[46321\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will report on the progress to date on establishing and implementing maternity leave for councillors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 140 and 143 together.<\/p>  <p>  Councillors, like members of the Oireachtas, are office holders rather than employees. As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees on issues such as maternity leave, sick leave and annual leave.<\/p>  <p>  As matters stand, it is under the provisions of Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 that councillors may be absent for maternity purposes. Under Section 18, a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of 6 consecutive months.  Where the absence is due to illness or &ldquo;in good faith for another reason&rdquo;, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months by resolution of the Council.<\/p>  <p>  A councillor who is absent for 6 months will continue to receive the full amount of his or her Representational Payment, currently worth &euro;25,788 per annum. Thereafter this payment is reduced by 50% for absences of 6 to 12 months duration. A councillor who is absent for more than 12 months will not receive any further payments regardless of the reason for the absence. <\/p>  <p>  With effect from January 2017, the Social Welfare Acts were amended so that councillors gained access to the same benefits as self-employed contributors.  Accordingly, councillors are now reckonable for the purposes of accessing Class S benefits, including Maternity Benefit.   <\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of Ms Sara Moorhead S.C.&rsquo;s Review of the Role and Remuneration of Local Authority Elected Members, I approved the establishment of a working group of key local government stakeholders, including councillor representative organisations.  The working group was tasked with drawing up an Action Plan for examination and implementation of the non-pay related recommendations in the Moorhead Report. Addressing these non-pay issues, together with the significant pay reforms for elected members that were approved by Government and brought into effect on 1st July 2021, will facilitate the retention of existing councillors, while also maximising the accessibility of local government to future candidates.  <\/p>  <p>  As I believe that the issue of maternity leave warrants urgent attention and includes wider matters and supports other than maternity leave, I asked the local government stakeholder working group to establish a subgroup specifically to examine all maternity-related matters for councillors.  This group, which is a representative and cross political party group of women councillors, has met a number of times to date, and has given my officials and I greater understanding of the needs of women councillors in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  My officials are working closely with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal issues identified.  My intention, over the coming months, is to bring forward a package of maternity-related measures, including proposals for legislative change, which councillors will be able to avail of. <\/p>  <p>The absence of maternity leave is a perceived obstacle to the participation of women in local government. It is however one that I am determined to address as a matter of urgency, in a progressive and comprehensive manner. This will help to ensure that councillors are more fully representative of the constituents they serve, but also that the role of the councillor is accessible, manageable and sustainable for all.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC01000"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[46392\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a report on the Housing First model from 2019 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[46016\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the percentage of the existing housing need that will be met by the revised Housing First targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 148 together.<\/p>  <p>  Housing First is a targeted housing-led intervention, that enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations.

Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational\/community\/religious buildings.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. This mapping process will take approximately nine months to complete.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department proposes to advance interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.

This was the first face to face engagement on the process since the policy paper was published and allowed both sides to clearly set out their positions on the process. It was agreed by both sides that further clarification was required to enable the talks to continue and it was mutually agreed to adjourn the talks further until the Autumn. It is intended that the talks will recommence in the coming weeks. The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[46319\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will consider removing the section in the draft development plan guidelines which restricts councillors from addressing matters that are the subject of other legislative provisions such as NZEB and passive house; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1574","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>My Department is currently updating Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans.

The introduction of the rent increase restriction of 4%  in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) had regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords and takes account of local rental market factors, providing certainty to tenants and landlords with regard to medium-term rent levels.  <\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This measure significantly reduces the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. The linkage with HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation while protecting against a significant increase in rental inflation in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  When bringing forward this legislation, the need to carefully monitor inflation was recognised. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3% p.a. in August, I intend to bring forward the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021 to undergo pre legislative scrutiny by the end of this D&aacute;il term, which will re-examine the operation of RPZs to ensure that effective rent controls are in place while new supply of rental accommodation comes on stream.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. It remains the position that rent reviews in RPZs can occur no more frequently than annually. The most vulnerable tenants, impacted by Covid-19, also continue to be legally protected from rent increases and eviction under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.   <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords, a blanket extension of the RPZ rent predictability measure to rental properties across the entire country or a three year rent freeze, is considered legally questionable and highly vulnerable to legal challenge.  The Housing Agency continually monitors the rental market and may recommend further areas with the highest and fastest growing rent to be designated as RPZs.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[46425\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the amendments to the Household Means Policy of March 2021 allow for recent changes in circumstance to be taken into account; his views on whether these amendments mean that persons with significant time on the housing list are being struck-off the list entirely; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1460","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[46426\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if local authorities have discretion in their application of the recent changes to the household means policy issued in March 2021.","asker":"1460","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 165 together.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.

Local authorities have been advised that design- build rapid delivery approaches should be adopted where appropriate to deliver social housing projects on local authority-owned land.<\/p>  <p>  To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) put in place a framework of design-build contractors in 2017. This framework which expired in February 2021, was available for all local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to use in the interest of accelerated delivery.  While some local authorities have progressed projects using the framework, the scope of works was generally limited to certain development sizes and unit types. On this basis, other local authorities have implemented their own frameworks, while some have tendered on individual projects for design-build contractors, on a case by case basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Housing Delivery and Co-ordination Office and my Department are currently working with the local government sector on replacement frameworks which will operate on a regional basis and cater to a variety of development sizes and unit types, including apartments. In addition, Dublin City Council has developed a framework of design-build contractors for the delivery of a volumetric programme of houses and apartments which is available to all local authorities and AHBs to use on larger projects. It is envisaged that over 1,000 fast-track homes will be built using the Dublin City framework, and while the majority of these will be in Dublin, there will also likely be schemes in other large centres.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the issues around delivery that non-prefabricated social housing construction projects face, are also faced by design-build projects, such as preparing sites, services\/access to the site, community consultation, planning, etc.  There can, however, be savings in terms of programme and construction time with these advantages growing as more use is made of these frameworks and as contractors gain more experience in implementing these methods. Under this mechanism, acceleration is delivered both by the use of the design-build services of specialist contractors and reduced construction time periods due to considerable off site fabrication. As well as off-site construction providing many benefits in terms of delivery and affordability, the new frameworks will provide sustainable and durable quality housing. All new dwellings (including prefabricated and modular build units) must comply with the building regulations and building control requirements and for social housing achieve a 60-year durability for all key elements.<\/p>  <p>My Department will continue to work with local authorities to maximise delivery and harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units, including through design-build schemes.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC05500"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[46449\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC05600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the review of the NPWS; and when the review is expected to be published.","asker":"1545","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[46947\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the chairperson has submitted their final report with regard to the Strategic Review of the National Parks and Wildlife Service that commenced on 3 February 2021; if the recommendations made in the review have been agreed and accepted; if so, when the report will be published; if funding for implementation of the recommendations has been agreed; if so, if he will provide a breakdown of the costs, including any funding being sought in the estimates for 2022; and if a copy of the implementation schedule for all agreed recommendations will be provided.","asker":"1564","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 322 together.<\/p><p>The NPWS review is currently underway and is at drafting stage following the extensive research and consultation phase.

The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However,\u00a0as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in \"Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland\", the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC06200"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[46442\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC06300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the constraints leading to delays and blockages in the provision of housing; the actions being taken by his Department to overcome these constraints and blockages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I believe <b>Housing for All: A New Housing Plan for Ireland <\/b>will transform our housing system, removing the constraints leading to delays and blockages in the provision of housing. In particular, the actions set out under Pathway 3 of the Plan, &quot;Increasing New Housing Supply&quot;, will create the environment needed to enable the supply of over 300,000 new homes by 2030, meaning an annual average of at least 33,000 homes per year. <\/p><p>Crucially, the Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs. <\/p><p>In order to ensure there is a sufficient supply of homes across the country, each Local Authority has been given Housing Supply Targets. These, together with updated planning guidance, will ensure sufficient land is zoned for housing. The Government will support this by providing additional State lands to the LDA, capable of delivering up to 15,000 homes. Local authorities will also be funded to acquire additional land so that they can deliver social and affordable homes at scale.<\/p><p>In addition, <b>Housing for All<\/b>tasks the LDA, through Project Tosaigh, with intervening in slow or stalled developments on non-State lands, through an open and transparent process, designed to ascertain the potential for it to enter into strategic partnerships with landowners in order to unlock and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.<\/p><p>In tandem with these measures to incentivise the bringing forward of supply, there is a need to balance this with penalties for non-activation of sites. In this regard, the Minister for Finance will bring forward a new tax to activate vacant land for residential purposes (to replace the current vacant site levy).<\/p><p>I am also cognisant that the planning system must be reformed to ensure that there is certainty and stability for those providing housing in Ireland. Under <b>Housing for All<\/b>the Strategic Housing Development Process will be replaced with new planning arrangements for large-scale residential developments. Such reforms will make decision-making on these developments more efficient whilst returning primary decision-making to the local level.<\/p><p>The judicial review process will also be reformed and planning legislation will be reviewed to ensure the planning system is plan-led, has greater public acceptance and reflects the needs of existing and new populations. <\/p><p>In the shorter term, I want to see non-activated planning permissions activated. In this regard, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund will stimulate such activation for apartment developments of four floors or more, above certain densities and these apartments will be for sale to owner occupiers. <\/p><p>Finally, the delivery an average of 33,000 homes per year requires an expansion of the current workforce. Through the actions laid out in <b>Housing for All<\/b>industry will be supported in returning existing workers to full employment and there will be proactive engagement with international labour where supply is unavailable locally. There will also be a ramp-up in education and training opportunities, including commitments regarding programmes and apprenticeships and delivery of new courses.<\/p><p><b>Housing for All <\/b>takes a genuine whole of Government approach to creating a long-term, sustainable housing system for Ireland. I am confident that the breadth of measures and reforms therein will remove impediments to progress and provide for the much-needed delivery of homes at scale.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800066#WRC06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":144,"content":"<p>Question No. 140 answered with Question No. 122.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800067#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[46427\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800067#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on the current situation in which the funding for housing adaptation grants is inadequate to cope with demand, leading to a situation in which many county councils have significant backlogs which have rolled over from 2020 and are causing long delays given his commitment to supporting elderly persons to live in their own homes; if he plans to increase the funding to local authorities in order to clear the backlog; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>Funding of &euro;75 million is available nationally in 2021 for the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme.

Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.

The cost and supply issues that have arisen for basic building materials such as steel, timber, concrete and plastics are also occurring internationally. They appear to result from a range of contributory factors including Brexit, the disruption caused by Covid 19, increased global demand and other global events that have impacted on supply chains.  Reducing residential construction costs is a key theme within Housing for All, with actions centred on analysis, innovation, research and productivity through a whole-of-government approach in collaboration with Industry. <\/p>  <p>  The Housing for All Strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, the Housing for All strategy contains a multi-pronged approach to improving affordability. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these distinct shared equity schemes, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes. <\/p>  <p>  Further to the above, the Housing for All strategy also provides the following supports;<\/p>  <p>  - increased funding provided to the Land Development Agency,<\/p>  <p>  - the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to service sites and refurbish existing vacant properties in regional towns and villages,<\/p>  <p>  - a higher stamp duty rate for institutional investors that purchase family homes,<\/p>  <p>  - increased regulation of short-term letting properties.<\/p>  <p>  - additional measures to reduce vacancy rates, and<\/p>  <p>  - expanded supports for retrofitting existing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800067#WRD04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800067#WRD04900"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[46211\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800067#WRD05000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the Departmental working group set up to investigate potential amendments to building regulations to require changing places (details supplied) in suitable public buildings; the number of times the group has met; if he plans to meet with the group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>New buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards for the design and construction of buildings set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2021.

Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and ensure that such applications are dealt with within timeframes that are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum. Different timescales may apply where the local authority requires additional information from the applicant within the relevant period, as defined in the Regulations, thus leading to possible extensions to the 12 week deadline in terms of completing the application process.<\/p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the challenges faced throughout 2020 and into 2021 due to the Covid emergency measures, local authorities and the Housing Assistance Payment Shared Service Centre (HAP SSC) have continued to provide a critical service to all HAP customers. <\/p>  <p>  Measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19 did, however, have an impact on processing times for HAP applications. <\/p>  <p>  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP SSC.

This plan will cover the conversion of the area known as the Nephin Forest and its integration into the National Park. The Wild Nephin Conversion Plan (Phase I) will facilitate the rewilding and restoration of the landscapes and habitats of Wild Nephin, allowing natural ecological processes to become the dominant drivers of the landscape, where biodiversity is enhanced, ecosystems restored, and low impact recreation opportunities will connect people with nature across generations.<\/p><p>The rewilding and habitat restoration of Wild Nephin aims to support a natural and biodiverse ecosystem which will provide a connection to a larger community of life by encouraging the enjoyment of nature, solitude and challenging recreation without creating a significant human impact on this area of outstanding natural beauty, where nature is the priority. The project is based on actions to be taken in the first 15 years of habitat restoration through the establishment of goals which are informed by the overall nature conservation objectives of the NPWS alongside national and international legislation, policies and agreements. These include links with the Natura 2000 Network, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Paris Climate Agreement and the Bern Convention alongside links in with strategies such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the current situation globally in regards to biodiversity loss and the climate crisis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800068#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800068#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[46335\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800068#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the submissions for funding, building or purchasing housing in Dublin 6W, 8, 10, 12 that have been received from Dublin City Council in the past five years; the stage of consideration the requests are at; the number of housing units involved; and in the cases of refusal to fund, the reasons that were given.","asker":"1485","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>My Department provides both capital and current funding to local authorities across a range of funding initiatives to assist them in providing homes for families and individuals on their social housing waiting lists.

Once a conspicuous part of Ireland&rsquo;s landscape, they were driven to extinction by human persecution here in the late Nineteenth Century. The first Phase ran from 2007-2011, managed by NPWS and the Golden Eagle Trust, when 100 chicks were released into the wild. Since then, over 35 Irish-born chicks have fledged here, some of whom have begun to rear their own chicks. Indeed, this year one nesting pair on Lough Derg produced three chicks. This is uncommon, even in the very extensive wild populations in Norway.<\/p>  <p>  The Second Phase was launched last year, when ten Norwegian-born chicks were flown into Ireland and released into the wild on the Shannon Estuary and Lough Derg. Of these ten, an astonishing nine are still alive, and have travelled throughout the country, with one even travelling to Scotland.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2021, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department and partners  released a further twenty-one Norwegian-born Eagle chicks into the wild to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s existing White-Tailed Eagle population from a number of locations in Cork, Kerry, Clare and Waterford. They were collected from nests by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in June this year, and were imported to Ireland via Kerry Airport.  They were kept in purpose-built enclosures while they grew, matured, and developed the feathers and muscles necessary for flight. <\/p>  <p>  All 21 of the chicks are out in the natural environment and doing well.  The birds will remain local for another 4\/5 weeks and will then move out to explore and find new areas.  All of the eagles are satellite tagged and readings are taken every day to discern their movements and locations.<\/p>  <p>  The success of both this year's and last year&rsquo;s releases was thanks to the hard work of both the NPWS staff and the input and assistance of other interested parties.

The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along some 699 schools. The NBP roll out is currently a 7 year plan under the contract and deployment is due to be complete by the end of 2026.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of 17 September, over 250,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed with over 108,000 premises under construction in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  The network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or the state owned metropolitan area networks (MANs).

The Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021.

EirGrid is the transmission system operator and its responsibilities include the appropriate development of the grid and power system to achieve our energy policy objectives and underpin economic development.  The CRU is the independent energy regulator and, through a formal price review process, it decides on appropriate spend by EirGrid on a five-year basis.   The most recent price review decision by the CRU in December 2020 on the allowable spend on our electricity grid over the next five years signalled a significant and necessary increase in funds for grid enhancement. EirGrid already seeks to optimise the existing electricity grid to minimise the need for new infrastructure through upgrades, refurbishment or up-voltaging of existing infrastructure, where possible. However, in light of the Government's ambition to have at least 70% renewable electricity on the power system by 2030, and with demand profiles increasing as we continue to electrify more sectors of our economy, including heat and transport, further investment in the power grid will be required over the coming decade.<\/p>  <p>  The CRU as part of its oversight has issued a final determination for funding over the next five years to the end of 2025 (PR5 - Price Review 5) which can be found on the CRU website.

Counties are generally made up of a number of DAs which means there are differing timescales for connection across county areas. <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network in the immediate term, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The forthcoming updated Climate Action Plan 2021 retains this commitment to transforming the national vehicle fleet to a zero emissions fleet, and contains a range of measures to support the public and business in transitioning to electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made, as a result of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 43,500 now. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The EVPP Working Group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  <\/p>  <p>  The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government  and the full report is now available online. <\/p>  <p>  In order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that:  <\/p>  <p>  - The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and\/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and   <\/p>  <p>  - An Office for Low Emission Vehicles should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new Office should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800073#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800073#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[46596\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800073#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address concerns regarding potential delays to the DART plus and MetroLink projects; the actions that are being taken to ensure that delays will not have an impact on the projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":492,"content":"<p>DART+ is a programme which actually comprises five different projects, each of which is moving at different speeds and is at different stages of development, while MetroLink is likely the largest ever public investment project in the history of the State.

Bus lanes are designed to make bus journeys both faster and more reliable so as to encourage members of the public out of their cars and onto public transport. This, in turn, reduces both congestion and air pollution and is considerably more environmentally sustainable than car-based transport in the long run. As the populations of our urban centres multiply and public awareness of the importance of sustainable transport grows, it is likely that both bus passenger numbers and, by extension, the provision of bus services and the demand for bus lanes will continue to increase year on year.

In addition there is a commitment to bring new homes, which were outside the LPT, into the taxation system. <\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 fulfils the Programme for Government commitments in this area and secures the future of the Local Property Tax (LPT). The 2021 Act provides inter alia that residential properties built since 2013 will be liable for LPT for 2022 onwards.  I have no plans to alter this position.  The vast majority of residential property owners have been paying LPT since 2013 and their situation vis-&agrave;-vis property owners who have remained outside the scope of LPT has become highly inequitable and untenable. I am very concerned that this inequity does not continue into 2022 when property owners at 1 May 2013 are due to pay LPT based on their new value as at 1 November 2021. Deferring LPT as suggested in the deputy&rsquo;s question would have the effect of continuing this inequitable situation and I do not see any basis for doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Any residential property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options in respect of LPT. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners via the LPT portal on the Revenue website. Residential property owners can make direct contact with Revenue at telephone number (01) 7383626 or by writing to LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Limerick, where every effort will be made to agree a suitable payment arrangement.    <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has engaged extensively with residential property owners who are experiencing financial difficulties since the pandemic began to agree flexible LPT payment arrangements that best suit their circumstances and avoid unnecessary hardship, and it has assured me that this will continue to be the case.   <\/p>  <p>  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is charged on the deferred amount. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that for 2022 the deferral income thresholds will be increased to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple.

A detailed reply was issued in that instance (Dail Question No. 217 - Reference 42979\/21) and there have been no substantive developments or adjustments to the previous answer in the interim period.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), which is provided by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2020, was introduced to support businesses (companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships) significantly affected by restrictions introduced by the Government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The CRSS operates on a self-assessment basis, and claimants are required to satisfy themselves that they are correctly eligible for the scheme before registering to receive payments. Claimants are also required to review their continued eligibility for the scheme before making a claim for payment in respect of each subsequent claim period.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the CRSS, a business must operate from a business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, requiring it to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its premises. It is not sufficient that a business experiences a reduction in demand for its services or a reduced footfall because of the general public health guidelines around social distancing and related protective measures which apply to society as a whole.  For example, dry cleaning and laundry businesses were not required to restrict customer access under the public health measures and as such do not qualify for the CRSS, even if service demand is reduced. Such businesses may however qualify for the other support schemes introduced to support them during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question operates a dry-cleaning service and incorrectly claimed and received CRSS payments to which it was not entitled, which must be repaid in due course. Revenue has also confirmed that it accepts that the business genuinely believed that it qualified for the scheme and that repayment of the amount owed as a single payment could cause it financial difficulties. To avoid such a scenario to the greatest extent possible, Revenue will engage directly with the business to agree a suitable payment solution, including the possibility of adding the amount owed to its current warehoused debt under the Debt Warehousing Scheme, even though that scheme does not specifically provide for CRSS related liabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The company may be also eligible to register for the new Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), which is an additional support for businesses with reduced turnover due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Further details on the BRSS, which is now operational, are available on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed that in addition to receiving financial support through the Debt Warehousing Scheme, the Business is also receiving payments under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800073#WRK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800073#WRK05700"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[46029\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800073#WRK05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the resumption of applications for primary medical certificates will commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:  <\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;  <\/p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p><p>- be without one or both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. <\/p><p>The medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.

Loss relief works by allowing a deduction for losses incurred in one accounting period against profits earned in another period.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 precludes Revenue officials from directly or indirectly disclosing taxpayer information to third parties in respect of specific taxpayers. Therefore it is not possible to provide estimates based on such a small cohort of taxpayers.  However, based on public information as to pre-COVID-19 profitability levels, a 25% limit on the Corporation Tax losses forward that can be used in one year would likely not yield significant additional tax, due to the amounts of losses forward available to the relevant companies.  <\/p><p>A five-year restriction on the carry forward of losses, if applied in respect of losses incurred to date, could mean that these companies are no longer able to use the historic losses that are being carried forward since the financial crisis.

This is why the recently announced strategy, &lsquo;Housing For All&rsquo; states that my Department will collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a Vacant Property Tax.<\/p>  <p>  The recently enacted Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enables Revenue to collect certain limited information on vacant properties in the LPT return form it will issue to property owners in advance of the new LPT valuation date of 1 November next.

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme nationally, from which the relevant funding for the Enniscorthy scheme will be made available, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal confirmation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) to proceed. This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts(ADA), which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme. This involves, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) commissioned by WCC and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to MPER as part of the formal Confirmation process.<\/p>  <p>  DPER ran the statutory public consultation period required in relation to this process from July 28th to August 28th, 2020. The initial phase of the review of the EIAR and NIS was carried out by consultants engaged for this purpose by DPER, during September and early October. DPER subsequently forwarded submissions from the public consultation, and the EIAR and NIS reviews, to the OPW, along with a request for supplementary information, pursuant to ADA regulations 2019, to ensure that the design of the scheme complies with relevant environmental directives and regulations. <\/p>  <p>  The OPW, Wexford County Council, and scheme consultants Mott Mc Donald formally submitted their response to DPER in the final week of April 2021.  DPER confirmed that they have received the independent consultants&rsquo; review of this information and are finalising their assessment of the supplementary information. <\/p>  <p>  Completion of the above tasks and the progression of the flood relief scheme is a priority for all parties. In parallel with the confirmation process, OPW and Wexford County Council have been working on the following to ensure as efficient progression of the works as possible once the scheme is confirmed &ndash;   <\/p>  <p>  - Foreshore Licence Application public consultation has been completed, documentation is under review by the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage , and approval is expected 2021. <\/p>  <p>  - Technical approvals have been received from Irish Rail for the railway line crossings and from Irish Water for the diversion of services, the legal agreements with Irish Rail and Irish Water are complete, and will be signed post confirmation. <\/p>  <p>  - Tender Pre-qualification for contractors for the bridgeworks was re-advertised and is currently being assessed.

I am pleased to be able to report that this ambitious new North South EU-funded programme is now in the final stages of development.<\/p><p>PEACE PLUS was first proposed by the European Commission in 2018 as part of its package of measures for the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) and Cohesion Policy for the 2021-27 period. This proposal was and remains a clear demonstration of the importance placed by the EU, and by the Irish and UK Governments, of ensuring continued investment for peace, prosperity and cross-border cooperation, in support of the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p><p>PEACE PLUS will cover an eligible area of Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland (i.e. Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo). It will replace the current PEACE and INTERREG cross-border EU programmes by combining these two funding streams into one cohesive new North South programme for 2021-27. <\/p><p>The cross-border Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) has been leading the development of PEACE PLUS, working in close cooperation with my Department and with the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland. The SEUPB has been assisted in this development task by a cross-sectoral Programme Development Steering Group (PDSG). This steering group consists of representatives of central and local government, environmental, rural, voluntary, community, equality, business and trade union groups from both Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>The development of PEACE PLUS has also been shaped by extensive stakeholder engagement. This has included two major public consultation exercises, which saw events held in every county of the eligible area for the new programme, as well as the collection of several hundred written submissions. There has also been close engagement between Government Departments North and South in order to agree and develop areas of cross-border collaboration under the new programme.<\/p><p>On foot of this considerable preparatory work, the SEUPB has finalised a draft PEACE PLUS programme based on six thematic investment areas:  <\/p><p>- Building Peaceful and Thriving Communities; <\/p><p>- Delivering Economic Regeneration and Transformation; <\/p><p>- Empowering and Investing in Young People; <\/p><p>- Healthy and Inclusive Communities; <\/p><p>- Supporting a Sustainable and Better Connected Future; <\/p><p>- Building and Embedding Partnership and Collaboration.<\/p><p>Details of the investment themes are available in the Consultation Information Document on the SEUPB's PEACE PLUS website, and I encourage anyone with an interest in the new programme to visit to learn more.<\/p><p>PEACE PLUS has an anticipated total budget of over &euro;1 billion. This is around twice the value of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes combined, and demonstrates the scale and ambition of the new programme. This cross-border investment is more important than ever, in the context both of the challenges of Brexit and recovery from the pandemic. <\/p><p>I look forward to bringing the draft PEACE PLUS programme to Government for approval shortly.

Over the course of the year, my Department works closely with the local authorities to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding. This means that if underspends arise on the part of some local authorities, they can be redistributed to other authorities. If a local authority is dealing with a high level of applications, further additional funding can be requested from my Department and every effort will be made to accede to any such request.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800077#WRO02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":760,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800077#WRO02400"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[46485\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800077#WRO02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will request that the publication of annual figures by the Housing Agency related to those availing or requesting housing support are segregated by disability or specialised housing need; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":762,"content":"<p>Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area are set out in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) published by the Housing Agency.

The Department of Housing played a key part in helping to develop the National Student Accommodation Strategy in 2017 the production of which was an action under Rebuilding Ireland.  The strategy was published by the then Department of Education and Science and includes eight key targets and 27 actions to support the delivery of an increased level of supply of Student Accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  The two Departments also worked in close co-operation in passing the Residential Tenancies Act 2018. That Act contained provisions designed to improve protections and affordability measures for students residing in student-specific accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that Housing for All : A New Housing Plan for Ireland will transform every aspect of our housing including the area of student accommodation. The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. Crucially Housing for All takes a genuine whole of Government approach to creating a long-term, sustainable housing system for Ireland. I am confident that the breadth of measures and reforms therein will remove impediments to progress and provide for the delivery of much needed additional accommodation at scale. This will prove to be of benefit to all those seeking safe, affordable and secure accommodation including our growing student population. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, Housing for All contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency. My Department is already working closely with DFHERIS to deliver on this commitment and I expect top see progress in the near future.

This measure significantly reduced the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. The linkage with HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation while protecting against a significant increase in rental inflation in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that an index, other than HICP, may be prescribed for the purposes of restricting rent increases in RPZs. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3% p.a. in August, I will consider all the legal options available to me to ensure that effective rent controls are legally in force in RPZs to cap the rate of any rent increase where the general inflation rate is too high.  Any necessary provision relating to rent control in RPZs will be considered in the context of the impending Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining this matter and the advices of the Office of the Attorney General will inform any changes in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800078#WRP00718","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":813,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800078#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[46679\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800078#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the Land Development Agency will be able to apply for either the cost rental equity loan or the affordable housing fund for the provision of affordable housing.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":815,"content":"<p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) was established on an interim basis in September 2018, by way of an Establishment Order made under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971.

The implementation of Housing for All has already begun. There are 213 objectives in this plan, all of which will be delivered according to the dates outlined in the plan itself. The first progress report on Q3 2021 actions is currently being prepared for publication.<\/p>  <p>  Not only will there be oversight and direction at the highest level through the Cabinet Committee on Housing (chaired by the Taoiseach), and the Secretary General Delivery Group (chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach), there will also be dedicated Workstreams, led by the relevant Secretaries General, on i) investment, ii) industry capability, and iii) public service delivery. These Workstreams are tasked with drilling down into the priority actions, to identify any blockages, take appropriate action, and ensure a rigorous monitoring system is in place to ensure delivery. <\/p>  <p>  To keep us on track, the actions in Housing for All will be updated on an annual basis, including timelines, to sustain momentum on delivery during the lifetime of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is a radical plan that sets out four pathways to a sustainable housing system. Affordability and the chance to own a home is at the heart of this government&rsquo;s housing policy. It recognises that significant new supports are needed so that those who want to own their own home can do so, and that those who wish to rent are able to do so at an affordable rate. Pathway 1 &lsquo;Supporting homeownership and increasing affordability ' addresses this issue and sets out a number of key actions in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  The objective is to supply 300,000 new homes by 2030, meaning an annual average of at least 33,000 homes per year. This includes an average of 10,000 social homes and 6,000 affordable homes made available each year for purchase or rent up to 2030. This will have a dramatic impact on the provision of housing and will significantly help facilitate house buyers. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, Housing for All contains a multi-pronged approach to supply and improving affordability.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Authority Home Loan will be expanded, extending its reach and impact, particularly for single people. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy incentive is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, new higher-rate stamp duty measures and planning permission restrictions have been introduced that will minimise the bulk buying of traditional family homes. I also plan to introduce a new form of &lsquo;Owner-Occupier Guarantee&rsquo; which will enable Local Authorities to specify a minimum proportion of the houses in a new development for owner occupiers. <\/p>  <p>  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund will stimulate the activation of some apartment developments for sale to individual purchasers. The Land Development Agency (LDA), through Project Tosaigh, will intervene in slow or stalled developments with landowners in order to unlock and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the LDA and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. There is a targeted approach right across the country to supply housing where it is needed most. This is supported by updated planning guidance, additional State land provided for housing, and an increase in funding for Local authorities to acquire new land so that they can deliver social and affordable homes at scale. All of this will help create the environment needed to deliver on the objectives in Housing for All.<\/p>  <p>  I am mindful however that projections for delivery will be heavily influenced by COVID-19 related uncertainties in the earlier years of the Plan. These uncertainties will reduce over time as the impact of the pandemic on the housing backlog is fully established and associated construction related constraints diminish. However, ongoing uncertainties associated with raw material costs and availability, and the sector&rsquo;s capacity to recover, may also impact on delivery but I am confident that Housing for All and the breadth of measures and reforms therein will remove impediments to progress and provide for the much-needed delivery of homes at scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800078#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":837,"content":"<p>Question No. 381 answered with Question No. 378.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":838,"content":"<p>Question No. 382 answered with Question No. 378.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"House Prices","counter":839,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800078#WRP03400"},{"type":"question","counter":840,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[46760\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800078#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the degree to which his Department continues to monitor house price inflation; the action that is in-hand or likely to be taken to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":841,"content":"<p>House price inflation is measured in the Residential Property Index compiled by the CSO which is published monthly, and covers all market purchases of houses and apartments by households.

The periods of lockdown since early 2020 have reduced construction activity and placed limitations on the ability to conduct normal sales activity, and this has impacted on house prices.

Regulations regarding income eligibility in respect of the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be put in place by November.   <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the Housing for All Strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum. <\/p>  <p>  At a national level, over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. These homes will be provided by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency (LDA), as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. <\/p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing newly constructed homes.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800078#WRP05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":862,"content":"<p>Question No. 391 answered with Question No. 378.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":864,"content":"<p>Question No. 392 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800079#WRQ00300"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[46770\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800079#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of Rebuilding Ireland loans approved and drawn down in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":867,"content":"<p>My Department regularly publishes information on the number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.

As famine-like conditions are reported, there is an urgent need for full humanitarian access, a negotiated ceasefire, and the commencement of political dialogue to find a resolution to the conflict: I wish the former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, who has been appointed AU High Representative for the Horn of Africa, well in his mediation efforts.<\/p>  <p>  I am alarmed by the conflict&rsquo;s impact on civilians, including harrowing reports of widespread and ongoing sexual violence, and other serious human rights violations and abuses.   It is vital that perpetrators be held to account.  In this regard, Ireland strongly supports the work underway by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), to investigate reported atrocities. The publication of their joint report on 1 November will be a crucial first step towards accountability.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to take the lead at the UN Security Council to ensure a focus on the situation in Tigray. Ireland spearheaded calls for the most recent open Council meeting on 26 August, where UN Secretary General Guterres underscored the severity of the humanitarian situation, and urged all parties to immediately end hostilities, and negotiate a lasting ceasefire. At that meeting, Ireland reiterated its call for an urgent end to the violence, full humanitarian access, accountability for atrocities, and for a political solution to the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also continues to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis.  There will be a further discussion on Ethiopia and Tigray at the Foreign Affairs Council in October, in which Minister Coveney will participate. Minister Coveney also continues to engage on the situation in Tigray with key interlocutors, including leaders in the region and the Africa Union (AU). On 15 September he met with the EU Special Representative on the Horn of Africa, Dr Annette Weber, to discuss options for addressing the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s continued priority will remain, as always, supporting the needs of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia, including those affected by conflict in Tigray. Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme, has so far provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through trusted UN and NGO partners on the ground. On 7 July, I announced additional humanitarian funding of &euro;2.75m for Ethiopia, to address hunger and insecurity, including in Tigray.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800079#WRQ06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":926,"content":"<p>Question No. 412 answered with Question No. 403.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":927,"content":"<p>Question No. 413 answered with Question No. 411.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800080#WRR00400"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[46386\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800080#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding and status of an application for Irish citizenship by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1519","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":930,"content":"<p>The application to which the Deputy refers was received on 11 January 2021, and is currently waiting to be processed.

The Scheme, which was developed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, provides for ex gratia payments to be made to those who qualify to apply for the Scheme and who satisfy the criteria as set out in the Terms of Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The ex gratia scheme was originally established in 2015 and was put in place to provide those, who had instituted legal proceedings against the State in respect of day school sexual abuse and subsequently discontinued those proceedings following rulings in the domestic courts, with an opportunity to apply for an ex gratia payment.  The Scheme was paused in 2019 following a report from retired High Court Judge Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill who, as Independent Assessor, reviewed a number of unsuccessful applications to the Scheme and was of the view that the criteria to qualify for a payment were too restrictive for this group of applicants.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to fulfilling its obligations in implementing the ECtHR ruling.  This means that the revised scheme is designed first and foremost to provide a remedy to those who had issued and discontinued their proceedings against the State prior to the ECtHR ruling in O'Keeffe v Ireland and who did not receive a payment under the 2015 Scheme.  However, the revised scheme goes beyond that group in that all others who issued civil proceedings against the State at a later date and up to 1 July 2021, whether they are still in being, were discontinued at any point, or who had settled with the State, may also apply for an award.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as broadening the scope of the Scheme, the type and nature of evidence that will be considered by the State Claims Agency in respect of individual applications (and as set out in the Terms of Scheme) broadens the means trough which an applicant can demonstrate that they fall within the terms of the ECtHR judgment.  To date the Scheme Administrator has received 44 applications for an award, of which 36 have been approved so far.  <\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of any legal challenge in respect of the revised ex gratia scheme and therefore am not in a position to comment in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  Full details of the Terms of Scheme are available on www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/90a42-revised-ex-gratia-scheme.

Analysis of the parental preferences expressed in each area surveyed indicated that there was sufficient parental demand to support changes in school patronage in 28 areas, including in Dungarvan. <\/p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school can be opened where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result of an amalgamation\/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, including in the case of Dungarvan, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  To date, it has not been possible to secure a school property to facilitate a new school under the divesting process being established in Dungarvan.

This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and\/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.<\/p>  <p>  The initial identification phase of the process involved each of the 16 Education and Training Boards identifying an initial pilot area within their functional area where they considered there may be unmet oncoming demand for a multi-\/non-denominational school and arranging for surveys of parents of pre-school children in these areas.  The Department has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference (Catholic Bishops)  with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next Phase of the process. The identification phase work provides useful learning and is informing the development of the process.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter.

A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools.

It is not means tested.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the basic principles underpinning the Irish social insurance system is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  <\/p>  <p>  At present the State Pension (Contributory) can be calculated under two different methods known as the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) and the Yearly Average (YA) approach.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation.  Since April 2019 all new State Pension (Contributory)applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  <\/p>  <p>  The Total Contributions Approach to calculation, introduced for pensioners reaching State Pension Age from September 2012, included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme.  It acknowledged, for the first time, home caring periods prior to 1994.  TCA provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those with a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits \/ homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Yearly Average method, in place since the introduction of the state pension in 1961, is a calculation where the number of reckonable weekly PRSI contributions are divided by the number of years between entering social insurance and state pension age.  Entitlement is then banded, with a YA of 48 or more required for a full rate pension.  The YA system measures the frequency rather than the number of contributions.  Since 6 April 1994, the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme has allowed up to 20 years spent as a homemaker to be disregarded when calculating the YA. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of anomalies associated with the YA system.  Entitlement to a full pension can in some cases be achieved from as little as 10 years of social insurance contributions.  This can happen where there is a shorter timespan between first and last social insurance contributions, i.e., someone who enters insurable employment at age 55 and works until they are pension age has time to gain the requisite 520 contributions to qualify for pension, and will have a higher yearly average than someone who has gaps in their record although they may have started work at 16.  <\/p>  <p>  A key concept in the YA calculation is that the number of contributions are calculated from the date of entry into social insurance to the end of the last complete tax year prior to the person's 66th birthday - covering the full period of their time contributing to the social insurance system, regardless of the classes of PRSI paid over that period.<\/p>  <p>  Modified rate contributions are not reckonable for a full standard State Pension (Contributory). However, they are used when calculating entitlement to a mixed insurance pro-rata State Pension (Contributory). <\/p>  <p>  A mixed insurance pro rata state pension is a pro-rata pension, introduced in November 1991, which is based on a combination of full and modified rate contributions.  Prior to this, many persons who paid a mixture of full and modified rate social insurance contributions did not qualify for pension despite the fact that they paid full-rate contributions for part of their working lives.  These persons may now qualify for a pension based on the number of full-rate contributions as a proportion of their total contributions i.e. full and modified rate.<\/p>  <p>  There are also EU and Bilateral pro-rata State Pension Contributory pensions.  The pension is a pro-rata payment based on the proportion of Irish social insurance contributions to the total number of contributions paid and\/or credited, that is, Irish and other insurance combined.<\/p>  <p>  Those who have not built up state pension contributory entitlements in other countries, which are not covered by these agreements, will have gaps in their PRSI record and, whatever the system in place, this could be expected to impact upon their ability to qualify for a maximum rate contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission has now concluded its work and has submitted its final report to me.  The report itself is extremely detailed, running to several hundred pages, and covers a range of complex matters in relation to the Pensions system which will require very careful consideration.  I intend to bring the report to Government in the near future, after which it will be published.  The Government has committed to taking action having regards to the Commission's recommendations within 6 months. <\/p>  <p>  If a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s\/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if his\/her spouse is a State pensioner and has significant household means, his\/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his\/her personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800084#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[46071\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800084#WRV02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>The person concerned, a State pension (contributory) recipient, applied for an Increase for qualified adult (IQA) in respect of his spouse, who is currently in receipt of the maximum rate of State pension (non-contributory) in her own right.<\/p>  <p>  While State pension (contributory) is an insurance-based scheme, the IQA is a means-tested payment, payable to State pension (contributory) claimants whose spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is being wholly or mainly maintained by them, and where that qualified adult&rsquo;s personal means from any source does not exceed a means test income limit.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases. The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. <\/p><p>9,743 craft apprentices are currently waiting for access to off-the-job training.  A breakdown by apprenticeship and phase is attached.<\/p><p>In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:<\/p><p>-  Craft apprentice off-the-job training was prioritised for a return to on-site learning across further and higher education institutions as COVID restrictions allowed.<\/p><p>-  Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.<\/p><p>-  &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand.<\/p><p>-  An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6).<\/p><p>-  A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is in delivery. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.<\/p><p>-  Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training.  An update issued to ETBs on 20 September, with a number of information sessions for staff due to take place over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>-  Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April. Additional capacity coming on stream at phase 4 and 6 from September has resulted with in the region of 2,500 phase 4 and 6 apprentices scheduled to commence off-the-job training in September, up from 2,100 per intake immediately pre-COVID.<\/p><p>-  In the event that Phase 4 and 6 are prevented from returning at full capacity, a number of alternatives remain available to ensure that craft apprentices are not precluded from qualifying in a timely manner, including the potential for competency assessments to allow apprentices to qualify. Any such measure would need to safeguard the integrity of the Craft Certificate qualification.<\/p><p>The additional investment in supports, as well as training providers re-commencing in September at full capacity will mean that by the end of December 2021, the respective proportion of apprentices returned to training will be:<\/p><p>-  35 per cent of Phase 2;<\/p><p>-  40 per cent of Phase 4; and<\/p><p>-  60 per cent of Phase 6 apprentices.<\/p><p>Subject to continued access to workshops and training facilities in addition to the rollout of additional places, it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training at Phases 4 and 6 will be called in the early months of 2022. The waiting list for Phase 2 apprentices is expected to be completely cleared by the end of 2022.<\/p><p>A public update issued on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie<\/i>on 23 September which outlined the comprehensive programme of work underway and to ensure that information is available to apprentices, employers and prospective apprentices.  <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>Apprentices

students with regard to securing accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  The National Student Accommodation Strategy is designed to ensure that there is an increased level of supply of purpose built student accommodation. Several of the actions in this strategy centre around ensuring that HEIs have access to low-cost financing in order to support their building of student accommodation. One of these actions involved the introduction of legislation to empower the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to lend directly to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) for the development of student accommodation. This legislation was commenced in 2017, and so far three universities - TCD, UCC and UCD have had a total of &euro;157 million in loans approved by the HFA, which will provide more than 1,400 new student bed spaces.<\/p>  <p>  In June I, along with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, announced that &euro;75 million of financing had been successfully sourced for the Council of Europe Bank for the building of student accommodation in universities.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of significant unmet demand for student accommodation, I was extremely disappointed to see the recent granting by Local Authorities of \"Change of Use\" permissions to allow privately-owned purpose built student accommodation be used for other purposes. This runs contrary to the Student Accommodation Strategy. I welcome the issuing of a circular to Local Authorities underscoring the critical need for purpose-built student accommodation to be available to meet the needs of students in third level education.<\/p>  <p>  Housing For All, the Government's recently announce plan for housing, contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency. <\/p>  <p>  My officials and I will continue to work with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the universities, and the Union of Students in Ireland on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800086#WRX03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":1305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800086#WRX03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1306,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[45960\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800086#WRX03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the drop-out rate from apprenticeship for each trade per year since 2015, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1307,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[45963\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800086#WRX04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of new registrations for each apprenticeship course since 2015; the number of new registrations to date in 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1308,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 543 and 546 together.<\/p><p>A total of 33,481 apprentices were registered from 1<sup><\/sup>Jan 2015 to 31 August 2021.  3,801 apprentices withdrew from apprenticeships between 2015 and 2020.

risk that some students receive grant payments for which they are not eligible, including for reasons beyond the direct control of SUSI.  <\/p><p>To mitigate the risk of overpayments, SUSI implements

A High Court case, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, resulted in significant delays in 2019, and the loss of over six months processing time. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted on staff attendance in the office over the last 18 months and a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during this time.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, regrettably, the current average processing time for applications is 23 months and there are just over 22,200 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are \"ceremony ready\". <\/p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions.  However, the combined impact of the 2019 Jones judgment and the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the processing timeline for standard applications increasing. <\/p>  <p>  Aside from these specific issues, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with my Department. <\/p>  <p>  In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.   <\/p>  <p>  For applicants that were in the final stages of processing, in January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, my Department has delivered on its commitment to communicate with 6,500 applicants by the end of June, inviting them to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. <\/p>  <p>  As of 15 September 2021, 6,167 certificates of naturalisation have been issued so far this year and a further 1,000 people have paid the statutory fee and will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  The Citizenship Division of my Department has prioritised bringing the oldest applications on hand to conclusion and a significant number of these applicants have received their certificates of naturalisation since the introduction of the temporary process.<\/p>  <p>  Since 13 September, the staff of the Citizenship Division of my Department have returned to the office on a new attendance pattern that will see a gain of approximately 500 production hours per week due to increased footfall on-site. To further address the volume of applications on hand, additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. <\/p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on this, my objective is to achieve an improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800087#WRY05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1383,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800087#WRY05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1384,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[46205\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800087#WRY05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 533 of 15 September 2021, if tenders for the courses and training provided were issued; if so, the persons who responded; the criteria by which the course provider was ultimately chosen; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1385,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to supporting the development of all its staff in line with our HR Strategy and the wider People Strategy for the civil service, and looks for opportunities to support and invest in its people.

This general scheme was developed to deliver on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI) following publication of its fundamental in-depth review in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  A central tenet of the CoFPI report is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be a single organisation with a single workforce. To support this, CoFPI recommended that non-sworn members (i.e. Garda staff) should be recruited directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not to the general civil service, and should be treated as valued members of a single Garda workforce with a shared mission. <\/p>  <p>  The general scheme gives effect to this recommendation by providing for the Garda Commissioner to recruit and appoint Garda staff in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. Under the provisions of the general scheme, the Minister may also designate by order that existing civil servants within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will change status, but only after engagement with trade unions and staff associations. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that no changes to the status of existing Garda staff will take place solely as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation.  A Ministerial order will be required before any designation to change the civil servant status of existing Garda staff may be made. The Minister must engage with any trade union or staff association concerned and consider any representations made by them. The general scheme provides for further reassurances on the terms and conditions of existing Garda staff prior to any agreement being reached with relevant unions or associations.

The Act contains measures recommended by the Steering Group Report on a Substance Misuse Strategy to address both the volume of alcohol consumed in Ireland and harmful patterns of alcohol consumption such as binge drinking. Harmful drinking patterns have particular impacts on young people with evidence showing that binge drinking impacts on the developing brain.   <\/p>  <p>  Pricing is one of the most effective interventions to address harmful patterns of drinking especially among young people.   <\/p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 (Sale and Supply of Alcohol Products) Regulations 2020 came into operation in January this year. These regulations have restricted price promotions in relation to alcohol products. Measures in the regulations include the prohibition of the sale of an alcohol product at a reduced price for a limited period and the prohibition of the sale of an alcohol product at a reduced price because that product is sold with another product or service.     <\/p>  <p>  In May of this year, I commenced section 11 of the Act on Minimum Unit Pricing. It will come into operation from 4 January 2022 and sets a minimum price of 10c per gram of alcohol. Minimum pricing is effective at addressing the harms associated with alcohol as international evidence shows that heavier drinkers tend to purchase cheaper alcohol than lighter drinkers. In addition, the introduction of a 10c minimum price will ensure that strong alcohol products are not cheaply available for children and young people.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally in November this year, two sections of the Act relating to alcohol advertising and alcohol sponsorship will become operational. The purpose of these provisions is to reduce the visibility of alcohol in daily life, particularly for children. Those provisions are:<\/p>  <p>  - A prohibition on alcohol advertising on a sports area during a sporting event, at events aimed at children or at events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children.<\/p>  <p>  - A prohibition on alcohol sponsorship of events aimed at children, events which the majority of participants or competitors are children and events involving driving or racing motor vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800090#WRBB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Control Measures","counter":1552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800090#WRBB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1553,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[46044\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800090#WRBB03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures being taken to tackle youth smoking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1554,"content":"<p>The Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study 2018 found that 5 percent of children aged 10 to 17 smoke, a decline of 3 percent on the 2014 figure.

This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Ivermectin.  <\/p>  <p>  As confirmed by HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group (www.hiqa.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-02\/Interventions-to-prevent-progression_Advice.pdf), evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on Ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of Ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of Ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4 February 2021 published a statement including the following:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:<\/p>  <p>  - No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;<\/p>  <p>  - No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;<\/p>  <p>  - A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.<\/p>  <p>  We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of Ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  Further research was undertaken by HIQA and updated advice was provided to the NPHET on 12 May: COVID-19 - Interventions and health related factors that prevent infection or minimise progression to severe disease. This document was subsequently published by HIQA on the 23 June 2021: <\/p>  <p>  www.hiqa.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-06\/Advice-to-NPHET_Interventions-to-prevent-COVID-19.pdf <\/p>  <p>  One of the key findings of the review was that Ivermectin is not currently licensed for the treatment of COVID-19. From this evidence summary, there is currently insufficient information on whether it can be safely used to prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Ivermectin should therefore not be used as prophylaxis outside well-designed, regulated clinical trials as the benefits and harms are not yet clear when taken in the context of COVID-19 treatment. <\/p>  <p>  Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up, different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention outside of well conducted, well-regulated clinical trials. Furthermore, no evidence was identified for the effectiveness or safety of any non-pharmaceutical interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800091#WRCC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive","counter":1606,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800091#WRCC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1607,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[46110\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800091#WRCC03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE has returned to full ICT functionality;

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that the Act, in its current form, did not place caps on the financial assessment of family owned and operated farms or businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care. This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family. These changes were mad through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill, which was signed into law by the President 22 July 2021 and will come into effect 90 days later, on the 20 October 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The principal amendment introduced under the Act extended the three-year cap on contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where an appointed family successor commits to working the productive asset for a period of 6 years. To be considered for the 3-year cap, the legislation requires that an asset owned by an applicant for the Scheme or recently transferred to a family member is a productive family asset that has been actively worked by a family member for a significant period of time in advance of the person entering care.<\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of calculating the three-year period after which contributions will be capped under the amendment, time already spent in care when the amendment comes into force will be taken into account. This means that a person who entered nursing home care three or more years ago should be able to benefit from the relief under the amendment when it comes into force, provided they can meet the other conditions.<\/p>  <p>  However, the amendment does not provide for any retrospective relief or refunds on contributions to care made before the amendment comes into operation. Retrospective application of the proposed legislative changes would create a challenging precedent, involving high legal and administrative costs and risks, in attempting to apply retrospectively a complex set of conditions. It would also introduce a degree of inequity where conditions would be imposed in the past, with only some people in a position to satisfy those &ndash; as then unknown &ndash; conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Nursing Home Support Scheme Office has been involved throughout the development of the legislation as the responsible operational body. Appropriate training and updated guidance is being provided to staff involved in administering the scheme, and necessary changes to IT systems are being implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800091#WRCC05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Eating Disorders","counter":1627,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800091#WRCC05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[46134\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800091#WRCC05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons currently awaiting residential services and treatment with respect to the national clinical programme for eating disorders;

These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my department that they have approved 7 Outpatient ophthalmology initiatives and 1 See &amp;amp; Treat initiative for funding so far in 2021, which will facilitate treatment for 11,749 patients on ophthalmology waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  In order to address waiting lists in the immediate-short term the Department of Health, HSE, and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are finalising a waiting list Action Plan which will be in operation until the end of 2021. The Action plan will focus on addressing the backlog arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and the HSE cyber-attack. A longer term Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is an essential part of the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan approved by Government in May the year, is also currently being finalised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800092#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800092#WRDD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[46144\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800092#WRDD00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the HSE will resume in-person breastfeeding support groups.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800092#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800092#WRDD00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1645,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[46147\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800092#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that elective surgeries have been cancelled at University Hospital Kerry since 9 September 2021 with no plan to resume them;

This funding will be used to develop and broaden the range of peer-led, mutual aid and family support programmes in accordance with best practice.

Services will be networked and co-ordinated along standardised pathways to ensure that the right care is delivered in the right place at the right time.   <\/p>  <p>  Before recommending the designation of the Mater Hospital as the Major Trauma Centre for the Central Trauma Network, the Health Service Executive (HSE) undertook a clear and objective process to inform the recommendation for the designation.  This included the appointment of an Independent Assessment Panel, containing members expert in the retrieval and acute management of trauma patients, including those patients with head injuries.   The panel used a designation framework, which included service specifications and criteria to assess submissions from Hospital Groups.  This Framework had been subject to a public consultation, which allowed the HSE to meet with key stakeholders and gave interested parties an opportunity to seek further clarity on the service specifications and the designation criteria.  The recommendation to designate the Mater Hospital as the Major Trauma Centre for the Central Trauma Network was approved by Government in April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The clear objective of the National Trauma Strategy is for all trauma patients to access the treatments they need in a timely manner.  This will be possible through the establishment of two Major Trauma Centres that have all trauma specialties, including neurosurgery.  The availability of all trauma specialties in one hospital will create very significant benefits for patients, including a reduced need for a secondary transfer, as well as reduced waiting times between sequential surgeries. As such, the National Trauma Office in the HSE is engaging closely with neurosurgeons with a view to them assisting in the planning of neurosurgical services in the Major Trauma Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1817,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1818,"qnumday":713,"qnumall":"[46252\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the suspension of BreastCheck screening services over the pandemic; and if a breakdown will be provided of cancelled appointments by CHO area in tabular form.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1819,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services","counter":1820,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1821,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[46253\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of dentists that were registered for the dental treatment support scheme in each of the years 2016 to 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1822,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1824,"qnumday":715,"qnumall":"[46254\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800095#WRGG01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of registered complaints and or cases taken against dentists by medical card holders and non-medical card holders, respectively in each of the years 2016 to 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1825,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is not held by my Department.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021\/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care Services","counter":1915,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1916,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[46379\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be allocated a full-time residential place.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1917,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1919,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[46380\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of support networks for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1920,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1921,"content":"<p>Question No. 747 answered with Question No. 611.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1922,"content":"<p>Question No. 748 answered with Question No. 611.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":1923,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1924,"qnumday":749,"qnumall":"[46430\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800096#WRHH04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the terms of reference for the three-year review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 will be published; if a company or organisation has or will be commissioned to deal with the service user and service provider strands of the review; if a company has been appointed or chosen, the name of the organisation; the terms of reference it has been given; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1925,"content":"<p>The review of the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is being progressed this year, in line with statutory and Government commitments.\u00a0Under section 7 of the Act, the review must be initiated by January 2022.\u00a0It will comprise a three-part approach to appraise the operation of the Act, with strands focusing on service users, service providers and a public consultation. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An independent expert will be appointed to lead the review.

This comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a wide range of practices, including domestic altruistic surrogacy, as well as: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The legislation also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR. <\/p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). <\/p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions. As issues relating to international surrogacy concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments, my Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of this policy area. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that publication of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. Officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General continue to prioritise the drafting of this complex legislation and will engage intensively over the next few months to finalise the Bill. Subject to certain criteria being met, AHR treatment will be available to people irrespective of gender, marital status or sexual orientation. Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight. <\/p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (the Act of 2015) reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types. The Minister for Health is responsible for Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 and these Parts commenced on 4 May 2020. Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 deal with the issue of donor-assisted human reproduction. <\/p>  <p>  Subject to certain conditions, the provisions of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 provide for the parentage of donor-conceived children born after the commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 and retrospective declarations of parentage for donor-conceived children born prior to the commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3. <\/p>  <p>  On a broad level, issues related to legal guardianship &ndash; including responsibility for the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 &ndash; come under the remit of the Minister for Justice. Specifically, section 6B of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by the Act of 2015, provides for the guardianship of donor-conceived children to whom Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 apply. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, matters concerning social welfare payments are the responsibility of the Minister of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800098#WRKK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":2026,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800098#WRKK03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2027,"qnumday":784,"qnumall":"[46610\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800098#WRKK03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will facilitate a meeting with a family (details supplied) in County Kildare given the ongoing issues for the family and the previous correspondence between the HSE and officials in his office.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2028,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800098#WRKK03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2029,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800098#WRKK03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2030,"qnumday":785,"qnumall":"[46612\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800098#WRKK04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when appointments will be arranged in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2031,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two Outpatient Department and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght campuses, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes and the Employment Order. In addition, there remain risks beyond the control of the Development Board and the contractor, arising from Brexit, the global pandemic, global supply chain difficulties and shortages of construction raw materials. However, the contractor is working hard to mitigate those risks where possible. <\/p>  <p>  Since the commencement of the NCH project construction, just under &euro;805m has been drawn down for  works on the project across the three sites.<\/p>  <p>  Definitive updates on outturn costs cannot be provided due to the fact that there is a live contract in place and speculation on any costs would be detrimental to the Development Board&rsquo;s commercial engagements.<\/p>  <p>  Despite delays, the new children&rsquo;s hospital building at St James&rsquo;s is taking shape. The concrete frame was completed at the end of March which reaches the highest point in the building. This &lsquo;topping out&rsquo; is an important milestone in any construction project.  The fa&ccedil;ade to the building will be practically complete and weathertight by the end of 2021 and the internal fit-out of a range of clinical areas is progressing well. <\/p>  <p>  The second paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght Hospital was substantially completed in early September 2021, in line with the contractor&rsquo;s programme schedule, and then handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland on 15 September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The new facility is expected to open in mid-November after a period of operational commissioning and equipping. This will further drive the shift towards ambulatory care provision. Together with the Urgent Care Centre, CHI at Connolly, these new facilities will improve access to urgent care for a significant number of paediatric patients. The opening of the second of the three new campuses, will mark another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800099#WRLL04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2095,"qnumday":812,"qnumall":"[46722\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800099#WRLL04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to reports of anti-social behaviour, fires or pipe bombs on the site of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital; and if antisocial behaviour is having an impact on the construction of the hospital.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2096,"content":"<p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has advised my Department of a number of incidents that have arisen on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.

Having spoken with the individual concerned, I understand that this arose from his purchase of an unstable fishing vessel in the Netherlands in 2007, essentially a private commercial transaction between two contracting parties to purchase a vessel. The responsibility for ensuring the authenticity of the details, specifications and stability of the vessel being purchased rested with the purchaser.<\/p>  <p>  The core issue here relates to the safety and safety certification of the vessel purchased.  The safety of fishing vessels and safety certification, including matters relating to stability, is the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has no function in relation to the safety certification of Fishing vessels or matters arising in relation to their stability. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Programme is the principal source of development funding for our seafood sector.  The Programme is implemented under the provisions of the EMFF Regulation (508\/2014) which specifies to what purposes funds can be granted.  There is no particular provision of the EMFF Regulation that would facilitate an ex-gratia payment to assist in the case raised by the Deputy.  Furthermore, it is not possible to provide a grant for the decommissioning of the vessel concerned, as under the terms of the EMFF Regulation, decommissioning is not permitted after 31 December 2018.  A new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) Regulation (2021\/1139) for the 2021- 27 period was enacted in July 2021 and my Department is preparing a new corresponding Seafood Development Programme, which should be in operation next year.  However, similar to the EMFF Regulation, the new EMFAF only permits decommissioning of fishing vessels for very specific purposes concerned with addressing an identified imbalance in a particular fleet segment and only allows decommissioning of active fishing vessels and so is unlikely to be relevant to the case identified by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800101#WRNN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":2169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800101#WRNN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2170,"qnumday":839,"qnumall":"[45959\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092800101#WRNN02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a payment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2171,"content":"<p>The person named applied for the 2021 Basic Payment and Areas of Natural Constraints scheme on 1st  May 2021.<\/p><p>All necessary up-dates to the area claimed by the person named under these scheme have been completed by the Department and the advance payment under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme has now been processed.

In Budget 2021, provision was made for the introduction of a dairy beef pilot programme.  The objective of the pilot programme which was launched in April 2021, is to both build on the gains of previous BEEP schemes in terms of weight\/performance recording, and to facilitate further integration of the dairy and beef systems, by providing support for farmers who are rearing progeny from the dairy herd. <\/p>  <p>  Another initiative aimed at creating greater integration between the beef and dairy systems is the development of the Dairy Beef Index (DBI).  This was developed by ICBF to promote high quality beef cattle bred from the dairy herd, while maintaining optimal dairy traits.   As the data set underpinning this index increases, so does the reliability and usefulness of the index to farmers as a decision making tool and as a mechanism to provide greater integration between dairy and beef systems. With the development of the ICBF&rsquo;s Dairy Beef Index,  data from ICBF show that genetic trends for beef traits have improved for beef sires, reassuring farmers that these beef-dairy calves have improved beef potential.<\/p>  <p>  A support for a dairy beef calf welfare has been proposed as part of the development of Ireland's CAP strategic plan (CSP).
