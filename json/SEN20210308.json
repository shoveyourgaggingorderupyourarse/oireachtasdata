We need change and this has been proven by: the Equality Tribunal in 2014; the 2016 Higher Education Authority, HEA, review of gender and equality; the Gender Action Plan 2018-2020; and the gender equality task force.  Across our seven universities only one out of all is a woman because, in September 2020, Professor Kerstin Mey was appointed as interim president for the University of Limerick.<\/p> <p>Many of our institutes of technology are on their way to technological university status.  Two out of nine presidents or provosts are women: Dr. Orla Flynn is the president of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology; and Dr. Patricia Mulcahy is president of the Institute of Technology Carlow.<\/p> <p>I am also happy to note that all three institutes under the Connacht-Ulster Alliance technological university have applied for the bronze Athena SWAN award and the results are due at the end of March.  The Athena SWAN committee is an international body for gender equality, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, areas in higher education institutes.  There is also a recent publication by Professor Pat O'Connor, University of Limerick, and Dr. Gemma Irvine, vice-president for equality and diversity at Maynooth University.  Their publication points to the fact that an Athena SWAN award, particularly at silver level, is bound to be associated with a higher ranking on the  Quacquarelli Symonds, QS, world university rankings system.  However, an Athena SWAN award alone will not increase the number of women in professorships.  The former Minister, Mary Mitchell-O'Connor, was proactive and set up the senior academic leadership initiative, SALI, that has 45 new female professorships, of which 20 were allocated in 2019 and 15 more are due to be announced in May with two being allocated to the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, and one to the Athlone Institute of Technology.  GMIT has applied for two posts in this year's round.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How on earth are we to reach the target of 40% of professorships being held by females by 2024 when only 26% are so held right now?

It is good to see acts of collegiality and solidarity between female Members of the Oireachtas who are, after all, a minority.<\/p> <p>Regarding the Commencement matter, it is important to allow everybody to flourish and to give people the opportunity to flourish in their fields, regardless of their sex or gender.  I support the principles of equality of opportunity and egalitarianism.  If women aspire to pursue a career in academia or research, they should be encouraged and supported in doing so.  There should be no barriers to women entering the world of academia and research and no glass ceilings.  I would, however, voice a note of caution about going too far down the road of social engineering, positive discrimination, gender quotas and equality of outcome.  Surely, we want talent to be selected on merit.  It would be awful to have people regarded as a mere token, as simply being there to fill a quota or as having been hired to allow an employer to signal virtue or for a person to be given a post because there is a financial incentive for the employer or institution in question.

While we have made significant progress in recent years, we have a lot more to do.  Higher education legislation requires institutions to promote gender balance among students and staff and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to promote the attainment of equality of opportunity.<\/p> <p>The 2016 report of the expert group on gender equality and the 2018 gender equality task force report encompass a suite of initiatives to bring about sustainable organisational change and to empower a culture of gender equality at all levels in all our institutions among all staff, including academic and professional staff, management and support staff.  These initiatives would lead to a more equal system in which a person&rsquo;s gender was not a barrier to career progression.  The HEA monitors institutional performance and is included as a key focus in the performance framework.<\/p> <p>One of the recommendations in the 2018 gender equality task force&rsquo;s action plan was that a Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality be established.  This was established in the HEA in 2019 and now also covers diversity and inclusion.  The centre ensures an acceleration towards gender equality and is a key enabler in ensuring sustainable change by providing centralised support for the institutions, facilitating the sharing of good practice and funding innovative organisational and cultural change initiatives nationally.<\/p> <p>In 2019, the senior academic leadership initiative was launched by the Department to assist in accelerating gender balance at senior levels through the award of 45 gender-targeted senior academic leadership posts over three years. <\/p> <p>In 2020, an annual gender equality enhancement fund was established by the HEA centre of excellence to encourage cross-sectoral collaboration as a means to achieve national transformation.  The centre uses this fund to encourage innovative approaches to addressing gender inequality across the institutions.<\/p> <p>The Athena SWAN charter is a framework used across the globe to support and transform gender equality in higher education and research.  Engagement with the charter is a key pillar of our national strategy for gender equality in higher education.  The charter was launched in Ireland in 2015 with a specific remit to encourage and recognise commitment to advancing the careers of women in higher education.  As of the end of 2020, a total of 56 Athena SWAN bronze awards were held by Irish higher education institutions including 14 awards for institutions and 42 for departments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Athena SWAN award achievement is a requirement for research funding eligibility from the three main research funding agencies, the Irish Research Council, IRC, the Health Research Board, HRB, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.

In light of these requirements, HEIs stand to lose access to research funding from the IRC, HRB and SFI if they do not achieve Athena SWAN awards within the set timeframe.<\/p><p>The IRC is working with the HEA and other research funders on issues of gender equality and the implementation of the gender action plan 2018 to 2020.  The council was among the first research funders globally to gender-blind applicants to its research funding programmes.  For assessment panels, the IRC targets gender parity in the composition of such panels, at minimum of no less than 40% of each gender.  The council monitors gender balance in applications and awards annually.

This is not just because of the unsightly nature of it but because we are now very aware of the knock-on impacts plastics have on all manner of wildlife.  When I worked on the EU single use plastic directive, we were told that period products are the fifth most common item found in marine litter and that on average a person who menstruates will use on average 150 kg of tampons, pads and applicators in their lifetime.  However, the approach favoured by the EU was not to regulate the manufacturers.  It was not to insist that as a bare minimum they print on the packet the amount of plastic contained in their products, which is on average 90% of the contents.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Instead the EU wanted to impose an environmental tax on period products.  I strongly resisted this.  Why should women be made pay the cost of cleaning up what is an essential product to their everyday lives, while manufacturers make huge profits?  The disposable period product industry is worth &pound;265 million per year in Britain alone.  The period product industry deliberately chose to push women into purchasing disposable products as it is a far better business model to have women come back every month rather than every couple of years, or in the case of menstrual cups, every five to ten years.<\/p><p>It is estimated that only 5% of the population are using reusable products.  This is down to many factors, including a lack of awareness of their existence, which can be addressed through public awareness campaigns.  A second factor in the lack of use of sustainable products is their low visibility.  Supermarket shelves are dominated with disposables because it suits the manufacturers' business model and many have preferential contracts with supermarkets.<\/p><p>However, the biggest barrier to widespread uptake of sustainable period products is their cost.  Reusables are not appropriate in many circumstances, especially for vulnerable groups such as women who are homeless or living in precarious situations without access to their own bathrooms.  However, cost is preventing a large proportion of the menstruating population from accessing sustainable products.  One simple measure that could be taken would be to reduce the VAT rate on those products.<\/p><p>Currently, standard period products are 0% VAT while reusable products such as period underwear and menstrual cups are 13.5%.  I am aware that EU rules prevent us reducing the VAT to 0%.  However, it is interesting that products relating to a normal bodily function that affects women are on a higher VAT rate than going to a restaurant or pub and a rate almost three times that of trading a greyhound.  It shows a bizarre set of priorities when it comes to women's health and protection of the environment.<\/p><p>Even more disturbing is that incontinence pads are taxed at the highest rate of VAT, which has increased to 23% as of 1 March.  The rate of VAT on incontinence products is yet another example of regressive tax that disproportionately affects women.  Incontinence is not a luxury.  It affects women far more than men.  It is estimated that as many as one in five women over 40 is affected by some level of incontinence and up to 70% of expectant and new mothers are affected.<\/p><p>I ask for a commitment that incontinence pads and sustainable period products have their VAT levels reduced to the minimum level possible.  What measures have been taken to change EU rules to provide for 0% VAT on all period and incontinence products?  Can the Minister of State give me a commitment that the Government will consider rolling out a similar scheme to that in Scotland where free samples of reusable products were offered alongside a public awareness campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#D00500","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue this morning.  I listened carefully to everything she said.  The Senator seems to be knowledgeable of VAT regulations in Ireland and the UK and  I want to thank her for the excellent presentation of the case.  However, as the Senator may be aware, Ireland is the only country in the EU that applies a 0% VAT rate to period products such as tampons and sanitary towels.  This rate was applied in 1991 and we have been able to maintain this rate under the provisions of the VAT directive that allow for a 0% rate to be maintained if it applied in 1991.  I am sure the Senator is aware of that.<\/p> <p>A number of new products have come on the market since then, which have attracted a standard rate of VAT.  The period poverty working group lead by the Department of Health as part of the national strategy for women and girls published a report on period poverty on 8 February 2021.  It recommended a reduced VAT rate be applied to certain newer period products in circumstances in which a 0% VAT rate cannot be applied.  It also recommended that Ireland continue negotiations at EU level to allow for a 0% VAT rate to apply to all period products.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to say that following the passage of the Finance Bill, new period products in question have had a reduced VAT rate applied to them as of 1 January 2021.  The VAT rate directive provides for the application of a reduced of VAT to such products in paragraph 3 of annexe 1.  I understand that before introducing the change officials ensured that the reduced rate applying to newer period products would not risk the 0% VAT rate on tampons and sanitary towels, which are far more common, and have attracted the 0% rate because it applied in 1991 and that still holds.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I can confirm that Ireland and a number of other EU member states are looking for greater flexibility in the VAT directive to allow a zero rate to be applied to these new period products.

We are seeking greater flexibility on this.  A number of other states are assisting but it will have to be agreed by every member state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#E00200","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I welcome the VAT rate was reduced but it is still higher than the 9% VAT rate on restaurants, pubs and the hospitality sector and three times higher than the rate for trading animals.  Our priorities need to be reflected.<\/p> <p>Regarding incontinence pads, it must be an oversight the fact they are in the luxury category.  That should be addressed.

I will take on board, and take back to the Department of Finance, the issue of the luxury rate on incontinence pads.  I know they can be a very heavy cost for many families.  We all know, through our work as local public representatives, community nurses regularly provide substantial amounts of incontinence pads, through the HSE, to patients in their areas that require them.  However, we all hear locally they can sometimes be rationed.  Some people are provided with incontinence pads through the HSE.<\/p> <p>Period products such as menstrual cups, pants and sponges, previously at the standard VAT rate, were reduced to 13.5% on 1 January 2021.  The Senator rightly asked why they were not reduced to the 9% applied to the hospitality sector.  People understand that the VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% in the hospitality sector was a temporary response to support those facing serious economic difficulties due to Covid-19.  It is only a temporary measure and the plan is that the rate will go back to 13.5%.  It was strictly a Covid measure for those particular businesses.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that the rate of VAT applied relates to the type of product rather than whether it is sustainable.  That is a broad issue we will all have to raise at European level.  This means that sustainable sanitary towels and more environmentally friendly tampons still have a zero rate applied to them.  It is very important to say that.

It is perhaps fitting that I now ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Health to review plans for the national maternity hospital, take steps to ensure the hospital has full public ownership and accountability, and ensure the land it is built on is owned by the State and not subject to a limited period lease, which could compromise the provision of maternity and reproductive healthcare for future generations.<\/p> <p>This State has a sad history of failing women when it comes to maternal and reproductive health, from symphysiotomy to CervicalCheck, and transferring power to religious charities when it comes to pregnant women.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We were painfully reminded of the consequences of that abdication of responsibility by the recent appalling report on mother and baby homes.<\/p><p>This power has been tightly held.  When Dr. No&euml;l Browne attempted to introduce the mother and child scheme, it was blocked by religious pressure.  Just last year, the State was in the unacceptable position of waiting to hear if the Vatican would give permission to the Sisters of Charity regarding a proposed site for a new national maternity hospital.  When that permission came, it had conditions.  Despite headlines about gifting the land to the people of Ireland, it emerged that it had not been given to the State, but transferred to a trust, St. Vincent's Holdings, from which the State would lease the land for a period of just 99 years.  Dr. Peter Boylan has spoken about how the board of the national maternity hospital has been told that the deal is complex and not a regular deal, the documents will not be regular and there will be a plethora of different structures and ownerships.  Religious orders have become proficient in the shifting of assets and accountability through complex company structures, but this does not mean that they lose sight of long-term ownership and control.  The new charitable trust's constitution, lodged with the Companies Registration Office last August, is similar to the constitution of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Clause 5.11 specifies that the directors may hold, sell, manage, lease or mortgage any or all of the parts of the company's property.  This is a major hostage to fortune.<\/p><p>Why would any trust, charitable or not, have control of any kind over our national maternity hospital?  Why is this trust allowed to lease the land to the State instead of selling or giving it?  Why is the State diluting its responsibilities again?  The Sisters of Charity, whose documented role in illegal adoptions has been a subject of recent public outrage, last week called for an investigation into that matter dating back to 1922.  If they can ask us to investigate mistakes made 99 years ago, I will ask the Minister of State to look forward 99 years, which is the proposed length of the lease.  That is not very long.  We are talking about our children's children's children.  We will spend millions of euro on a hospital, then the lease will expire and maternal and reproductive healthcare will suddenly be up for negotiation again.  We are in a different Ireland.  It is even different than it was for the 2016 Mulvey report.  The people of our country have broken their silence and taken back control of women's reproductive rights.  The State has had to apologise time and again for how it failed women in the past.  Let it learn from that and not make bad compromises that will fail the women of the future.<\/p><p>At a time when EU fiscal rules are suspended and 0% loans are available, there is no financial justification for giving our national maternity hospital to a charitable trust.  I call on the Minister of State to deliver something better.  Commit to a review of the plans and take steps, including a compulsory purchase order if necessary, to ensure full public control, public accountability and public ownership of our national maternity hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#F00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I wish everyone a happy International Women's Day.

It should be acknowledged that the national maternity hospital project is unprecedented and inherently complex, given that we are relocating one voluntary hospital onto the campus of another voluntary hospital to a hospital building owned by the State.  Therefore, a legal framework is being developed to protect the State's investment in the new national maternity hospital and to ensure that the hospital remains in State ownership.<\/p> <p>The hospital will be built on the site leased from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  I am satisfied that its development on a site with a leasehold interest of 99 years and rights of renewal will not in any way compromise the provision of maternity care for future generations.  On the contrary, by building the new hospital, we will secure maternity care for future generations of women.<\/p> <p>The corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new maternity hospital at Elm Park are encompassed in the Mulvey agreement, which was finalised following an extensive mediation process between the National Maternity Hospital and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Mulvey agreement provides for the establishment of a new company, the national maternity hospital at Elm Park DAC, which will have clinical and operational as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services.

It is important to emphasise that those overriding objectives will be copper-fastened through the legal framework.  I acknowledge that the development of the legal framework has proved to be more difficult and deliberations more protracted than originally anticipated, but I understand there has been good ongoing engagement between the key stakeholders.  I am advised it is anticipated that discussions will be concluded and the drafting of the legal documents finalised in the coming weeks.  It should be noted that once finalised, the legal framework will be brought to the Government for approval.<\/p><p>I am conscious the buildings in Holles Street are no longer fit for purpose.

Some of the main symptoms include chronic pain and fatigue, heavy bleeding, and infertility or mental health issues, to name but a few.  There are still no clear clinical guidelines for GPs and no clear care pathway through our health service.  On average, it takes women seven years to get a diagnosis, with many saying it can take them in excess of ten years.

My speech is on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, but both he and I are acutely aware that the Senators have long been advocates on this issue.  I wish to begin by emphasising that the Government is committed to promoting and improving women's health outcomes.  That commitment is spelled out very clearly in the programme for Government and has been underpinned by a provision of &euro;12 million in budget 2021 for new developments in maternity and gynaecology services.<\/p> <p>As Senator Chambers stated with regard to the current treatment of endometriosis, a general practitioner referral to a gynaecologist is the standard pathway of care for the management of this condition.  This is similar to the pathway in place for the management of other gynaecological conditions.  I am advised that all obstetricians and gynaecologists are trained in the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.<\/p> <p>The HSE national women and infants health programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services generally.  I think all present would agree on that.  The programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women for gynaecology appointments.  The plan aims to reorient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory or see-and-treat model, rather than the traditional outpatients referral model.  The new model of care involves the establishment of one-stop ambulatory gynaecology clinics.  These clinics will help to ensure that gynaecology patients receive safe and appropriate treatment, reduce the need for multiple appointments, ensure a more effective use of public funds and, ultimately, improve clinical outcomes.  The roll-out of phase 1 of the new model of care commenced last year and I am delighted to confirm that the ambulatory gynaecology clinics in Cork and Galway are now providing services, while it is anticipated that the clinics in the Rotunda Hospital and Waterford will be operational this year.  It is important to state that although I have mentioned four hospitals, that is not nearly enough by any manner or means.  With the new funding provided in budget 2021, the roll-out of the model of care will be accelerated and additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics will be established this year.<\/p> <p>Last year, the women's health task force identified several priority areas for action.  In that context, the need to improve services for women with endometriosis was recognised and included as part of a priority work stream to improve gynaecological health for women and girls.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The endometriosis work stream identified a number of potential actions in this area, including enhanced services and supports, and the potential establishment of a centre of excellence for endometriosis surgery.<\/p><p>Budget 2021 has also provided a dedicated &euro;5 million health fund to progress a programme of actions arising from the work of the health task force.  The Department of Health has engaged with the HSE to identify proposals which could be implemented in 2021 and funded through the women's health fund.  A number of proposals are being finalised with stakeholders and it is anticipated that announcements will be made in the coming weeks on the actions which will be supported by the fund.  The developments I have outlined underscore this Government's commitment to improving services for endometriosis and gynaecology more broadly.<\/p><p>However, as Senator Chambers says, one in ten is the figure, there are 30,000 on a waiting list, two hospitals are providing the service and two more are due to come on stream in 2021.

To put it another way, women stop getting paid at around 4 p.m. every day.<br\/><br\/>In other jurisdictions, gender pay gap legislation requires employers to publish disaggregated data illustrating whether a gender pay gap exists and requires them to take action where it does.  This sort of legislation has been effective in addressing the gender pay gap.  The Labour Party introduced a Bill in the previous term, namely, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017, which would have applied to all organisations with more than 50 employees.  It passed all Stages in the Seanad by 3 October 2018 and was referred to the D&aacute;il, passing Second Stage there in November 2018.  We are asking the Minister to contemplate taking on that Bill.  I am conscious that the previous Government also introduced the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019 in that term but that Bill remains languishing before the D&aacute;il.  Does this Government propose to introduce a new Bill, for which there is a commitment in the programme for Government, or will it take on our Bill or the previous Government's Bill?  Either way we want to ensure there is progress on this issue.<br\/><br\/>A piece by Mark Tighe in <i>The Sunday Times <\/i>yesterday gave a very strong indication of why this is necessary.  The publication of the pay gap figures from RT&Eacute; showed that a significant pay gap on grounds of gender still exists in RT&Eacute; three years after the initial publication of figures in 2016.  According to 2019 data, one in five women working in RT&Eacute; earns less than &euro;40,000, compared to almost one in ten men, and 63% of women there earn less than &euro;60,000, compared to just 46% of men.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#K00600","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>It is great to have the Minister in the Chamber today.  It is difficult to convey the enormity of the challenge of trying to close the gender pay gap in this country.  Senator Bacik spoke about the hourly wage gap but we all relate to weekly or monthly earnings and the average weekly earnings for women in this country are 25.05% less than the average weekly earnings of men.  That is because of the gap in hourly pay but also because more women are trapped in part-time employment.  Some 11% of men were in part-time employment in this country last year, compared to 28% of women.  When it comes to retirement, that gap gets even bigger.  We know from EUROSTAT figures that there is a 28.6% gap between the pensions of men and women.<\/p> <p>Such is the scale of the gap that not one single legislative measure will be a magic bullet.  We need a series of measures.  The legislation Senator Bacik put forward three years ago will only shine a spotlight into recruitment and progression practices within firms.  That is an important starting point and an important spotlight but it cannot be the finish line.  The game-changer in closing the gender pay gap is the right to be recognised for collective bargaining.  One might ask how that relates to women.  There is a growing body of international evidence that shows that where there are higher levels of co-ordinated bargaining within workplaces there is lower wage dispersion, and when there is lower wage dispersion there is less of an earnings gap between men and women.  The EU adequate minimum wages directive will also be hugely instrumental in allowing a framework for the right to collective bargaining in this country.  The T&aacute;naiste, along with fellow EU employment ministers, is actively trying to hobble this directive.  As a first step, we are asking the Government to get on with the legislation and then allow this directive to pass. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#L00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Bacik and Sherlock for raising this important issue today.

As the Minister with responsibility for gender equality, I am very conscious of the importance of the gender pay gap as a metric of women&rsquo;s economic empowerment relative to men&rsquo;s.  It illustrates the degree to which women&rsquo;s hourly pay, on average, is lower than men&rsquo;s during their working lives, with implications for their risk of poverty, including in later life.

Women are experiencing greater conflict between working and their family lives.  Women are more likely to have reduced working hours, suffer job loss or leave the labour market.  After earlier periods of lockdown, the female labour market has recovered at a slower pace than that of men.  If this pattern persists, it could have long-term implications for female participation and employment rates, women's career progression and women&rsquo;s pay in general.  These are all factors that are already known to impact on the existence and size of gender pay gaps.<\/p><p>Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is a key commitment in the national strategy for women and girls.  It is a multifaceted task involving a number of Departments and agencies.  Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.  This is why, in the programme for Government, we have committed to legislate to require publication of the gender pay gap in companies and the public service.  The aim of the Government&rsquo;s Gender Pay Gap Information Bill is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap and incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. <\/p><p>The Bill was published on 8 April 2019, completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage in June 2019 and was restored to the Order Paper in July 2020.  I intend to bring legislative amendments to Cabinet in the next fortnight which will allow the Bill to progress to Report Stage.  I am committed to enabling the enactment of this Bill as early as possible and I will seek to do so after the Easter recess.  I assure Senators that I view the Bill as a priority so it will languish no more.  <\/p><p>Senators may also be aware that, last week, on 4 March, the European Commission published proposals for the introduction by member states of binding pay transparency measures.  This proposal meets a commitment of the EU gender equality strategy and reflects one of the political priorities of the European Commission.  The legislative proposal focuses on two core elements of equal pay, namely, measures to ensure pay transparency for workers and employers and strengthened access to justice for victims of pay discrimination on the grounds of gender.  In particular, it would require the introduction of statutory obligations on large employers to publish information on the gender pay gap and provide for internal reporting on pay differences among female and male workers in the same category.  Employers would also be required to assess the pay of a category of workers where the gender pay gap exceeded a given threshold - 5% is proposed - and is not justifiable on objective gender-neutral factors. <\/p><p>It is envisaged that the proposal will now go to the European Parliament and Council for approval and that, once adopted, the Commission proposes that member states will have two years to transpose the directive into national law and communicate the relevant texts to the Commission.  These proposals are an important development at an EU level and will be reviewed in the context of the provisions of existing employment obligations and entitlements and the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill once that has been legislated for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#L00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for setting out so clearly the proposed timeframe.

I thank the Minister for coming to the House and wish everyone a happy International Women's Day.<\/p> <p>The most recent report to the Dublin city joint policing committee shows a marked increase in cases involving domestic violence.  On the one hand, I am pleased that if the figures to the Garda are increasing, it shows more people are reporting domestic violence.  What I believe is happening, however, is an overall increase in people suffering domestic violence and, consequently, we have an increase in the numbers supplied by the Garda.<\/p> <p>Despite it being International Women's Day, I acknowledge that domestic violence is not only a female issue.  Men, trans and non-binary people also suffer domestic violence.  While I do not know the specific statistics for Ireland, I have been privy to a number of conversations and representations that would demonstrate that a trans of non-binary person in a relationship is disproportionately vulnerable to domestic violence or intimate partner violence.<\/p> <p>Based on the figures I do know, women are statistically more likely to be attacked and abused repeatedly in their own home, more likely to be subjected to abuse and coercive control, and more likely to be killed by their partner or former partner.  This is not news and I welcome the steady increase in funding we have seen over recent years.  The response, certainly during Covid, has been very impressive and welcome, and the most recent budget has been fantastic as well.  However, no matter how good we are doing and how much our funding is being increased, if it is not being targeted and is not being monitored, reviewed and constantly assessed, we are not doing enough to ensure it is going where it should be and that it is being targeted at the right groups.  Do we look into our souls and believe we are doing enough?  I congratulate the Minister on all that has been done, but until we start seeing figures drop, there is always much more to do and we will never have done enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#N00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The pandemic has had devastating consequences for women and children living in fear within their own homes.  Across our State, the silence from homes where abuse is taking place is deafening.  We know that connection to community and visibility helps to prevent incidents of domestic violence, and the environment created by this pandemic has been a breeding ground for an escalation in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Homes should be places of refuge and instead they are frequently places of fear.  On International Women's Day I think of all of those women who we cannot see who live in daily fear.<\/p><p>The programme for government was the first to call out domestic violence as an epidemic.  Little did we know that things would only get worse over the last year.  In Galway domestic disputes for which no cause is noted in the joint policing committee report went up by 40%.  Breeches of barring orders went up by 25%.  An increase of &euro;4.7 million to &euro;30 million was committed to in Budget 2021 to deal with this epidemic, with &euro;2 million to help support services during the Covid crisis.  I am aware the Minister has also committed to domestic abuse leave.  An audit of the segmentation of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence responsibilities across the Departments was also committed to, along with the development of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I would like the Minister to outline the progress of these to date and how it aligns with our commitments under the Istanbul Convention.  I also want to hear about progress of the implementation of the O&rsquo;Malley report in addressing the fact that many feel retraumatised by our court system.<\/p><p>I thank all of those services which have continued to operate, including Cope Galway, Galway Rape Crisis Centre and Domestic Violence Response.  This is an epidemic that affects women and children more than men, although men should not be forgotten.  I am reminded of a lecture once given by Margaret Atwood in which, and I paraphrase, she said that perhaps the source of men&rsquo;s fear of women is a fear of being embarrassed, but women fear men because they fear being killed.  For too many women in our country this second part of her comment rings true.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank Senators Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly and Seery Kearney for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to respond.  Again, it is particularly apposite that we are discussing this issue on International Women's Day.<\/p><p>As the Senators noted, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence can occur in many different forms and can be experienced by any one of us but it is indisputable that girls and women are disproportionately affected by such acts.  The Minister for Justice has lead responsibility for co-ordinating policy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence but ensuring an effective infrastructure to respond to it is also a very significant priority for my Department.  I am actively working with the Minister for Justice to fulfil the commitment in the programme for Government to conduct an audit of the segmentation of responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence across Departments and agencies.  This audit is under way and I am hopeful that it will shortly provide us with proposals on the required infrastructure to ensure all issues with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are dealt with in the most effective and holistic manner possible.  We really need to provide the best service to those who need this type of support.  <\/p><p>Tusla, which falls within the remit of my Department, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It provides funding for about 60 organisations across the country, including those providing emergency refuge for adults and children fleeing domestic violence, 16 rape crisis centres and a range of community-based domestic violence supports.  In 2021, I increased Tusla's allocation for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence by &euro;4.7 million to a total of &euro;30 million, &euro;28 million of which is core funding for the services, while a further &euro;2 million is Covid contingency funding to help address the increased demand referred to by both Senators with regard to the pandemic.  This is a very significant increase in core funding and indicates the real importance that this Government places on this issue.<\/p><p>Investments in recent years have seen the roll-out of child-centred services for younger victims of domestic and sexual violence.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly will know about the Barnahus pilot project in Galway for child and adolescent victims of sexual violence.  It is a very positive development and we plan to expand this service to locations in Dublin and Cork as well. <\/p><p>Last December, I got Cabinet agreement to commence a process to introduce paid domestic violence leave and benefit.  Consultations on this proposal are ongoing.  I spoke with trade unions and employers' groups about this issue last week and I will bring forward proposals to Cabinet by the end of the year.  <\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney raises a particular report with regard to Garda statistics in the Dublin South Central area.  Tusla has advised me that almost &euro;1.5 million of the &euro;4.7 million additional funding is being directed to services in the greater Dublin area - Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare.  Tusla has also advised me that additional domestic violence outreach services are being rolled out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and County Wicklow to enhance supports for both women and children experiencing domestic violence, with additional outreach planned to come on stream in the Dublin South Central area.  The number of Safe Home accommodation units with support services in Dublin will reach 20 in 2021, which is an increase of 13 from last year.  Tusla has provided additional resources to the national 24-7 domestic violence and sexual violence helplines, which are operated by Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly referred to COPE Galway.  It opened a new and improved domestic violence refuge in the city supported by Tusla.  Saoirse Women&rsquo;s Refuge also opened a new refuge in the south Dublin area in early 2020.  <\/p><p>Both Senators will be aware that Tusla is currently undertaking a review of emergency accommodation, which will consider the current level of provision and the configuration of accommodation that may be needed.  It is the intention that this review will inform decisions around future investment in refuge accommodation for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#N00400","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Government has identified this epidemic and is going to address it.  There are four major areas besides all the other items that Senator O'Reilly mentioned, including the additional funding - we are going to continue that through each budget - and the audit of responsibility.

The painting being unveiled in the Seanad today is entitled <i>Her Surrender<\/i>by Leitrim artist, Sinead Guckian.  It symbolises the all too frequent airbrushing of the contribution of women from Irish history.  Nurse Elizabeth O'Farrell was the woman who carried P&aacute;draig Pearse's message seeking the end to hostilities during the 1916 Rising.

I thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating a number of Commencement matters this morning on issues pertinent to female members of our society.  It was good to have such strong debate in the Seanad this morning.<\/p> <p>The first issue I wish to raise is that of women's healthcare in this country.  We have touched upon certain aspects of it over the course of the past two weeks in particular and, this morning, Senator McGreehan again raised the issue of endometriosis.  There are many areas of women's healthcare that are far behind where they need to be, including maternity care, incontinence services, menopause, endometriosis and many other areas of women's healthcare that need additional support and direct funding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those areas need additional support and direct funding and, in that line, I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate with the Minister for Health specifically around the area of the new women's health task force.  We should hear from the Minister what he and the task force plan to do to address the clear deficiencies in the provision of women's healthcare in this country.  We have a long way to go in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I will raise another matter on which a debate would be pertinent.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications today announced a consultation with EirGrid on the future of Ireland's electricity system.  That exciting public consultation will take place over a 14-week period.  I particularly like the idea that we might look to rebalance things across the regions and that, for example, data centres would be asked or encouraged by the Government to locate in areas where the grid is not under pressure.  That would mean such centres not locating in the east of the country, as they have been doing, but coming to, for example, the west of Ireland.  My county of Mayo would be happy to welcome new investment in energy.  There is plenty of space and that would be a welcome initiative in rebalancing investment and growth across the regions.  It would be interesting to hear directly from the Minister about that consultation process and what plans he has for the future of our country's electricity system as we aim to achieve 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  It is an ambitious, high but achievable target.  The House would welcome a debate on the matter.<br\/><br\/>I listened to one of Ireland's favourite professors, Luke O'Neill, on &quot;The Pat Kenny Show&quot;<i><\/i>this morning, discussing the roll-out of vaccines.  There have been challenges, difficulties and delays in the roll-out.  The people of the country appreciate that our difficulty is supply.  We have, in some respects, little control when companies do not meet the levels of delivery they said they would.  The professor suggested that we should be exploring the Sputnik V vaccine, towards which there was a little snobbery initially.  The findings have been good in over 30 countries that have administered that vaccine.  I know that the European Medicines Agency, EMA, is looking at it.  We, as a country, should be open to all vaccines that are effective, working well and safe to use.  The priority for the Government must be to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#S00400","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Replying for the other side of the House, as it were, I wish all the women here, all the women of the world and, indeed, all of us a happy International Women's Day.

A report was published recently of the international correspondence and workings of the so-called Independent Scientific Advisory Group which has been pushing for a zero Covid approach.  Many of the members of the group are virtually household names, such is the regularity of their appearances in the media.  Its internal correspondence suggests that the group is not basing its positions on strict science but, in fact, has been massaging the facts to try to entice politicians into adopting a zero Covid strategy.  Four weeks ago, the head of the group wrote to its members asking them to &quot;look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty&quot; and to &quot;go after people and not institutions&quot; because &quot;people hurt faster than institutions&quot;.  He stated that ridicule &quot;is man's most powerful weapon&quot; and that &quot;the threat of a thing is usually more terrifying than the thing itself&quot;.  In other words, people should be scared into accepting zero Covid.<\/p><p>That correspondence reads like something out of Saul Alinsky's <i>Rules for Radicals<\/i>.  Perhaps it is something from that book.  The Social Democrats appear to have bought into the proposals.  The correspondence suggests that the group has been deliberately adjusting its targets for zero Covid in order to convince that party's leadership to subscribe to the strategy.  All of this information is in the public domain and yet, incredibly, it has not been reported by RT&Eacute; or in the print media.  Why is such a group allowed to scaremonger without at least being challenged by politicians or the media on its internal conversations about which we now know?  When a medical doctor advocates hurting people because &quot;people hurt faster than institutions&quot;, should that person's views be supported by Oireachtas Members and reported uncritically in the media?<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that University College Cork, UCC, has decided not to pursue the joint college arrangement with Minzu University in China.  The arrangement would have seen courses across a number of disciplines being delivered jointly.  Minzu University has been the focus of concern since one of its teaching staff and a member of the Uyghur community, Mr. Ilham Tohti, and several of his students were arrested and jailed on the basis of alleged separatist activity on its campus.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It concerns me that UCC seems to be unafraid to say that it has taken this latest decision on ethical grounds.  The fear seems to be, according to one internal consultant's report, that it had about the need for tact and the danger of leading the Chinese authorities to consider that they had lost face.  Does this not show what a dangerous player we are dealing with in China when it comes to transparency and respect for human dignity?  That is why I have been calling on the Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to examine existing and planned relationships between Irish colleges and universities and Chinese counterparts.  There is much more that needs to be examined and said but UCC's decision to freeze the joint college arrangement is at least a welcome first development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#T00200","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I join with the Leader and previous speakers in thanking Sinead, the artist, for the magnificent portrait in front of us.  Let the message be that we will no longer stand for the airbrushing of women out of history.  This is a message that needs to go out loud and clear.  I wish the Leader and all my female colleagues in the Oireachtas, and all the female officials and staff who assist us so professionally every day, mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann indeed, a happy International Women's Day.<\/p> <p>I raise a number of ongoing matters with the Leader.  The first relates to childcare.  I continue to receive representations from families who continue to struggle with the cost of childcare.  As I have said before in this House, too many families rise early each morning to ferry their children to childcare facilities, which most of the time is part of a commute for the parents to attend work.  This childcare costs families the equivalent of a second mortgage but they are left with no option but to pay it in the absence of a national childcare scheme.  As a result, family life and community life in the so-called commuter counties around the capital are affected daily.  We must take a more holistic approach to community life.  We must address the cost of childcare and, most importantly, we must address the obstacles that such costs put in front of young families.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House so that we can debate the childcare issue again.<\/p> <p>I raise again the urgent need to review the means test for carer's allowance.  I am currently dealing with two cases out of a number I have been presented with where both applicants are above the current limits.  These limits have not changed since 2008.  I think we can all agree that Ireland has changed much in those 13 years.  In both those cases, women have given up their careers to look after loved ones.  I have no doubt, and in both cases medical professionals have said, that those they are caring for would be in State care were it not for the 24-7 care provided by those involved.  In replies to parliamentary questions by Labour Party colleagues, we were informed that almost 50% of carer's allowance applications have been refused.  There is no question that both these young women never gave a second thought to putting their careers on hold to provide 24-7 care for their loved ones.  I ask the Leader to bring my concerns to the attention of the Minister.  I am sure that there are many more in this House with similar stories of the sacrifice that many are making, which effectively saves the State billions of euro.<\/p> <p>In the time that I have left, I want to reflect on International Women's Day again.  It is important that we all acknowledge how all our lives are influenced and shaped by the women who are most important to us.  I wish to acknowledge that here today.  I thank them all.  I also want to remember those special women who shaped my life and gave me a love of community and place who are unfortunately no longer with us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#U00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their contributions.

The Cathaoirleach is involved in that and I thank him for that.<\/p> <p>We had a number of wonderful Commencement matters this morning.  This over-dependence on women when it comes to the climate crisis has to be recognised.  It is called the eco-gender divide.  It is well recognised.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Oxfam have stated that women are bearing the brunt of climate collapse all around the world.  In times of drought, they walk farther and farther for water.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have the domestic chores laid at their feet and they do not have economic independence, including in Ireland, so when it comes to making decisions on sustainability in consumer affairs and domestic chores, it usually does fall to women as well to make them.  Advertisers have often taken advantage of that and they have advertised so-called eco or green products directly to women.  That is alienating men more and more from the sustainability and greening that we need to see as we move forward.  It is the job of all of us to do this now.<\/p><p>I welcome the consultation on EirGrid.  When we look at all of the commitments in the programme for Government, they are very much dependent on a secure and stable electricity grid in order to make that happen.

I urge the Leader to continue to apply pressure to make sure that we get results on that, especially on maternity leave.  A Green Party councillor, Clare O'Byrne, having had a baby in December, announced today that she can no longer continue with public representation.  That is the only reason she is giving up her seat.  The fact that one cannot take a break and there is no proxy voting or administrative help adds to the lack of maternity leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#U00300","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I apologise for arriving late and for trying to do two jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#V00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>The Senator arrived just on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#V00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Women are familiar with that situation.  I am on a committee as well as in the Seanad Chamber.<\/p><p>Today, I wish to raise access to justice, in particular for women.  We have good laws, but they are not enforced or people do not have the resources to access justice to see them enforced.  I wish to raise two barriers that prevent women accessing justice.  The first relates to the housing assistance payment, HAP, and accessing free legal aid.  The problem is that HAP counts towards income when calculating eligibility for civil legal aid.  That does not make sense because HAP and homeless HAP are never paid to the tenant, they are paid directly to the landlord.  This is especially an issue for women accessing justice since the majority of people in receipt of HAP are women, as are the majority of single-parent households.  It is especially relevant for those who have fled from domestic violence situations who are unable to take proceedings for maintenance or to defend applications for access to children.  People, mostly women, are being denied access to the courts every day as a result of this discriminatory interpretation of the law.  At present, two individuals with the same income are treated differently when it comes to applying for civil legal aid.<\/p><p>Another issue is that women are not able to access free legal aid when they take equality cases to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Speaking in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Eilis Barry, chief executive of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, said that fact almost certainly meant many employment discrimination or sexual harassment cases were simply not being taken, although there could be a raft of cases out there.  It is not because there has not been a breach of law or because the case is not strong enough, rather, it is because the victims do not have the resources to get representation.  Technically, victims have the opportunity to represent themselves but here too there is more systemic injustice because in addition to being less well-off in monetary terms, people on lower incomes face greater levels of time poverty.  This is especially true for women who take on more care work, so even if they wanted to represent themselves, women are at a disadvantage.  This puts workers in the lowest-paid jobs in a vulnerable position.  During the pandemic we saw displays of solidarity with front-line workers such as retail staff and delivery drivers, but it is time we back up the clap with tangible action that will make a difference.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is time for tangible change.  While I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to examine this issue, it would be good to get clarity from the Minister for Justice on whether that will be an independent investigation or one that will be carried out by the Department.

It is very important to note not just the contribution she made in the shaping of Ireland but also that she continued to serve for the rest of her life in the National Maternity Hospital.  An issue I highlighted in the Commencement debate this morning, one which I hope the House will debate, is the importance of ensuring the National Maternity Hospital is in public ownership, under public control and subject to public accountability.<\/p> <p>We talk about how far we have to go but one of the things about going further is that we also need to change course.  For too long, Ireland has not lived up to its responsibilities to women and has found ways to outsource those responsibilities, such as the delivery of essential services, especially to pregnant women.  It is important that we now have the kind of State that Elizabeth O'Farrell fought for, one that takes responsibility for women and has real equality for women and men.<\/p> <p>To move from the national to the international, given that it is International Women's Day, I will highlight two issues that I hope we will have a chance to discuss further over the coming weeks.  One is the very worrying rollback on reproductive rights for women in Poland.  Today, parliamentarians across Europe are taking a stand in support of women because we know the impact those cruel laws can have in terms of issues like fatal foetal anomaly and we know the very real experiences.  Ireland is one of the few countries that knows what that can mean.  I send solidarity on that today.<\/p> <p>I also send solidarity to front-line health workers across the world - nurses like Elizabeth O'Farrell - so many of whom are women and so many of whom are balancing work for society with the work of care.  I am concerned that we are still not facing up to our responsibilities to show solidarity in providing access to vaccination for front-line health workers who are women.  Nurses all over the world are still awaiting vaccination.  I hope we will have a specific debate on COVAX and the coronavirus treatment acceleration program, CTAP, and how Ireland can step up its support, including by applying pressure on intellectual property sharing, if necessary through the World Health Organization, to ensure that front-line workers, the new generation of Elizabeth O'Farrells, are given support and care, as they have given care to their societies.  <\/p> <p>I wish a happy International Women's Day to all of my wonderful colleagues across the House and to the women of Ireland more widely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#W00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Ireland, like many other countries in the European Union, has been let down by the vaccination roll-out.

In recent conversations we have had with Family Carers Ireland, we have been told that no one ever asks carers how they are.  People ask how whomever they care for is but no one ever asks how they are doing.  Today, I want us to remember that more than 60% of the carers in Ireland are women.  I want to reach out and ask how they are today and to encourage them to take five minutes, to have a cup of coffee and to think of themselves.<\/p> <p>I am very grateful that the programme for Government builds on the national carers strategy, launched by a Government of which my party was part, and that we have a refreshed impetus to provide supports for family carers.

If a carer has to go to hospital for an emergency appointment or if an appointment is cancelled and he or she has an opportunity to be seen early, he or she does not have access to immediate respite care.  Care for carers themselves is left at the bottom of the list because there is no emergency respite care.  I would like the House to have an opportunity to present those views or to have them communicated to the Minister.  I have done so myself, as have others.

The most senior military officer in the country made a recommendation only for it to be whipped away by some civilian.  The Defence Forces are falling apart.  Some 800 people sought to rejoin but only 62 were accepted.  These 800 veterans came forward to stand up for the cause.

Over the last number of years, we have watched the destruction of the Defence Forces.  There have been issues with the medical corps, the absence of technical pay and the closing of the Army apprenticeship school.  This school was closed with six weeks' notice while the teachers were paid for the rest of the year.  Civil instructors, when they were there, were paid.  The Army Ranger Wing is falling apart.

It is a mixed view but I think neither, to be honest.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to provide a debate on the future of rural Ireland.  This stems from the closure of post offices and the recent announcement by Bank of Ireland to close many of its branches, which are spread primarily around rural Ireland such as west Cork, west Kerry, Connemara, Clare, and Donegal.  I live in a beautiful village called Schull.  It is likely that in the next three to four years the three post offices in the peninsula, Goleen, Schull and Ballydehob, will close.  For a person living in the village of Goleen, the former home of the great P.J. Sheehan, the nearest Bank of Ireland is 28 miles away.  I had to laugh about a report I read the other day - I sent an email to the bank and it came back to me stating the same - that in most instances there will be a post office within 500 meters of a Bank of Ireland or an AIB bank.  What a joke.  I am sure the same would apply to the Beara Peninsula, Dingle, Connemara, Clare and such places.<\/p> <p>I would like to see a debate on the future of rural Ireland.

The threat posed to democracy as a form of government comes in many guises and from many sources.  It is both external, as is happening in Hong Kong, and internal, as we see in Myanmar.  However, it also comes from complacency and the idea that democracy is so perfect and so fair a system it does not require constant work and attention to ensure its continuance.  It requires constant and active attention.  As one of the oldest continuous democracies, we have a duty to advocate for democracy by standing unashamedly with other democracies.<\/p> <p>Our deep respect and affection for the Chinese people and their great culture should not prevent us from speaking out loudly and clearly against China's cruel and totalitarian regime.  It is not in our ethical or commercial interest to continue to speak softly about the atrocities committed for, and by, the Chinese Communist Party.  We must stand firmly with those in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan who stand up for democracy.  Our Government must recognise there are other emerging markets in the region, that value and defend democracy, with which we can stand and should do business. Colleagues have raised the issue of China in this House, as I have, on many occasions.  However, we need to extend that debate to address democracy across the entire world.  Democratic states should stand up for other democratic states.  I look forward to that debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#DD00100","speaker":"1687"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Happy International Women's Day 2021, or is it 2017?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers women in work index, progress for women in work could be back to 2017 levels by the end of this year.  Some are rightly calling the effect of Covid-19 a global \"shecession\".  The index measures 33 OECD countries across the gender pay gap, labour force participation, women's unemployment and full-time employment.  Ireland has mixed results.  The gender pay gap has lessened, but the female unemployment rate in 2020 increased at double the rate of men's.  For example, that women hold 76% of the jobs in healthcare means they are not only more vulnerable to contracting Covid-19, but also to becoming unemployed because of it.  Traditionally, women are more likely to be in temporary, part-time and precarious employment at 26.5% versus 15.1% of males across the EU.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures tell us that just over 9% of women compared with 0.4% of men took unpaid leave during the pandemic.  Women are more vulnerable to redundancies right now and to the long-term economic effect of Covid-19 because of pressures on their time and their Internet bandwidths as well as structural inequalities.<\/p><p>I hope that today is not an exercise in women talking to themselves.  We have glaring problems with the gender pay gap, the gender care gap and the lack of investment in public services in care.  There are plenty of men and women in the House to have a genuine discussion on the barriers to sharing care work in houses across the country.  We need a review of care at every stage of life and investment in our care economy as part of a gender-sensitive recovery.  We cannot afford not to.  If the statistics around employment do not convince Members, then what about this?  Persistent disparities in employment participation cost Europe more than &euro;335 billion per year, or 2.41% of EU GDP in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#DD00200","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Leader and the Cathaoirleach on the unveiling this afternoon.

She is a tremendous peace campaigner, activist, socialist, actor and writer whom I have regularly met for many years on the peace trail at Shannon Airport.  I salute her among all other colleagues on this important day.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight a fantastic report on inequality by Unite the Union, entitled \"Hungry Bellies are not Equal to Full Bellies: Exploring inequality and deprivation in Ireland\".  It is a devastating analysis of inequality and puts to bed some nonsensical statements that were made a few months ago in this Chamber about inequality decreasing.  The statistics and analysis are all there, but I was struck by the personal testimonies of front-line workers like those in Cork Penny Dinners who told us that poverty was growing constantly and there was no equality where poverty was concerned.  Inner City Helping Homeless cites an increase of more than 400% in the number of homeless children between 2015 and 2019.  As such, it is timely for us to debate inequality.  We could flesh out all of these details.<\/p> <p>This weekend marked the anniversary of a dark day in the history of Limerick.  One hundred years ago, a mayor and former mayor - Seoirse Clancy and Michael O'Callaghan - were murdered.  In the early hours of 7 March, crown forces, including the RIC and the Black and Tans, burst into their homes and shot them dead in front of their families.  At the same time on the south side of the city, Joseph O'Donoghue from County Westmeath, which is my home county, was removed from his house.  His body was found the next morning with 18 bullet holes in it.  This was a significant weekend for Limerick and one that we wanted to mark in many ways.  Unfortunately, Covid has prevented us from doing so thus far.  I hope that we will get the chance to do so later in the year, but the House should be sure of this - Limerick remembers its murdered martyrs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#EE00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#EE00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Broad-ranging issues have been discussed in the Chamber to mark International Women's Day, but one matter that is of particular importance to me from my previous job as a sports journalist is that of inequality in funding for women's sport.  The disparity between women's and men's sport remains as large as ever and the efforts to address it are painfully slow.  I pay tribute to Mary O'Connor, CEO of the Federation of Irish Sport, for her work in this regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I pay tribute also to the various sporting organisations that are responsible for the various codes in soccer, GAA, rugby and track and field.  They have not just sat around waiting for something to happen; they are making change happen for themselves.  This is best epitomised by the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, LGFA, which, through a great commercial partnership with TG4 and Lidl as its main sponsors, has upped the ante on this issue.  Both businesses are to be commended on their advertising campaigns, namely, Real Fans and Levelling the Playing Field.  <br\/><br\/>Are we anywhere near levelling the playing field?  Last week, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture Sport and the Gaeltacht, we discussed a letter we had received from Maria Kinsella, the chairperson of the Women's Gaelic Players Association.  She sent extensive documentation to us on the funding allocation for women's sport and on the progress made in increasing sport participation.  It made for stark reading.  She stated that Government grants for a male player stand at &euro;1,363, while for female players, the sum is &euro;424.  On gym access, there is no cost for male players whereas 70% of female players pay their own costs, and injury expenses are not much better.  My 11-year-old girl, CJ, is passionate about athletics and her favourite book is <i>Girls Play Too<\/i>by Jacqui Hurley from RT&Eacute;, a book of inspiring stories of Irish sportswomen.  It is a fantastic book.  Jackie designed it to show girls like CJ that Irish girls and women can achieve the highest accolades in sport and, by writing and illustrating the book, to show them the role models who exist in various codes and disciplines.  If that book is to mean anything, we Senators, Deputies and the Cabinet need to ensure that funding towards women's sport is equalised and that the Levelling the Playing Field advertisement becomes a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#EE00400","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I congratulate all concerned on the unveiling of that stunningly beautiful piece of art this morning, which is so appropriate on International Women's Day.

The good news reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \t[T]his week will see the first Covid-19 vaccinations among medically vulnerable people aged between 16 and 69 who are at a very high risk of severe disease and death. ... It is estimated there could be up to 160,000 people aged between 16 and 69 who are deemed to be at a high risk from Covid-19 because of serious illness. <\/blockquote> <p>That is all very good.  My question is how.  These headlines put GPs into a tailspin, and there is great expectation, but there is no commensurate communication and consultation.  The respected medical commentator and GP, Dr. Ilona Duffy, stated yesterday that GPs bear the brunt of these big-time announcements.  Two practices in her home town were left behind, with no vaccinations.  This causes tension because there is such a strong expectation and then people are let down, which heightens and intensifies anxiety.  Of that wonderful announcement from earlier, which I warmly welcome, I ask how.  Can we please communicate and bring people with us, rather than running to the airwaves with a big-time announcement unless the pieces of the complicated jigsaw are in order?<\/p><p>I welcome the offer of Ulster unionism's leader at the weekend to give us some vaccines.  I was proud that she would care about the entire island of Ireland but embarrassed that this had not been done already.

Her remarks still ring true today.<\/p><blockquote>\tFor far too long women have laboured, and sadly continue to labour, under an abundance of discriminatory attitudes, practices and even laws.  It has taken the tenacity, valour and obstinate determination of many women over the years to reverse the blatant discrimination against them in the laws. ...  <br \/><br \/>The Constitution is the guiding light for all our laws.  It is the soil in which the plant of our law is rooted.  Yet, viewed from a woman's point of view, it is an unbalanced document.  Women, wherever they get a mention, are by and large relegated exclusively to domestic spheres.  No other role is readily seen for women.  The language and thinking of the Constitution are male dominated.  Yet is it not an ironic twist that remedies for some of the injustices against women have been arrived at by recourse to the Constitution? ... As matters stand, the recognition of equality of women can be won or lost by the attitude to the Constitution by the courts.<br \/><br \/>I am not at all impressed by the Government's recital of all they are supposed to have done to improve the lot of women.  Is it not scarcely a matter for self-congratulation that they have set about righting injustices against half the population?  The fact that we still need an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights serves to show that women do not yet enjoy full equality in all spheres.  The very existence of this committee, and indeed the lack of a men's rights committee, speaks volumes of the position of women in Irish society in 1991.  <\/blockquote><p>I think much of what she stated back then still rings true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#FF00300","speaker":"1629","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I commend all my colleagues who have spoken on International Women's Day today.

The deadline is this coming Friday.  The Phoenix Park is almost 360 years old.  I was lucky enough to grow up beside it.  It is an amazing public resource in the heart of our city, comprising more than 1,700 acres.  One can walk, cycle, skate, picnic or play Gaelic games, polo or cricket or do whatever one wishes to do there.  One can enjoy the biodiversity, including the wild fallow deer.

I was really disappointed by, and quite critical of, the fact that it did not include local residents.  There has now been almost six weeks of public consultation.  It has been particularly difficult for residents to engage in that process as a result of Covid which, to be fair to the OPW, has also prevented it from holding public meetings.  The deadline is this coming Friday and there are important proposals and suggestions being made, including prioritising pedestrians, prioritising space for cyclists, reducing commuter traffic, restricting access through the Cabra, Ashtown and Knockmaroon gates and introducing a public bus service for the first time to connect Heuston Station with Dublin Zoo, the Ashtown visitor centre and all the way to Broombridge Station in Cabra.  There is a lot in the proposals.  The deadline is this Friday.

There is a fear in Cork that the island of the city, including St. Patrick's Street, is dying a death.  We must breathe new life into it.  We must regenerate, reimagine and reconfigure the island of Cork city.  I understand that Bishop Lucey Park is part of a new urban regeneration fund and we are seeing movement in Grand Parade and the docklands.  My concern is that we will not see the island of Cork city being developed and I am asking the Minister to come to the House because I have a fear that Cork city is being left behind.

It was really lovely and I congratulate the Ahearn family.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin spoke about some of the discomfort that is being shared on our airwaves about the vaccination roll-out.  I shared his concerns last week and I welcome that my Daddy, who is one of the over 85-year olds, is finally getting his vaccination today.  That is a huge weight off all of our minds.  We all received a copy of a communication this morning that was sent to all of our GPs yesterday on the proposed roll-out to the next 160,000 critical people to receive their vaccinations.  I take on board the Senator's comments.  Communication is key and it needs to be clear, consistent and constant.  I will pass that message back on.<\/p> <p>Senator Cassells talked about equality of opportunity for women in sport.  What he said this morning about equality of opportunity in every aspect of life is true.  We must positively discriminate.  I know that sometimes we talk about positively discriminating on behalf of women in politics or education and the usual cohorts come out and mention tokenism.  We have positively discriminated for men from time immemorial and from the foundation of the State and nobody ever batted an eyelid.  The only way we will ever equal the stages of every platform that women and men should have equal access to is if men help us.  I do not say that flippantly because one cannot be what one cannot see.  Our young women must be able to see leadership in sport, education, politics and every walk of life.  It is equally true that men must be able to see men leading in caring professions.  Otherwise, they will not want to be what they cannot see.  The only way we will change that is in a collective manner.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The disparity of the funding between men and women in sport is an absolute crime.

I thank the Senator for bringing that to the attention of the House. <br\/><br\/>Senator Gavan spoke about the Unite report.  It would be timely to have a debate on the inequality that exists for so many in Ireland and I will make that representation today.<br\/><br\/>Senator Currie talked about the global &quot;shecession&quot;.  It is an absolute crime how much Covid has had an impact not just on Irish society but on every society.  It has put women back 20 or 30 years.  We were so close to having full employment.  Senator Currie and I were working last year or the year before on returnships for women to try to get the massive resource of women who are not working back into Irish society.  Women have been disproportionately affected in unemployment figures over the past 12 months, which means we will have to redouble our efforts.  When the vaccination programme takes hold and allows us to reopen our society, our communities and our economy, we must make sure those women who have been disproportionately affected through their care duties over the past 12 months are encouraged back into the workforce. <br\/><br\/>Senator Wilson asked for a debate on democracy.  I will certainly arrange that in the next few days and the request will go to the Minister. <br\/><br\/>Senator Sherlock spoke about something that would be a tremendous pity if it were to go ahead.

I will write a letter today on the Senator's behalf to the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and the Minister of State responsible for disability to seek a resolution to that issue. <br\/><br\/>Senator Dolan spoke about the need to support women and spoke so eloquently about the ladies in her life, that is, her two nannies and her mammy, and how they have propelled her into Irish life. <br\/><br\/>Senator O'Donovan spoke about the future of rural Ireland and requested a debate on it.  I will send that request to the Ministers today.<br\/><br\/>Senator Craughwell brought up his much loved Defence Forces, as he does nearly every week, and how some of the actions he sees at the moment pain him.  That request for a debate has gone to the Minister for Defence and I will give a date for it as soon as one is agreed. <br\/><br\/>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the need for supports for family carers.  That has been more evident than ever during the last 12 months, if it needed to be more evident, and I will request a debate on that too.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gallagher talked about the delays in the vaccination roll-out, the need for a plan B as well as a plan C and for co-operation North and South.  It is nearly 12 months nearly to the day since I sat at the first Cabinet Covid special committee.  Its anniversary is tomorrow and it is a tremendous pity that we are still talking about co-operation between the North and the South.  At this stage, talk is cheap.  We should be doing things.  That responsibility lies on everybody North and South, not just the people who are speaking the loudest. <br\/><br\/>Senator Higgins talked about the need for the National Maternity Hospital to be maintained.  I do not think she is alone in her views.  We have a long way to go but we have come so far that it would be retrograde for us to be stepping backwards.  I note the letter from our eminent obstetrician in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>last week and agree wholeheartedly with him.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Boylan talked about inequality in accessing justice and free legal aid because of HAP, which she has mentioned before.  I have written to the Minister but I will follow up again today.<br\/><br\/>Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about the eco gender divide, how, like most issues it falls disproportionately on women and the need for a debate on it.<br\/><br\/>Senator Wall spoke about childcare costs and the need for a debate on that issue.  I will make that request today.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mullen spoke about the disinformation and dishonesty that has become evident with regard to the zero Covid campaigners.  He reflected on certain politicians believing this information, which is a pity.  The old saying that goes with us is that when the information changes, our opinions should too.  I welcome the fact that people now realise that what we have been doing is in the public's best interests.<br\/><br\/>Senator Chambers started off the day by welcoming the beautiful piece of art from Sinead Guckian, as did I.

I also thank the Cathaoirleach for inviting me, as chair of the Oireachtas Women's Caucus, to chair this session.<\/p> <p>As we gather in this Chamber to mark International Women's Day, we must thank all those who have gone before us and upon whose shoulders we stand.  We remember Countess Constance Markievicz, the first woman ever elected and of course the very first female Minister.  To think that over 100 years later we have had just over 100 women elected is quite simply incredible.  I am sure it is not what she anticipated at that time.  We must think also of the number of firsts we have had with women in Leinster House and outside it, including: the first woman Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who went on to become the first female European Commissioner; Mary Harney, who was the first female T&aacute;naiste; and Mary Robinson, formerly a Member of this House and the first female President.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Acting Chairperson (Senator Fiona O'Loughlin):<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I had a very engaging session earlier with the Association of Irish Local Government.  Councillor Mary Hoade is the first female president of the association.  <\/p><p>When we look back to the start of International Women's Day, we see that 15,000 women marched through New York city in 1908 demanding voting rights, better pay and shorter working hours.  One year later, on 28 February 1909, the first national women's day was observed in the US.  In 1910, a German woman, Clara Zetkin, called for an international women's day to be observed.  A conference of over 100 women from 17 countries agreed and International Women's Day was created.  In 1913, it was decided to transfer International Women's Day to 8 March and it has been celebrated on that day ever since.  <\/p><p>The original aim of that day was to achieve full gender equality.  More than 100 years later, this has not been realised in any field.  This year's theme, therefore, of choose to challenge is very appropriate and more important than ever.  In 2019, women essentially worked for free for 51 days of the year because of the gender pay gap.  The World Economic Forum has stated that this pay gap would not be closed until 2186, a truly frightening prospect.  I suspect that this is far worse because of the year we have just endured.  According to research published two years ago, over one-third of women in the Irish workforce considered leaving or have left professional positions due to opportunity inequalities in their own company.  The Duff and Phelps study revealed that 39% of female employees felt that there was a lack of equal opportunities in comparison with their male colleagues.  Almost half of those who took part in the study thought the Government should improve shared parental leave options, 77% believed we should work on incentivising flexitime and remote working and 54% said we should force organisations to disclose their gender pay gaps.  Two years later, we have learned so much more about remote working and how we can support that.  I know the Minister will provide some information about legislation concerning the disclosure of gender pay gaps later.  <\/p><p>It is very clear that Ireland needs equal opportunities for both genders to ensure we have a diverse and effective workforce.  Today is also a day to reflect on progress we have made, celebrate and encourage the determination of ordinary women doing extraordinary things in our communities and press for change.  It is also a time to think of our sisters in other countries with fewer rights than those enjoyed by us and to stand in solidarity with their struggle for equality.  <\/p><p>I often think there is a huge responsibility on us as elected females to improve female participation in politics and improve the lives of women in this country.  We need women at all levels to change the dynamic, reshape the conversation and make sure women's voices are heard and heeded, not overlooked and ignored.  We know that women's voices make a difference.  We know that 62% of local councils in India that were female-led had more water than those in male-led councils, while in Norway, there was a direct relationship between women on municipal councils and childcare provisions.  Following the motion on period poverty from the women's caucus during the previous mandate, the programme for Government ensured that this was included.  <\/p><p>As to the business of the day, there is no doubt that Covid has severely impacted women in many different ways, from the 78% of our front-line healthcare workers who are female to the women working in essential retail.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Acting Chairman (Senator Fiona O'Loughlin):<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All the time these women are trying to balance childcare and home schooling.  Of course, it has equally impacted on women who do not have employment opportunities because other retail and hospitality have been closed as well.  That further widens the gender pay gap and one can see that at present, 4% more women than men are unemployed.<\/p><p>At this stage I will ask the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, to make a contribution of ten minutes.  He is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#WW00200","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank Members for the opportunity to speak today about equal opportunities and access for women in all spheres of life, whether it be economic, social, cultural or political.  It is important that we have these debates to keep the issue of gender equality live in mainstream politics.  I welcome the initiative of the Irish Women's Parliamentary Caucus  to raise the matter.  I note the appropriateness of Senator O'Loughlin chairing this session given her role as chairperson of the women&rsquo;s caucus.  I believe the caucus has been an important and significant development in how, as an Oireachtas, we come together to tackle the issues and barriers towards women's participation in politics and all spheres of life in a co-operative and cross-party manner.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the theme chosen this year for International Women's Day by UN Women is \"Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.\"  This theme encourages us to celebrate the tremendous efforts made by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the pandemic.<\/p> <p>I will speak about the work that is under way across Government to support these principles.  Before I do that I would like to reflect for a few moments on the impact the Covid-19 pandemic and all events that surround it have had on women and girls in Ireland and worldwide.<\/p> <p>Since February last year, almost 215,000 people in Ireland are confirmed as having contracted Covid-19.  We have lost over 4,000 family members, neighbours and friends to this disease.  Women are a majority, 52.5%, of confirmed cases and a little under half, 49.8%, of those who have lost their lives.  The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated many existing inequalities in society, including inequality that disadvantages women.  Healthcare workers are among the occupations most at risk of contracting Covid-19 and make up approximately 26,500, or 12% of the cases.  Women are over-represented in the sectors with greater exposure to infection and the sectors with greatest exposure to job losses.  Women have carried an unequal share of the unpaid work of keeping families going.  Across the population, women's days involve longer hours and increased stress with implications for their physical and mental health and well-being.  The Central Statistics Office surveys have highlighted that women's well-being is being more adversely affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  Women are disproportionately victims of domestic and gender-based violence and at greater risk.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reported a 17% rise in calls relating to domestic abuse in 2020, and the response of the Garda through Operation Faoiseamh has been crucial in ensuring that victims can access the supports they need throughout the pandemic.<\/p> <p>In addition, my Department has increased funding for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services through Tusla by &euro;4.7 million to a total of &euro;30 million in 2021.  Domestic violence is not a product of the crisis, however.  Sadly, it will remain with us into the future.  In keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government, my Department is examining the introduction of paid leave for victims of domestic and intimate partner violence.  I note that Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward legislation dealing with this issue last year.<\/p> <p>As part of the process of addressing the issue of paid domestic violence leave, I have already begun engaging in consultations with service providers, victims' groups, trade unions and employer representative groups.  Following these consultations I will be bringing forward legislative proposals.<\/p> <p>As I said earlier in the Seanad today, the Government is also advancing an audit of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services and responsibility across Departments and State agencies.  Tusla is undertaking an accommodation review to ascertain the degree of accommodation present for victims.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These actions together represent the action the Government is taking against the epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in our society.  <\/p><p>Covid-19 presented to us as a health crisis, but also as an economic crisis and a social crisis.  In our response to the Covid-19 crisis we are afforded an opportunity to re-examine old certainties, to call out and challenge gender stereotypes and attitudes that have restricted opportunities for women and men for so long and to reshape society for the better.  A patriarchal society still exists, sexism still exists and women must still face misogyny in everyday life.  The world we live in has been transformed entirely by the pandemic.  We need to make sure that as we emerge from these difficult times, equality and gender equality are at the forefront of our minds.  We have the opportunity to change the world for the better and we must seize that opportunity.<\/p><p>One of my early decisions on taking on this ministerial portfolio has been to chair the strategy committee overseeing the implementation of the national strategy for women and girls and to extend the strategy to the end of 2021.  As we look forward to renewed effort to draw the current strategy to a close, it is important that we acknowledge the achievements realised in advancing women&rsquo;s leadership since the strategy was launch in 2017.  I have set an ambitious work programme to be achieved by my Department under the strategy this year that will involve expanding the family leave available, including the Government&rsquo;s commitment for a Bill to extend parental leave, which we will address in the Seanad on Friday.  If we are to better support women in employment, we need to improve how women are treated throughout the whole pregnancy and improve the supports provided to women after the birth of a child.<\/p><p>The First 5 strategy includes a commitment to undertake a review of the relevant provisions of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 on the issue of extending the current entitlement to paid breastfeeding breaks or paid reduction in working hours for breastfeeding mothers in the workforce from 26 to 104 weeks after the baby's birth.  It is proposed to take forward legislative proposals in this regard late in 2021.  We also intend to take forward the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019 in the coming weeks.  I will be seeking Cabinet approval for an amended Bill in the next fortnight and I hope to see this legislation resumed in the D&aacute;il after Easter and subsequently rapidly passed and enacted.<\/p><p>Childcare, one of the \"5-C\" barriers named in Senator Bacik's report for this House as potential barriers to women's engagement in political leadership, is an issue we are determined to tackle.  In particular, my Department continues to invest in the national childcare scheme and has begun to look at the potential for family leave for Members of the Oireachtas and its legal and practical implications.<\/p><p>Reflecting on this year's theme of equal access and opportunities for women, it is important that we commend those sectors where progress has been made in increasing women's representation.  Sectors in which the greatest gains are being made include those where we have begun to measure and track systematically the representation of women in leadership.  In business leadership, the balance for better business initiative has shone a spotlight on gender balance in the governance of our largest companies and the benefits to be accrued by greater diversity.  Following a proactive focus, the representation of women among directors of the largest publicly listed companies in Ireland has increased by over nine percentage points, from 18.1% in 2018 to 27.4% in September 2020.<\/p><p>In higher education and research, the measures set out in a national review in 2016 and a task force in 2017 are accelerating progress towards gender equality.  To support and ensure sustainable change, a centre for excellence in gender equality is established in the Higher Education Authority and institutions have adopted the Athena SWAN charter.  The Government is also investing in the senior academic leadership Initiative, creating additional posts to accelerate gender balance.  In 2015, 81% of professorial positions were held by men; by 2019 this was 74%.  Leadership and governance is one of the four key strategic areas on which the Sport Ireland policy on women in sport is based.  In line with this policy, Sport Ireland now publishes biannual updates of female representation on the boards of sports national governing bodies funded by the State.  Female representation, at 24% in 2019, increased to 29% in the first update.  This monitoring has grounded Sport Ireland's investment in female leadership capacity and guides governance best practice that supports gender equity.<\/p><p>These are just some examples of the achievements of recent years under the existing strategy.  As we move to looking at what will follow the strategy, I want to identify the key areas in which we can make a difference in the coming years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Acting Chairperson for facilitating the debate and look forward to the contributions from Senators across the House.

I wish all of my colleagues a happy International Women's Day.  The women leaders in my life are my mum, Mary, my grannies, Phyllis and Bridie, and my three sisters, Ciara, Michelle and Karen.  They are my inspiration for the work that I do, the people who surround me every day and drive me to do the work that I do to make this a better country for the women and girls coming up behind us.  We all know the statistics and are very much familiar with the gaps and imbalance that still persists for women in Irish life.  While we have come a long way, the biggest impediment now to achieving true equality is the notion that we have already got there, that equality is done and dusted and already achieved.  We have not achieved equality and there is a long way to go.<\/p> <p>Some of the pushback that I often get is that others ask why I am still discussing the matter because I am in politics, got elected and can do whatever I want.  It is not as simple and obvious as that but those barriers are real, ever present and there to be taken down.  It is incumbent on us, as public representatives, to lead and be role models for young girls coming behind us, and to young boys who are coming along the way.  Those boys should see that this is a country that values equality and wants to reach a point where we can truly say that men and women are equal in all aspects of Irish life. <\/p> <p>When we look at our Parliament, less than 23% of Deputies are female and 40% of Senators are female.  The percentage of Senators is an example of what can be achieved with determination to achieve balance.  Only 25% of councillors are female and there is a considerable imbalance across the regions.  Mayo County Council has 30 councillors, only two of whom are female.  There is a huge imbalance between rural and urban Ireland at local government level and that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>We know that Equal Pay Day falls on 9 November.  That is the day on which women in this country stop getting paid, effectively, because of the 14.4% gap in gender pay.  We think that happens in other countries but not here.  It does happen here.  Women get paid less and that has a knock-on effect on pensions in later life.  Women are at greater risk of being in poverty in later years.  <\/p> <p>We also know that female representation on boards is not where it needs to be.  Only 10% of women comprise corporate boards in this country.  The figure is slightly better for State boards where women represent 36% of the total but there is still a bit to go before equality is achieved.  Only 7% of women lead those boards.  We have a long way to go yet.<\/p> <p>It is important that we ask why there is such low representation of women in, for example, political life.  Why are women not attracted to entering politics, running for election and staying in politics?  What are the challenges that persist?  There are times when I get quite frustrated that the debate always seems to centre around caregiving and childcare, as if those things are only the responsibility of women.  We know that those issues are significant barriers for women because, time and time again, they are identified as the key reasons women feel they cannot enter public life.  They also leave public life for those reasons because they find the balance hard to strike.  That is because women are still the primary caregivers in many families and that pressure still falls to them.  That is why we, as legislators, need to do an awful lot more to address parental leave to give fathers that opportunity to take time off to be at home so that the women who want and choose to go back to work earlier, or whenever they choose to go back, have the option to do so.  As it stands, the high cost of childcare is a financial barrier to some women getting back to work and some families would be worse off if the women went back to work.<\/p> <p>We need to challenge some of the stereotypes that persist about women in leadership positions, not only in political life, but in business and every aspect of Irish life.  We often hear a man described as ambitious, a great negotiator or a strong advocate for X, Y or Z.  A woman who adopts a similar stance is often seen as aggressive, not very nice or a little bit cold.  That is the terminology, the language we use to describe women who are just doing their jobs well, want to be ambitious and to succeed in their careers.  The words we use to describe women who follow those pathways are always negative while positive wording is used to describe men in similar positions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Sometimes women can be as difficult when criticising each other.  It is as important that we do not pull the ladder up after ourselves and that we encourage women to enter politics, public life and business.  We should be there to facilitate others coming through and make that as easy as we can.  That is why the work of organisations such as Women For Election is fantastic.  I have been involved with that organisation since its inception.  I have been through all of its training programmes.  The training was top class and I learned so much in those programmes, and the collegiality was also fantastic.  I met women from all different parties and none.  Some of us entered the Oireachtas together, at the same time.  It was fantastic to have access to people who came from different walks of life and wanted to enter into politics, and maybe had different perspectives, but that was okay.  I thank the Acting Chairperson for facilitating me.  I appreciate Senator McGreehan letting me in.  I thank the Minister for being here and wish everybody a happy International Women's Day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#AAA00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Today is a day for women to celebrate but also a day for raising awareness about socioeconomic issues that affect women.  It is no exaggeration to say that women in today's society face multiple disparities, from unequal pay in their workplaces to housewife values being imposed upon them in their home life through discrepancies in the system that governs them.  All women in Ireland, irrespective of background, face sexism.  It is a systemic issue that is present in all facets of society.<\/p> <p>In the history of the Seanad, there has only been one female Cathaoirleach, Tras Honan, who was elected in 1982.  In 2018, Ireland was ranked the tenth lowest in the EU by the Central Statistics Office for representation of women in the national Parliament, with 22.2% of Deputies being women.  In the current D&aacute;il, this percentage has increased by less than 5%.  Ten counties have not elected any female independents into local government.  There are only four elected female Independent Deputies, who are Deputies Catherine Connolly, Carol Nolan, Marian Harkin and Verona Murphy, along with the five Independent Senators here.<\/p> <p>Only three women of colour are currently elected into local government, namely, Hazel Chu in Dublin, Yemi Adenuga in Meath and Uruemu Adejinmi in Longford.  No woman of colour has been elected into these Houses.  The upcoming by-election for the vacant Seanad positions was a groundbreaking opportunity for political parties to rectify the lack of representation in this House.  There is no doubt that women of colour face double the barriers that white women do.  This by-election could have been an ideal time in our history to promote our diverse political talent.<\/p> <p>I want to shed light on the problems that young women face when growing up.  My 16-year-old foster daughter wrote about her experience as a young teenage girl, stating that her experience of sexism has been covert.  Since primary school, she has noted differences in the way girls are treated as opposed to boys.  She wrote that when studying traditionally male-dominated subjects, such as technical graphics and mathematics, she finds herself being patronised by her male classmates or receiving unsolicited explanations from them.  She states that in projects, it is always easier to talk over a girl than a boy and that even in social life, girls are expected to laugh at every joke a boy makes or else be labelled stuck-up, and to brush off sexist behaviour because that is how boys are.  She writes that the pressure to crave male validation is ingrained in our culture.<\/p> <p>The next paragraph is from my 27-year-old daughter, Aoise, about her experience as a young woman in business.  She writes that she co-founded her business with two other women.  The business delivers procurement services for businesses and public sector organisations.  She states that the procurement space is not an easy one for women.  It is often led and made up of white, grey men.  She states that having spent the last number of years building the business, they have endured countless sexist encounters, been ignored at networking events, been paid less for speaking slots and have been congratulated for being a lady in business.  Would one believe that is possible?  She states that it represents a change in the way things are being done and the way business is done.  That is something to be celebrated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Today is also about celebrating women, and in that spirit I would like to herald all the independent elected women of Ireland.  Some of them have been fighting the system for years.  Some got into politics in order to create a better future for children.  I think especially today of Councillor Ann Norton in County Clare and Councillor Maeve Yore in County Louth.  Councillor Miriam Murphy in Wicklow has been a trailblazer for women with disabilities.  I also think of strong independent women like Councillor Niamh Kennedy in Donegal, Councillor Marie Casserly in Sligo, Councillor Mary Roche in Waterford and Councillor Mary Farrell in County Wexford have been elected and re-elected by their communities.  Some elected independent women found that party politics did not believe in them.  I think today of Councillor Mary Linehan Foley from Cork.  One could not find a better, hard-working councillor.  Under the guidance of Councillor Marcia D'Alton, who is passionate about the environment and protecting nature, the people of Passage West are in safe hands.  Councillor Lorna Bogue recently joined the independent ranks when she found her policies were different from those of her political party.  Nevertheless, Lorna is out there working for the people daily.<\/p><p>I want to highlight the work of the Dublin councillors &ndash; Councillors Gr&aacute;inne Maguire, Tania Doyle, Deirdre Donnelly, Anne Colgan, Noeleen Reilly and Liona O'Toole and the newly co-opted Councillor Patricia Kinsella.  Given the large population growth and the diverse needs of the people they represent, these women never stop.<\/p><p>Great women like Councillor Terry O'Flaherty from Galway and Councillor Brigid Teefy have all given decades of their lives to public life and they must be commended.  Councillors Geraldine Donohoe, Kara McHugh, Colette Connolly and Evelyn Parsons from Galway continue to be brilliant examples of politicians in the west.<\/p><p>I watch in envy daily our independent women changing communities and making a difference.  I mention Councillors Mary Kavanagh, Mags Crean and Peir Leonard in County Wicklow.  I commend the dedicated efforts of women like Councillor Anne Marie Ryan Shiner and the young M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath in Tipperary for showing leadership in their municipal areas.  The people of Kerry are equally blessed with Councillor Maura Healy-Rae.  No one would ever doubt the commitment the Healy-Raes give to their people.  I have no doubt Councillors Maura Healy-Rae and Mair&iacute;n McGrath will have a place in these Houses one day.<\/p><p>Independent Councillor Fiona McLoughlin Healy in Kildare is a strong force within local government for corporate governance.  Councillor Ida Cousins in Kildare is another tireless worker for her community.  Councillors Kathleen Shanagher and Valerie Byrne are two formidable and driving forces in County Roscommon.  It is great to see young women like Councillor Elisa O'Donovan in Limerick not being afraid to simply get out and do what needs to be done.  Last but by no means least, Councillors Amanda Smith, Gillian Toole and Geraldine Keogan are all strong public representatives for County Meath.<\/p><p>I want all the elected women of Ireland to know that I see them and I will continue to support them to deliver better for their communities.  We must now look at ways to move forward and create a more equal society.  I believe the key to this is to support women in their socioeconomic pursuits, dismantling toxic beliefs towards women and empowering female youth to recognise their talent.  In a world that oftentimes pushes women to the sidelines, we must step up and fight for the rights that we deserve and create our own platform to uplift each other.  We must take the initiative, observe the problems around us and take action to solve them.  We must work as a collective in order to ensure gender equality for future generations.  Contrary to what society has taught us, it is not a competition, it is a collaboration.  That said, I do not want today to be taken as a token and for the Minister to sympathise with us now and to forget about it tomorrow.  We are worthy of much more.  Personally, I thank all the women who have made me the person I am today and stuck with me and by me to reach my goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#BBB00200","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>It is great to be here on International Women's Day.

I do not want that for my daughters, Poppy and Heidi, nor do I want it for my sons, Charlie and George, to grow up believing that women and girls have continually to prove themselves and keep challenging those glass ceilings and walls that restrict them.<br\/><br\/>Recently I did an interview for International Women's Day with one of my local newspapers, the <i>Tullamore Tribune<\/i>.  The interview went through my childhood, early life, education and my life in politics.  I was asked if I had ever felt any of it was especially challenging as a woman and I had to think.  I could not say I particularly felt challenged because of my gender during many of the different things I have done throughout my life, from studying, working in all sorts of jobs or even life in academia.  I could easily say, however, that politics has been the most challenging thing I have done because of my gender, and entering Government seems to have opened up a whole new level of challenge.  It is not just the demands of the job, the public-facing aspect of it and managing the expectations; that is all doable.  The most challenging element is probably learning to deal with the nastiness that now seems endemic among some in our society.  While all of this applies to both male and female politicians, the personalisation towards females, in particular, is concerning, and my Government colleague, Senator Lisa Chambers, has spoken eloquently about this in the past.<br\/><br\/>In some respects, we have to become less human as we grow that thick skin deemed necessary to be a politician.  We become desensitised to the spite and, essentially, normalise this malevolent behaviour towards politicians.  To me, that is a really sad state of affairs because of all the traits we should have in our politicians, humanity should be right up there.  Someone said to me once that it goes with the territory and no one forced me to enter politics, which basically means we all have to put with it and politicians are fair game.  Should that be acceptable?  Should anyone have to put up with such abuse as part of their job?  I think not.<br\/><br\/>For me, at the moment, however, I feel I am strong enough to put with it but the same cannot be said for others.  There are also ramifications, for example, for my children and for my elderly parents, who get upset when they see abuse aimed at their daughter.  I am sure that may well be the same for other politicians, too, and their families, and that is upsetting.  What perhaps is most damaging of all is that it can be so off-putting for women, in particular, to consider entering politics in the first place.  This is besides all the other barriers we all know exist to female participation in politics.<br\/><br\/>It is well accepted now that every organisation, political or otherwise, functions better with more gender balance and more gender equality.  Political parties now have quotas for female candidates in general elections, and there have been calls for the same in local elections.  Quite simply, despite what anyone might think of this, if we do not have sufficient numbers of female candidates actually running in elections, then we will never have sufficient numbers in office, because women in politics are amazing.  There are some incredible female voices here in the Seanad across all parties and Independents, not least my own Green Party colleagues, Senators Pauline O'Reilly and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey - two formidable women indeed.  The importance of female leadership contributions cannot be overstated.  Every parliament and organisation will fail to reap the benefits by not having a gender-balanced membership.<br\/><br\/>I was pleasantly surprised to see the gender balance in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine when I joined last summer.  Of the 3,800 or so people working in the Department, nearly 1,800 are female, which is not far short of 50%.  More to the point, they are excellent colleagues working, as I have discovered, at all levels from senior management to clerical and across all areas such as administrative, inspectorate, veterinary, laboratory and professional services.  These people are really talented women.<br\/><br\/>However, beyond my Department, the agriculture sector is still heavily dominated by men.  One only has to look at the membership of the executive committees of the main farming organisations to see just how gross an imbalance there is in them.  In fact, it was a pleasure for me to meet recently with a relatively new farming organisation called Talamh Beo and it was so refreshing to see more women than men on the Zoom call, and that is important.  When I think about the many wonderful female farmers I know, they are innovative, have made changes to their farms, have taken risks and have diversified.  They have challenged the <i>status quo<\/i>, and those are exactly the characteristics we need in the farmers of the future.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The most challenging aspect of being a politician for me, and for other women I know, is being a mother.  My decision to enter politics five years ago has taken a toll on my family life.  Of that, there is no doubt.  There are sacrifices to be made and precious moments must be missed but, for me, the support of my husband, Mark, and my mother, Jeannie, has allowed me to pursue this path.  It simply could not have happened without their help.  <\/p><p>I greatly admire any woman who has managed to have a successful political career while at the same time rearing a family and, it is to be hoped, managing to have some spare time along the way.  The current President of the European Commission, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, comes to mind as a woman who is very much in charge of her brief, yet she is also a mother of seven and has juggled a prolific political career with family life, particularly when her children were young.  Who has not admired Mary O'Rourke, a five-time Minister, a Deputy for nearly 25 years and also a Senator?  Mary always speaks fondly of the essential support she received from her late husband, Enda, during her political career.<\/p><p>Yes, sisters are doing it for themselves but, behind every great woman lies what is perhaps the single greatest ingredient for success: a great man, a great partner, a great family or great friends.  On this International Women's Day, I want to celebrate that and to thank those who make it possible for women to be the best they can be because that best can simply be better than all the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#CCC00200","speaker":"1661","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here today and for taking these statements on International Women's Day.  The Minister of State has stolen my line.  We had the same first sentence.  The theme for this year's International Women's Day is \"choose to challenge\".  This indicates that a challenged world is an alert world and that from challenge comes change.  My challenge relates to who is making the decisions and who has a seat at the table.<\/p> <p>I will begin by quoting the late US Supreme Court judge, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who said \"Women belong in all places where decisions are being made.\"  To be fair, I believe that does not only apply to women.  I believe that all those affected by decisions should have a seat at the table where they are made and that we should have diversity and inclusion across all of Parliament, the Legislature.<\/p> <p>I was introduced to speaking out for women when I was a very little girl when a new church was opened in Clondalkin, where we then lived.  The priest announced from the altar on the first Sunday that he was looking for men to volunteer to be readers at mass and for women to volunteer to clean the church.  My mother was the sole objecting voice to find that announcement offensive and to challenge it.  It took the voice of a woman to point out the blatant stereotyping and discrimination.  It took a pregnant woman sitting at the Cabinet table for the blatant discrimination of the lack of maternity provision for politicians to get a proper debate and resolution.  Let us remind ourselves that this is 2021.  We will shortly celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the foundation of the State but, with regard to the function of the reproduction of our population, maternity leave for legislators is still not an entitlement.  The case for councillors is similar.  Arrangements need to be put in place to address their needs in respect of having children and childcare, an issue I urgently want addressed.<\/p> <p>Throughout the crisis, women have been disproportionately affected in terms of their sexual and reproductive health.  For example, it is difficult to get a determination from the Department of Health on whether travelling abroad for IVF treatment is deemed essential.  For a couple desperate to have a baby, as time is ticking and against them, this journey is, without doubt, absolutely essential.  The review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 has commenced.  We are now three years on and still women have to travel.  This needs to be addressed with the review.  Who will be at that table and who will conduct that review?  There are matters still outstanding including access to contraception, ensuring that sex education is universally and uniformly delivered, and ensuring a woman's safe passage to a doctor's clinic when seeking abortion services.  We need to make sure that no one is left behind in this review.<\/p> <p>There are similar issues with regard to assisted human reproduction.  Without ensuring that the right voices are at the table, we may well walk into passing an impotent law that disenfranchises most of those who need it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Oireachtas is preparing to introduce the assisted human reproduction, AHR, Bill.  The current commentary by the AHR coalition is that the legislation is not fit for purpose and ignores the calls from groups most affected by its provisions, including Equality for Children, LGBTQ groups, Surrogacy Ireland, Families for Surrogacy, 221 Plus, cystic fibrosis service advocates, the National Infertility Support and Information Group and many more.  The proposed scope for surrogacy under the Bill is limited and does not have significant cognisance of the plight of families wrestling with infertility that is medically or socially caused.  Pre-approval, altruistic, domestic provision and a raft of other models are covered, but what about the survivors of cervical cancer who are excluded from bearing their own children, those who were born without a uterus and those who are wrestling with infertility where the cause is undiagnosed and who have been abandoned to unregulated private medicine?  What about single women who want to access IVF services or all those longing to be parents?  They will be left behind by this Bill, which proposes a regime that has been in operation in Canada and the UK for some years but which is now under review because it has been shown to be not fit for purpose in how it has played out.<br\/><br\/>What of the mothers of surrogate-born children who are not recognised as mothers by the State?  They were given some comfort and status by the Children and Family Relations Act 2015, in which they were designated as custodians and guardians, but they remain susceptible to the precarious whim of their spouses for even that unsatisfactory legal status relationship with their much-longed for and loved children, the children whom they have nurtured since before conception and, through no fault of their own, could not carry in their own wombs.  What of the children already born via surrogacy, citizens of this State who are in a precarious position in terms of their entitlement to those mothers and to their inheritance rights from same?  We are leaving them behind.<br\/><br\/>We are at a juncture where the proposed legislation is drafted by those who, by the stroke of fate, have no need of it and is set to ignore the voices of those who are most crying out for it.  That is because the most affected are not at the decision-making table and the discourse about them is sometimes only short of branding them as child abusers.  Today, I welcome and embrace the theme of International Women's Day.  Today, I am choosing to challenge.  If we are to live in a truly inclusive and just society that legislates for ethics rather than morals, we must ensure that the voices not at the table are heard and acted on.<br\/><br\/>I will end with a poem written by the mother of a surrogate-born child who was unable to carry her own.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>\tNot flesh of my flesh,<br \/><br \/>nor bone of my bone,<br \/><br \/>but still miraculously my own.<br \/><br \/>Never forget for a single minute,<br \/><br \/>you didn't grow under my heart,<br \/><br \/>but in it. <\/blockquote><p>To those women who have wrestled with their fertility, I dedicate this day and my speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#EEE00200","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for attending this morning to deal with the Labour Party's Commencement matter on the gender pay gap.  I wish colleagues a happy International Women's Day.  Today has a long and proud history.  We started International Women's Day as a day of protest, struggle and socialist and feminist campaigning for women's rights.  It was only in 1977 that the United Nations recognised 8 March as an international day for women everywhere.  Only in recent years in Ireland has it become a day of celebration more than just a day of protest.  As a student in Trinity College Dublin in the 1980s, it was a day of protest and for pointing out so much that was wrong for women and so much law that needed to change, in particular laws on reproductive rights, healthcare, abortion rights and contraception.<\/p> <p>I am struck by the personal stories that Senators have told the House, how much resonance there still is and how much remains to be done.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While we are now celebrating the repeal of the eighth amendment in 2018 and the reform of much of the law that was so problematic for women in the 1980s, we still face very significant burdens and obstacles.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for acknowledging the report I compiled for the justice committee in 2019, on women's participation in politics, in which we produced a clear outline of the evidence as to the barriers women face, not just in political careers but in all careers and professions.  We named those barriers in respect of politics the five Cs but four of those Cs apply in every walk of life for women.  They are a lack of cash, a lack of confidence, an old boys' culture and a lack of access to childcare.  At every forum at which I have spoken and from any woman I know in any job or profession, I have found that those four Cs hold us back as women in our career progression.<\/p><p>In politics, as we all know, there is a fifth C, candidate selection procedures in political parties.  We sought to address that through the gender quota legislation in 2012.  That is very welcome and there has been some improvement for women in politics but, as others have said, a great deal more still needs to be done.  When the 30% quota was first introduced in the 2016 election, the proportion of elected female Deputies jumped from its previous high of 14% to 22%.  Unfortunately, however, in last year's election, there was a stagnation, with just 22.5% of Deputies being women, or 36 of 160.  In the Seanad, we are all aware of how much better we are, with 24 women of 60 Senators, or 40%, the highest we have ever had.  It makes a difference in our collegiate working, in our collaborative practices in the House and in the sort of legislation we debate.<\/p><p>I speak as someone who, when I was first elected in 2007, saw how pale, male and stale Irish politics was.  It has changed and is changing, and given that there will be a 40% gender quota for the next general election, we can all anticipate that there will be an improvement in the numbers of women not only put forward in the election as candidates but also elected.  It is not inevitable that that will happen, however, and we must keep pushing for it.  It was depressing for me to look today at the International Parliamentary Union, IPU, table and to see we have slipped again.  A year ago, we were 92nd in the world classification table for women's representation, and while that was not a cause for celebration, we are 101st today.  We have slipped down further.<\/p><p>It is not that our numbers have disimproved but that we have stood still while all around us other countries are improving, taking positive action measures and addressing those five Cs.  I refer not just to the candidate selection procedure.  Laws are being put in place in other countries that address women's lack of cash and the gender pay gap, and I am glad the Minister is moving swiftly on that.  They are addressing childcare by putting in place longer paternity leave and proper accessible childcare for women.  They are addressing all the other issues of culture and confidence through measures like those we in the Labour Party have proposed.<\/p><p>We have proposed that, for example, reproductive healthcare leave should be brought in so that women who have to take time off work for early miscarriage or IVF treatment will be enabled to do so.  That is a very important step forward for women, along with so many issues that need to be improved on.  We have today produced a manifesto called Working for Women and put forward some of the measures we think need to be taken on board by the Government.  I look forward to sending the Minister a copy and to working collaboratively with him to ensure that Ireland is a better place for women in the years and decades to come.  I hope we will not have to wait much longer to address those five Cs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#FFF00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for appearing before the House and for giving us the opportunity to make statements on International Women's Day.  Over the past few years, I have grown uncomfortable with the way in which the day is celebrated because for me, the day was borne out of the struggle of the labour movement.  In 1911, New York garment workers, mainly immigrants, marched and struck for decent, safe jobs after a fire killed 146 women in this low-paid, exploitative job.  Their battle cry was not \"lean in\", \"girl power\" or \"who runs the world?\" but that basic guttural slogan \"bread and roses\".  Today, social media platforms operated by rich tech companies profit from the online abuse of women, giving a platform to fast-fashion companies that profit from the sweat and labour of poor women, and offer discount codes to women in the name of girl power and female empowerment based on a notion that they come through purchasing power.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For me, International Women's Day is not a day about women in leadership or the corporate board, but it is a very real basic fight for safe working conditions and equality.  That is its historical context.<br\/><br\/>This morning, fast fashion companies all over the world posted messages for International Women's Day, but how does their lip service to International Women's Day stack up?  This year, Boohoo.com was exposed by <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>for poor pay and working conditions at its UK factories.  It paid an undercover reporter as little as &pound;3.50 per hour.  Many people turned to Amazon during the pandemic, but we know its workers are under so much pressure to make Jeff Bezos richer that they are not allowed to take toilet breaks.  More than a century after New York garment workers died in a devastating fire, 1,134 women died when a factory in Bangladesh collapsed.  According to the Clean Clothes Campaign, garment workers in countries such as Cambodia, Bangladesh and India work 14 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week.  That adds up to 96 hours per week.  They work in conditions where they breathe in toxic substances and accidents and fires are frequent.  Worldwide, 168 million children work in the fast fashion industry, earning as little as 22 p per day to satisfy our insatiable demand for girl boss clothing.<br\/><br\/>This International Women's Day, which is my first as a Member of this House, I want to remember the origins of the day.  I stand in solidarity with the women who are in service to the fast fashion consumer industry from which we consume.  The fight for bread and roses and the historical context of this day goes on through the fight for good quality jobs and workers' rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#GGG00200","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Gu&iacute;m L&aacute; Idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na mBan sona do gach &eacute;inne sa Teach.  I used to love International Women's Day.  It was a day to celebrate one's feminist heroes such as Kathleen Lynn - I am wearing a brooch commemorating her.  She was a proud republican woman who fought for the freedom of her State, but she also played a significant role in addressing inequalities in mothers' and children's health and in the roll-out of the vaccination for tuberculosis.  I hope the Government will review its decision not to name the national children's hospital after Dr Kathleen Lynn.<\/p> <p>International Women's Day was also a day on which we had an opportunity to protest for real and radical reform.  It may be that I am just tired now that I am in my forties, but I fear that in recent years International Women's Day has become a day when we talk a lot.  We talk about the issues that affect women, the need for change and what the changes should be, but that is it.  We talk and then the box is ticked for another year.  The email inboxes of every Member of this House will today be flooded with messages of solidarity from corporations for International Women's Day, but tomorrow those corporations will go back to exploiting their workers, predominantly women, and perpetuating the gender pay gap.<\/p> <p>On International Women's Day two years ago, the then Government ratified the Istanbul Convention on combating violence against women.   That move was welcomed by everyone in the political stream, but also by everybody who has worked on the front line of domestic violence services.  However, two years have passed and there are still nine counties in this country without a single refuge space, while the Government continues to peddle a definition of providing one refuge space per 10,000 women rather than one per 10,000 of the population.   Its choosing to use that definition makes Ireland an outlier in the EU.  What is even more disturbing is that we are not even reaching that target.  Under that definition, there should be 490 refuge spaces per head of population but currently there are only 141.  This is at a time when the incidence of domestic violence has increased by 16% since the convention was ratified, but especially in the past year with the pandemic and the impact of lockdowns.<\/p> <p>The requirement for self-isolation facilities has also reduced capacity.  Saoirse women&rsquo;s refuge in Tallaght has two emergency accommodation shelters but it has had to use one of those shelters for self-isolation, which has reduced the number of families it has been able to help.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not just in a refuge capacity that we are still failing women who are coming out of situations of domestic violence.  While legal aid for barring orders is covered under the Istanbul Convention, once a woman tries to rebuild her life after coming out of a violent situation; she can face further barriers in accessing the courts.<br\/><br\/>I mention the current discriminatory system of treating tenants who are eligible for local authority housing but who find themselves in the private rental sector due to the chronic shortage of public housing differently to local authority tenants.  This effectively means that women are being blocked from accessing the courts.  Treating the housing assistance payment, HAP, as income is preventing women from pursuing maintenance and from defending applications for access to children.  It is a deeply unfair interpretation of the law.  Every Member of this House knows that HAP is paid directly to the landlord and that it never passes the account of a tenant.  It is almost definitely a contravention of Airey <i>v.<\/i>Ireland, where it was found to be unreasonable to expect one to have to defend oneself in the courts.  By counting HAP as income, that is what this State is effectively doing and this is happening on a weekly basis, as will be confirmed by any of the domestic violence organisations.<br\/><br\/>It appears that it is not just in the case of civil legal aid where access to justice is problematic.  The lack of free legal aid for the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is also disproportionately impacting women.  In today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Eilis Barry, the chief executive of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, said that it is almost certain that many employment discrimination or sexual harassment cases are simply not being taken.  This is not because those breaches of the law are not happening.  Rather, it is because the victims do not have the resources to get representation.  While the opportunity is technically there for victims to represent themselves at the WRC, this provision does not take into account that people on lower incomes face greater levels of time poverty.  This is especially true for women who take on more care work.  Therefore, even if they wanted to represent themselves, women are at a disadvantage again.  Workers in the lowest-paid jobs are being put in a vulnerable position.  I know there is a commitment in the programme for Government to examine the issue of access to justice but it would be good to have clarity as to whether this will be an independent investigation or one that will be carried out internally within the Department of Justice.<br\/><br\/>I would like to express my solidarity with the ex-Debenhams workers who are predominantly female.  They have been on the picket line for a total of 333 days.  They have campaigned with bravery and dignity in pursuit of a fair redundancy package.  They chose to challenge the unfairness of their situation.  On International Women's Day, I call on the Government to listen to the demands of the ex-Debenhams workers.  Their first ask is to make the &euro;3 million training fund available as a cash payment and their second ask is to pass the legislation to prevent this from ever happening to workers in the future.  That would be a true acknowledgement of International Women's Day. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#HHH00200","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here.  I am going to heavily focus my contribution on women who have been impacted by Covid.  Before I do so, I want to acknowledge that when one talks about gender quotas, gender balance on boards, and the gender pay gap, for example, it sometimes feels like those issues are far away from me, my life and where I have come from.  These are conversations that we definitely do not have in my community.  If we really want to look at the intersectionality of life, women and International Women's Day, we also need to look at housing, access to child maintenance, lone parent family payments and women being able to live a life free of suffering.  These women may never have an interest in boards or decision making.  They just want to live a life free of suffering with access to healthcare and a decent standard of life and they want to be able to parent and to bring their children up in a community where they can flourish.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We have mentioned gender quotas and the theme of \"choose to challenge\".  We have an opportunity to challenge in the upcoming by-election.  We can talk about women entering politics and gender quotas but we have to move away from saying we care about female representation and actually act.  There is one black woman councillor from Longford and another woman of colour from Dublin who want to be on the ticket, but they are being blocked.  If we want to use International Women's Day to challenge and to protest, I ask those in other parties to refuse to put their names beside the other candidates running and give the nomination to women.  There is no point in just having gender quotas.  We also need to use every other opportunity to make sure women are on the ticket instead of only being forced to have them with quotas.  We have an opportunity to have two new female colleagues in here with us next month.  I ask members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party to have a think about that.  They should choose to challenge and choose to put their names beside somebody else on the ticket.  That would be a huge move for us in the Seanad this year, to make sure we give an opportunity for two women of colour to join us here next month. <\/p><p>Regarding Covid and women, we are 12 months into a global pandemic and I am spending today thinking about how the virus, its public health impacts and our policy responses to it have specifically and disproportionately affected women.  Covid-19 has hit society at all levels, including health, economics and education, and has been at the heart of our political discussions.  As we emerge from these measures, we must ensure we address the unequal and unfair impact this pandemic and its resulting restrictions have had on Ireland's women.  A recent report from the OECD, which measures female economic empowerment, has shown that the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting Government responses have disproportionately affected women.  At the end of 2021, the number of women at work will have regressed to 2017 levels, with a 2.1% drop predicted.  While Ireland has improved in reducing the pay divide between men and women, despite a lack of progression by the Government of the gender pay gap legislation, the rise in the unemployment rate here has been larger for women than males during the pandemic, as is the case in many countries.<\/p><p>When considering the health and well-being of women who have remained in work, research from the US and the UK found that working women reported chronic stress levels 40% higher than the average person.  This steadily increased with the extended restrictions.  I hope we will consider and try to understand why women are dropping out of the workforce and explore what we can do to support these women to return to work.  It is on us now to find ways to reduce the stress women are feeling across Ireland.  One key reason for job losses is the high proportion of females employed in the industries most impacted by the pandemic.  These include low-paid professions, service roles and care professions.  Further to this, the closure of schools and childcare services has increased the in-home caregiving obligations for women.  Research has often shown that women assume more care responsibilities than men and Covid-19 restrictions have added to women's burdens.  They have created a tipping point for some women in their work and home life balance that I am concerned we might not be able to rescue if we do not take radical action to rebalance the care responsibilities.<\/p><p>Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan of the ALL Institute in Maynooth University has been interviewing women and children across Ireland and examining their experiences of the pandemic.  The findings of this work to date are stark.  The research observed that fathers were less likely to reduce work hours than mothers in light of Covid-19 restrictions.  The distribution of homeschooling and childcare responsibilities was uneven.  Mothers are unfairly expected to manage work, home and education.  A survey of families undertaken by Dr. O'Sullivan revealed that 10% of mothers surveyed had lost their jobs due to the added pressure of homeschooling.  These were women in positions such as pharmacists, legal workers and many others who felt they could not manage this situation well.  A further 25% of women had reduced their working hours and over 65% reported underperforming in their work life.  Many stated that they went to bed feeling they had failed their families and their employers.  This is not breaking news.  In 2020, the United Nations stated that families' inability to access institutional and community childcare during the lockdown placed a heavier burden on women, restricting their work capacity.  One parent described her experience as \"extremely stressful to the point of causing depression.  Inadequate.  Children falling behind and suffering despite my enormous efforts\", while another stated, \"It is torture.  There are tears every day.  I hate how it affects our relationship.\"<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Another says there are tears every day and every minute, \"either mine or theirs\".  Parents report being tired and pressurised.  Home schooling causes tension with the children and makes them feel inadequate.  They describe the impact on their mental health and that of their children and how being home all day is affecting the whole family.<\/p><p>When we look at Ireland's response to Covid-19, we must consider whether the problems that have arisen have been born of the structure of the governance processes themselves.  Female representation in the Oireachtas still lags behind European levels despite the excellent work of organisations such as Women for Election, and I am lucky to sit on its board.  Even the specific institutions managing Covid-19 responses such as NPHET and the Cabinet Covid subcommittees are scandalously male.  Suppose all the decisions around schooling, employment supports and the language we use are made by men?  How can we be sure our policies are not directly affecting women?  Suppose a mother trying to manage three different children with three different home schooling scenarios has been sitting at the decision table, would we have done things differently?<\/p><p>As we enter the week of the woman and prepare to celebrate Mother's Day, we must consider the inequalities facing women and how Covid-19 has shone a light on the imbalance in home-work-life structures and the physical and emotional burdens women carry.  Public discussion around Covid-19 needs to consider its long-term impact on women and, in turn, their families.  We know the burdens of Covid-19 are causing adverse psychological outcomes and higher rates of severe psychological distress for mothers compared with men.  Some 32% of fathers and 57% of mothers reported a deterioration in mental health since the beginning of the pandemic, suggesting mothers take on a significant proportion.  With that in mind, we should rethink the support systems we have put in place and begin to use language that acknowledges the incredible sacrifices women and mothers are making to ensure our families survive.<\/p><p>N&iacute; saoirse go saoirse na mban.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#JJJ00200","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I stand here as a very proud member of mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, a descendant of our ancient warriors and modern rebels, from Queen Maeve, who battled in the mountains above my home to secure ownership of the Brown Bull of Cooley, to Granuaile the pirate queen, who proved her might on sea and was a formidable force in politics, to the more recent day heroes of my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, such as one of our founders, Constance Markievicz.  When I first learned of this woman and the other women of the early 1900s, who fearlessly fought to create a free, independent country, I could not believe there were such creatures who, amidst all the inequity, believed in something so fiercely, they went against the grain to create a new republic where equality of opportunity and equal rights were promised.  For a wee girl, who from about seven years old dreamt one day of being a Member of one of these Houses, Constance had me at \"hello\".  One of the first female Cabinet Ministers and the first woman in the world to be appointed Minister for Labour in 1919, she was elected to the D&aacute;il to sit as a Fianna F&aacute;il TD.  At the time she passed away, she was an officeholder and a representative of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It makes me so immensely proud that, in some way, we all carry on her legacy.<\/p> <p>However, women were erased from history, their involvement in our fight for the for the Republic was ignored.  They were put back in the home to give birth, to become caregivers so that the men carry on with the work they believed they were destined to do.  Ireland, in many ways, has been no country for women.  The actions of State and church have proven this over and over again.  We can look time and again at women's status, mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries, and inadequate healthcare for women.  The treatment of No&euml;l Browne back in the day, when he tried to change things and make them a little bit better for women in this country, highlights where women were on the hierarchy of our society.<\/p> <p>Today is about celebrating the many social, economic and cultural, political achievements of women.  We all have our favourites.  My mother, Carmel, my sister, Lorna, Marian Finucane, Mary O'Rourke, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, Katie Taylor, Catherina McKiernan, Justice Catherine McGuinness, and Sin&eacute;ad Burke are some of the many women who I look up to.<\/p> <p>Today is a day of celebration, but it must be a day that acts as a catalyst for change.  We need to use today to ask questions.  Why is there still so much inequity?  What can we all do, men and women?  We know change needs everyone and is not for one gender to walk alone.  Gender equality does not mean the differences between males and females disappear - far from it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Erin McGreehan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must create equity.  Equity means recognising the glorious differences by creating fairness and a new normal so we can all achieve the same outcome.  The gender pay gap is part of this inequity.  In general, women in Ireland earn 14.4% less than their male counterparts.  This is a critical issue and the pandemic has highlighted pay inequalities harshly.  For example, in the earlier waves of job losses, female workers accounted for more than half of all pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, claims.  As of 2 March 2021, the majority of women who were in receipt of the PUP were on rates below the top rate of &euro;350 per week and accounted for the majority on the lower payment rates.  The Government is progressing initiatives to address such inequalities and the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019, which will be progressed, will assist in continuing to highlight and rectify the pay gap but it cannot come fast enough.<\/p><p>We also will never be able to say that gender inequality is gone until prejudice is overcome and we have eliminated the irrational bias people can have against somebody just because they are female.  Equal rights are not enough.  This inequality also exists in our minds, our biases and prejudices and remains to be fixed.  We must tackle this unconscious bias.  For example, when I was running in the 2019 local elections, I cannot count how many times I was asked who was going to look after my children.  Imagine asking a man that question.  It is something that simply would not come up.  Moreover, the lack of inadequate childcare provision in this country is part of that unconscious bias.  Part of our bias comes from our laws, our Constitution.  We must mature as a country and realise that in cases where our Constitution, the basis for our laws, is outdated and innately biased against women, it must be changed.  Article 41.2 effectively states a woman's place is in the home.  This article refers to the State recognising the support women give in our country but it is just a platitude and platitudes do not pay the bills.  Article 41.2 must be amended to be gender-neutral and to acknowledge the role of care in Irish society and there is a reason we are catching up on providing that adequate care for our most vulnerable.  Why would the State choose to provide childcare or elder care when women were banned from the workplace?  Their place was in the home, to look after their children and when that was done, to look after their aging parents.  A women's place is where she chooses to be.  A man's place is where he chooses to be.  It is the job of the State to recognise this.  The Constitution is an important document and it should be respected and protected but it must protect all of us.<\/p><p>This brings me to the value of our care economy.  Millions of euro are provided to the State every year by men and women.  However, there is a real inconsistency: care is mostly done by women, making possible much of the paid work which drives our market economy.  Care work is also essential for advancing human capabilities, yet it tends to be unpaid.  It is undervalued and often taken for granted.  We must be radical, ambitious and willing to change.  We must establish a working group to fully examine the value of care in our economy.  It must highlight the critical contribution care workers make and help to ensure policies which recognise it.  The division of paid and unpaid work is strongly gendered.  We all know the supports for caring are at a low level and I can attest to the fact that combining paid work and caring is difficult.<\/p><p>There is so much I wish to say today but I simply do not have time.  Gender-based violence, domestic violence and abuse, be it virtual or real, must be urgently addressed.  However, today I choose to challenge.  I choose to challenge those who stand in our way and those who do not put value on diversity and difference.  I challenge us all to not leave any woman behind, to not make it an equality of privilege.  We must hear the female voices and their stories.  We need to be empowered by what women have done before us and what they have achieved in much harder times.  It means an incredible amount to me to stand here as a daughter of Carmel O'Reilly, a granddaughter of Brigid O'Neill and of Mary Rose McCann, who worked the land, created life, shaped the world and created a legacy today.  I thank them and thank the woman who made all this possible.

I want to mark my appreciation of the work of women at all levels and of all political colours who keep this place ticking over.<\/p> <p>We are all aware that public representation in Ireland has never come close to being representative of the actual public.  Less than a quarter of Deputies are women.  This House is performing a little better but we all know that is because most of my party's females were appointed.  I am very grateful for this but it is a real shame.  We have a real problem with the electoral system.  Of the women who have made it to these Houses, not just today but over the years, we were genuinely spoiled for talent.  The leaders of four parties in this House are led by women.  The Leader and Deputy Leader of the Seanad are female.  However, we all know we have an awfully long way to go.<\/p> <p>Fine Gael introduced gender quotas for general elections and they have been a major driver of increased female representation in the D&aacute;il but they are not enough.  Political parties must meet a 40% target for female candidates in respect of the general elections in 2023 to secure funding.  We all know this will ruffle feathers and that it is a blunt and cruel way for us to try to increase representation of women in politics and political life.  We do not like it, nor do we like the consistent references to us being token candidates or token women on the ticket.  The very least we need to do is create a space for women to be able to put themselves forward and create the environment.  The next step for all of us to make sure we continue to encourage women to be able to do that.  A lot of the time, female politicians speak mostly in frustration about the barriers that face us in terms of helping to increase the number of women in politics at local and national level.  While we are right to talk about the barriers - Senator Bacik spoke eloquently about them earlier on - and it is an awful pity that they are increasing rather than decreasing, when we talk about female representation, we must also talk about the balance in our arguments and the positives that female representation brings to the table.  We bring balance to the debate.  We bring an entirely different perspective based on our unique lived experience.  It might seem like a soppy thing to say but we bring empathy and a caring approach that have sometimes been lacking in political decision-making throughout the country's history.<\/p> <p>The equal involvement of women does and will provide better legislation, better outcomes and a better Ireland.  I must be honest; I am proud to be a member of Fine Gael, the party that probably has had the most female Cabinet Ministers in the history of the State but I am not proud of the fact that there has only ever been 20.  We have had our own instructive governance in this country for over 100 years but there have only been 20 females sitting around a Cabinet table during those 100 years - women like Gemma Hussey, Nora Owen and Frances Fitzgerald.  They paved the way and smashed the ceiling before us but is it not awful that when we stand here to reflect on the women we are proud of, it is the same names that keep coming up because there were so few of them?  We are proud of them but we need to be talking about the next generation.  Twenty-two women in 100 years is an absolute joke.  <\/p> <p>While we are talking about women we are all incredible proud of, I would like to be selfish for a moment and talk about the woman who has been completely instructive in my role in political life.  Maria Dalton is my mother.  She was the person who first introduced me to politics when I probably was not even out of nappies.  She brought me everywhere with her.  She brought me to meetings.  She brought me to Ard-Fheiseanna in my communion frock.  She brought me leafletting.  I was canvassing when I was big enough to walk.  My first election memory was when she ran in 1979 when I was only eight years of age.  She involved us completely in the campaign.  She is my best friend, confidante and biggest cheerleader.  She is probably my most constructive critic but I would never have made it this far without her love and support and I wanted to put that on the record of the House today.  <\/p> <p>We are choosing to challenge.  While this day is one to celebrate and reflect, women are still not treated equally in the workplace, education and sport.  The list goes on.  While Senator McGreehan is right, if we do not have a real conversation about care - children's care, elder care and self-care - we will find ourselves here in ten or 20 years' time marking International Women's Day with the same arguments like Groundhog Day.  The only way we will ever achieve equality of opportunity for women in every sphere is if men want it for us as much as we want it for ourselves.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am making the call-out today to all of our male counterparts and all our males in leading industry, medicine, education, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

I want to talk about a woman called Maureen Quigley, who chose to challenge.  She was born in 1924.  Senators can search all the history books they wish, but they will not find her.  She raised eight wonderful daughters to be strong courageous women who set about challenging life every day of their lives.  She was a woman who showed her daughters how to turn a 1 lb can of Heinz beans into 1.5 lbs of beans by pouring in half a can of water.  She was a woman who showed her charity when five Traveller children turned up at her door one evening.  As they were waiting for her to get some bread for them, they looked through the door and saw the television.  They said, \"Can we see the moving pictures, Missus?\"  She brought them in, sat them down and gave them their tea.  She did that every day so that they could watch \"Seoirse Agus Bartley\" and \"D&aacute;ith&iacute; Lacha\".  When the news came on they knew they had to go home.<\/p> <p>Maureen Quigley was my mother.  I grew up in a family of 11.  All of us idolised my father.  My mother was the engine room.  We took it that she was there.<\/p> <p>She never missed one occasion in my life.  She turned up for my instigation as an altar boy.  She was there when I went into the boy scouts and the FCA.  When I joined the British Army, she came to my passing out.  When I passed out in the Army, she was there.  When I got my degree, she was there.  She was never missing at any time in my life, and I never put any thought into it.<\/p> <p>Shortly before she died I had the privilege of arriving in the nursing home on my own one day.  She was sitting on the bed.  She sat up with a big smile.  She asked me what I was doing there.  I said I came down to visit her.  I said that on the way down I had thought about something and she asked what it was.  I said I thought about the extraordinary influence she had had on my life.  I said I would never have done anything but for the strong silent motivation that she provided for me and my brothers and sisters.  She said, \"Stop that now, stop that\".  Yet, she did.  She drove all of us on to do wonderful things.  If my father or mother had known I would be standing here today, I am unsure what they would have make of it.<\/p> <p>The second woman I want to talk about is a girl called Rebecca.  Rebecca is my daughter.  I am so in awe of her that I cannot begin to tell Senators.  That is not forgetting my wife.  My wife of course was the strong woman behind my daughter.  My daughter, Rebecca, was struck with cancer of the tongue at 19 years of age.  What should have been a wonderful career path for her has been damaged by constant setbacks with health.  She could have had a setback one day when I would go to meet her in a hospital or wherever she would be.  She could be in tears.  I would then go in the following day and she would be sitting up in the bed determined to get back to life.  She has lived that way every day since she was 19 years of age.  She is now in her 40s.  Good God, I love and respect her courage and strength.<\/p> <p>We may talk about choosing to challenge but not everyone is going to be able to challenge for equal pay or equal rights.  I want to talk to the mothers who chose to give up a career and stay at home to make their children the best they could be.  I want to respect them.  I wish to God the State would respect them and treat them properly, because we do not treat them properly.<\/p> <p>I want to remember the women who had children on their own.  This will come up here soon.  I am referring to the right of children to have their birth certificate.  I have to say that I know some women who had children when they were young and single.  They were castigated by society and left that behind them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

On my way here, I pass the Countess Markievicz plaque on North Frederick Street and there is a bust of Countess Markievicz in Leinster House.  She is an iconic woman in Fianna F&aacute;il history and in our country's history.  We can all own her.  It is in her shadow that we all try to aspire to make some small contribution.  <\/p> <p>On a personal level, I thank all of the women in my life.  I come from a long line of very strong women who faced very significant challenges but did so always with great courage, resilience and heart.  I am so privileged and I never forget that.  I thank all of the women I have met in my life outside of my family who have been a friend, be that in New York when I was starting out and had nothing or in Dublin, in politics and in my professional life.  I have always operated in male-dominated environments.  We live in a male-dominated world; it is a fact of life.  Many men have been a friend to me too and I acknowledge that.  I also acknowledge the support of my husband and sons and my dad as well.  <\/p> <p>International Women's Day has been celebrated since the early 1900s.  It started with women in New York city demanding better pay, better working conditions and the right to vote.  We have come a long way, but we still have a long road ahead of us.  It is great that the first citizen of Dublin city is a woman, Hazel Chu, that the Leader of this House is a woman and also that the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad is a woman.  There is still so much we need to do to achieve equality.<\/p> <p>Today, I think also of all of the women with whom I come into contact as a public representative.  As public representatives constituents often come to us at a moment of crisis.  There are many women - I accept there are also men in this situation but it is largely women - who are victims of the housing crisis that still grips our country.  For all of those women, I challenge all of us and the Government to use our time in office to tackle the housing crisis.  The Government has an ambitious and radical plan, but we need to work collectively to deliver a radical change in terms of the State's role in the provision of housing so that there is a sustainable supply of social and affordable housing provided such that every person in our country will have a place to call home.  It is only when one has looked into the eyes of a mother, a father or an individual who does not know where he or she, or his or her family, is going to spend the night that one can see and experience the anxiety and fear that nobody living in our society should have to endure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Minister, as the Government representative here today, to remind the members of the Cabinet that women need to believe and will support this Government when it is ambitious and radical in its efforts to tackle the housing crisis.  I do not only mean using public lands to deliver social and affordable housing, but also championing the right to housing and taking forward the proposal for a constitutional referendum to insert the right to housing for all of our citizens in our Constitution.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for the work he has done so far in trying to provide some justice to the survivors of mother and baby homes.  I ask him to redouble his efforts.  I know he is moving forward by giving the survivors justice through access to their birth certificates and an opportunity to reclaim their identities.  He needs to continue his efforts, as I know he knows, because all of those women and survivors are depending on him.  I wish him courage.  He has all of our support in his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#PPP00300","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I have enjoyed the past half an hour, listening to everyone's statements and the stories that have been told.  There has been a richness to the stories about our families and the strong women in our lives, including our mums and grandmothers.  It hits me that we are very fortunate.  All of those women lived through hard times such as the war-torn years in the 1940s, and we know the infant mortality rates in that time.  They lived through times of recession and emigration.  I sometimes wonder how we are here today at all, when I hear the stories.  My mum always paid tribute to a woman in our village, Mrs. Hall, the midwife, who came around and delivered the babies safely.  I remember thinking that if it were not for women like her in villages and towns all around Ireland, I do not know what would have happened.<\/p> <p>We have talked about many things today.  International Women's Day is about equality for women.  I heard Senator Chambers state that only 24% of councillors are women.  What we are going to do about that?  We have had positive quotas for general elections but we also need to have those quotas at local election level.  I was a councillor.  It has been a whirlwind for me; I do not know how I am here, sitting in this House.  It has only been two years since I got involved in a community action group.  I was then elected in the 2019 local elections and now have the wonderful opportunity of being here, representing the place from which I come.  Sometimes being a representative of one's local area is about speaking for that area and the men, women and children who live there.  We must bring people forward and encourage women to run for office.  We have such strong women.  I was involved in a recent campaign for a cycle way and dealt with different towns and villages about different routes.  The women who got involved were amazing.  They were all managing development groups or Tidy Towns groups.  They were the organisers.  Why are we not seeing more of those women coming through in local elections?  Why are they not the ones who we are bringing forward?  That would be positive and we need something like quotas for local elections.<\/p> <p>I will speak to some of the points that the Minister made in his speech.  I am a spokesperson for further and higher education.  I spoke earlier about the fact that women comprise only 26% of professorship roles.  I understand that it is about equality at every level but I believe that unless women are at the decision-making table, we are not going to change what it is like for women in the rest of society.  It is not going to happen.  We need to see women on television, speaking as experts, and professors in all areas.  We need more women as experts, leaders and CEOs in all our organisations.  At the moment, only 12% of our organisations have a female CEO.  We need more women acting as chairpersons and appointees of boards.  It is not enough to sit back and say that it will happen because it will not.  It has not happened in the past ten, 20, 30 or 40 years.  When I thought about equality when I was in college, I thought I had the same rights as everybody else.  Did I?  Do I?  When I say that, I am talking a little about recruitment because when it comes to recruiting for positions in education, businesses, workplaces or the Oireachtas, who is doing the recruiting?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to make sure that our assessment and recruitment panels are balanced.  We need to make sure that what we are being judged for in the qualifications for the role is balanced and that when advertisements for different roles and positions are placed, they take into account qualities and criteria that favour both men and women.  They should be gender-balanced criteria.  Recruitment is a key issue for me because unless we have fair recruitment practices, balance will not happen.  I am a strong believer that unconscious bias is a problem and that we need to have something to tackle it.  It has been proven through Nobel Prize winners and yet unconscious bias training is somehow seen as not being effective and that we should do away with it without having anything in its place.  We need to have unconscious bias training and we need people to acknowledge that there is unconscious bias that we do not realise.  That has to be part of this.<br\/><br\/>Some people mentioned our public representatives.  It is important that we have representation of men and women in this House from many different backgrounds.  Councillor Yemi Adenuga has been mentioned.  She is one of our councillors of colour and she will be launching <i>Proud to Serve<\/i>, with stories of 28 women who have been in this House.  I know Mary O'Rourke who lives near me in Athlone.  Mary Harney is originally from Ahascragh in east Galway.  There is a hotbed of activity by political and public representatives in that area.  I will ask the Minister, in his role relating to children and families, to address family resource centres and how, with Covid, we will support children in areas covered by DEIS and Pobal.  Women are feeling the impact of Covid-19, especially single parents.  I will be asking the Minister about how we provide family resource centres for some of these areas and would appreciate his support for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#QQQ00200","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>On International Women's Day, there tends to be much reflection on the women who have gone before and the firsts.  I am grateful to those women who have laid the path for many of us but I find myself thinking of the women who are yet to come and not just those who have been.  I ask myself who is not in this room.  There are not nearly enough women, even though this is the most women that we have had in a Seanad, and there never have been.  This goes for the D&aacute;il too.  There has never been a woman of colour in the Seanad or a woman who has lived through direct provision.  Senator Eileen Flynn is the only woman from the Traveller community to be a Member and this place is richer and better for Senator Flynn being here.  How many more would wish to be here, in the D&aacute;il and on local county councils, who simply cannot get there?  No trans woman has ever been elected to the Oireachtas and as long as this House, which is here to represent all the people of Ireland, does not have these women in it, it is incomplete.  As Senators, we all have a say on who will be here in the future, in our votes and in our influence in political groupings, and we all have work to do in our own parties.<\/p><p>I also think of the women of Ireland who, in this most unusual and challenging year, have, as always, stepped up to the plate.  We have all heard the statistics before about women taking on a far larger share of domestic work, childcare and care for elderly family members than their male counterparts.  We have seen that workload skyrocket this year.  It includes full-time child carers and teachers.  Early indicators suggest that women are, as per usual, being left to carry the burden of this extra work.  Women are paid less at work and expected to do more work in the home for no pay.<\/p><p>A tweet by my Labour Party friend, Hannah Deasy, over the weekend really struck a chord with me, stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI used to love #InternationalWomensDay but a year into the pandemic I feel hollow looking at many #IWD2021 events.  Where is paid sick leave?  Where is paid maternity &amp;amp; parental leave?  Where is publicly funded childcare?  These are the things that create #genderequality <\/blockquote> <p>For International Women's Day, I want to remind people not only of the women who are in this room.  Electoral politics is only a small part of effecting societal change, and thinking about the women who are in this room is all well and good.  It is a little bit lean in feminism for me.  We need to reflect on the women who are truly carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders for little or no recognition and even more insultingly, little to no pay.  I hope that this time next year, we will have made great strides in addressing some of those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#RRR00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>It is good to see the Minister in the Chamber.

These are women who had to retire early, who were forced to leave their work because of caring responsibilities or who have lost their job and are not seeking work any longer.  I think today of the women who have been in contact with me who have children with intellectual disabilities who have had no services available to them on and off for nearly 12 months at this stage.  They were forced to leave their job.  I also think of the couple who were both essential front-line workers who made a decision in September for the woman to leave her job because they felt they would not be able to provide cover for their children if one of the children had to leave school due to being a close contact.  There are plenty more like those women.  There are other women who have had to take unpaid leave because they simply could not find childcare for their children under the age of one year.  I am pleased to see the Bill to extend parental leave will be debated in the House this Friday, but it is nearly eight months since the Government announced the extension of parental leave.  Eight months is too long for women to have been hanging on, who with no option but to stay at home from work because they could not get childcare.<\/p><p>While the pandemic has not been great for women in the workplace, it is not all bad.  Some 45,000 women lost their part-time jobs last year or moved out of part-time employment, but there was an increase of 15,000 women in full-time employment.  The ability to work from home has provided opportunities for some women who previously could not work full time to do so now.<\/p><p>I will conclude on a positive note.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to bring forward the legislation to deal with the gender-pay gap legislation in the next fortnight.  I very much welcome the EU directive on pay transparency introduced by the European Commission last week.  I hope the Government will support that.  If we are serious about improving the lot of low-paid women in this country it is important that the Government would support the EU directive on adequate minimum wages.  We know that approximately 29% of all women are in low-paid work and two thirds of all those on the minimum wage are women, so it is vital that the Government supports the directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#RRR00300","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>We are running very tight on time.

I thank my wonderful, beautiful colleagues for their contributions.<\/p><p>We have all heard the statistics on the gender-pay gap and women working two months for free every year but we do very little about it.  As Senator Dolan outlined, in the state of Ontario in Canada they have brought in significant legislation on recruitment such as pay-transparency legislation.  It increases the transparency in hiring practices, so when a company advertises for a position, it must clearly state the salary.  It is illegal not to do so.  There is also a bar on asking candidates what their previous salary was.  They also have a framework for tracking and reporting the wages of both men and women, in the same way that we do.  The pay-transparency measure is a huge step.<\/p><p>We all clapped when we heard there would be special legislation that would allow us to work at home, but we must be cautious when we consider legislation for working at home because of what was described in an article in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>as women's invisible jobs, which is generally caring for children and managing the household.  We will probably flock towards the idea of working from home but sometimes it might be to the detriment of younger women who are not already established in their career.  We must be careful and put proper safeguards in place to ensure that women are not taking a step backwards by working at home.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We all know in large companies, and even around Leinster House, that if one is not in every day making connections and building a network then one will fall behind.

So one must be mindful in this House and in every house of childcare, and the State needs to provide childcare for free.  In March, we gave a little hat tip to free child care because the State paid childcare for month but then cut it off completely.  We need to revisit providing free childcare and the issue should come within the ambit of the Department of Education.  The Government must listen to women and take childcare very seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#SSS00300","speaker":"1630","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>It will be hard for me to squeeze my five-minute speech into two and half minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#TTT00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#TTT00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>We cannot help but focus on Covid today and the inequitable effect that it has had on women.  What are we going to do about it?  We cannot allow for these experiences and insights to merely become ink on reports or for us to sleepwalk into a global she-session going back on progress that we have made in women's economic participation.  The structural inequalities that exist are staring us in the face right now more than ever and we need to see action, investment and long-term change.<\/p> <p>I hope to touch on three things, the first of which is remote working.  Employers faced major upheaval when, overnight, they moved their employees to their homes but the next stage of upheaval will be whenever employees return to their offices.  These people need to be managed fairly and I am specifically talking about office workers.  Despite the fact that only 40% of home workers at the moment are women, we cannot allow remote work to be gendered or for those to opt to work from home or remotely to be viewed, or treated, as any less ambitious than people present in the office.  If offices return to a culture based on physical presenteeism then there will inequality, so the Government must be proactive in helping to establish a new work culture based on equal opportunities.  The Government can do so by encouraging the use of technology first, which is basically what companies are doing now but merged and integrated into the office environment.  We need a communications campaign on best practice for how to do that and how to bring companies through the hybrid transition.  I am worried that not enough companies are talking about the hows of the hyper transition.<\/p> <p>The national remote working strategy is fantastic.  It is committed to introducing the right to request to work remotely.  It will enhance our commitments under the EU work-life balance directive which requires EU member states to introduce the right to request flexible working arrangements for carers and working parents of children aged from zero up to eight years.  I believe that we can go further than that.  Not everyone works in roles that can be done remotely, has access to adequate remote work spaces or wants to work remotely even if they could.  If we do not want flexible work to be gendered or stereotyped then we need to go beyond parents and carers and offer it to everybody.  Let us look to Finland where, in 2017, Finnish fathers spent as much time with their children as mothers, and the gender employment gap was less than 2% in 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#TTT00400","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I must cut the Senator off because the debate is already over time, and Senators Crowe and Martin did express a wish to speak but I told them that they could not.

One is the free contraception scheme for women aged 17 to 25 years that was promised in the programme for Government.  Personally, I would prefer universal access to free contraception as recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution but this limited scheme is a good start.

I know a lot about the legal aid system and the family law matters discussed in the District Court such as maintenance, custody, access and guardianship.  These payments are taken into account when assessing income, which rules many people out.  This is an absolutely outrageous situation.  Vulnerable women and their children are those primarily being left behind by this.  Going to court on one's own because the State has failed to provide one with a council house and one has to rely on the HAP system is a scary prospect and absolutely outrageous.<\/p><p>There is a lot more I could say on International Women's Day.  Many of my colleagues here in the Chamber have touched on issues.  I hope that next year, when Covid has receded, we will be able to have a debate over a full day to allow us to tease out all of these issues rather than rushing through them in a very short session.

One could not call it a debate.  It was a really engaging conversation from the very beginning and all the way through.  Everyone brought up really poignant topics in their contributions across the whole two hours.<\/p> <p>It is amazing when one sits down and reflects on one's own time and how one ended up in politics.  For me personally, it goes back to my mother.  There was a pothole down the road from where we lived so she drove into the council office one day.  The pothole had been there for quite a length of time.  She went in and told PJ in the office that the pothole was back again.  PJ told her not to worry and that council workers would be out later.  She told him that she would sit in the car and follow them out.  That shows a little bit about us.  If women want to do things, they just get into it and do it.  That tells us a little bit about us.  That is how we got here.  We persevered.  We broke our own personal glass ceilings to get here.  Whether we got here in an independent capacity or through a party, we have all faced challenges.  Of that, there is no doubt.  Some of us are single women, some have had to deal with childcare and some have had to deal with health issues.  I do not remember who mentioned it but someone pointed out that one gets asked questions like \"How will you cope?\", \"How will the family manage?\" and \"Who will mind the kids?\"  The guilt starts straight away before one even puts one's name on a ballot paper.  Senator Dolan spoke about subconscious and unconscious biases.  That was a valuable contribution.  We need to start challenging unconscious biases and wondering what they mean.<\/p> <p>I need to share another experience with the ladies in the House.  They may know that I ran for election to the European Parliament back in the day.  One day, I found myself in Dunboyne or Ashbourne.  The car was pulled in and I was eating a little bit of lunch.  There was a knock at the window.  I looked out and saw the Leader of the Seanad, Senator Doherty.  When she came over I pointed out that I was in her neck of the woods.  She asked me to get out of the car and take a photograph.  I said that she was with the other side but she said that strong women should support strong women.  That tells us a little bit about us.  We need to be able to support each other.  For far too long, we did not.  <\/p> <p>One of the wonderful things that happened in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il was the founding of the women's caucus.  I extend my reverence to the chair of the current women's caucus, Senator O'Loughlin.  The caucus gives us opportunities to have conversations that are always left on the periphery and which never make their way through those magical brown doors.  There are many issues that need to be the focus of conversation, some of which Senator Clifford-Lee mentioned.  Time and again, they fail to make their way in here.  Period poverty was one such issue knocking on the door of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il and which is now being addressed in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il.  The Senator also talked about maintenance.  That is a very significant issue in all of our council areas.  It is a barrier to women's existence.  Senator Fitzpatrick talked about having to look into the eyes of a person who does not know where they will sleep that night, where the front door is or where their children can crawl about.  She also spoke about the ambitious housing plan.  These are really concrete issues that need to be discussed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I had a speech prepared, but I took down notes as the debate progressed.  We talk about women in sport, the 20x20 campaign and so on.  Women do not need to make it into the Oireachtas to be a positive influence on young girls.  It is all down to the nice teacher they meet in national school or the woman on the sports pitch who shows young girls how to pick up or kick a ball.  The same goes for gymnastics.  It gives girls a bit of extra time and coaching.  As they say in the mental health field, all you need is one.  It is the same for women who want to make their way through - we just need one sounding board, one to push us through, one to say we can do it, one to reinforce us.<\/p><p>While that would be wonderful, we also need to go back to where it starts, namely, at the council and, before that, the Tidy Towns committees in which we were all involved.  We can consider the numbers on councils currently.  It is fantastic to listen to the National Women's Council and to hear that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and local government are supporting initiatives to develop the outreach model of the caucus system of councils regionally, as we do not have enough women.  We do not have that diverse voice.  It sometimes pains me to hear that local councils cannot get enough women onto education and training boards, ETBs.  While legislation requires a proper board composition, women cannot get onto them because it might disturb who sits in what chair on some strategic policy committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#UUU00200","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Jobs for the boys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#VVV00200","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>That is what goes on and we have to call it out.  There is no point in us talking about percentages.  They are only as good as what follows on from them.  Without mentioning specifics, I have experience on a county council where females could not make their way onto an ETB because the boys would not leave even though that meant the board was not meeting its structural requirements.<\/p> <p>There is so much more to do, but I feel empowered because there are such strong women inside the gates of Leinster House and there are great jobs to be done.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I are passionate about our roles and doing what we can from within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  For example, as long as I am also in the Department of Health, I will raise the issue of contraception.  Two Senators mentioned endometriosis.  We will do our work and I look forward to working with everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021030800002#VVV00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1615199400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank everyone.
